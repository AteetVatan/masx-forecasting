The committees met, pursuant to notice, at 9:07 a.m. in room 1202, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Senator Daniel K. Inouye-(chairman - of the Select Committee on Intelligence) presiding. Present: Senators Inouye (presiding), Kennedy, Goldwater, Bayh, Hathaway, Huddleston, Hart, Schweiker, Case, Garn, Chafee, Lugar and Wallop. Also present: William G. Miller, staff director, Select Committee on Intelligence; Dr. Lawrence Horowitz, staff director, Subcommittee on Health and Scientific Research; and professional staff members of both committees. Senator INOUYE. The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence is meeting today and is joined by the Subcommittee on Health and Scientific Research chaired by Senator Edward Kennedy of Mas- sachusetts and Senator Richard Schweiker of Pennsylvania. Senator Hathaway and Senator Chafee are members of both committees. We are to hear testimony from the Director of Central Intelligence, Adm. Stansfield Turner, and from other Agency witnesses on issues concern- ing new documents supplied to the committee in the last week on drug testing conducted by the Central Intelligence Agency. It should be made clear from the outset that in general, we are focusing on events that happened over 12 or as long as 25 years ago. It should be emphasized that the programs that are of greatest con- cern have stopped and that we are reviewing these past events in order to better understand what statutes and other guidelines might be necessary to prevent the recurrence of such abuses in the future. We also need to know and understand what is now being done by the CIA in the field of behavioral research to be certain that no current abuses are occurring. I want to commend Admiral Turner for his full cooperation with this committee and with the Subcommittee on Health in recognizing that this issue needed our attention. The CIA has assisted our com- mittees and staffs in their investigative efforts and in arriving at remedies which will serve the best interests of our country. The reappearance of reports of the abuses of the drug testing pro- gram. and reports of other previously unknown drug programs and projects for behavioral control underline the necessity for effective oversight procedures both in the executive branch and in the Con- gress. The Select Committee on Intelligence has been working very closely with President Carter, the Vice President, and Admiral Turner and his associates in developing basic concepts for statutory guidelines which will govern all activities of the intelligence agencies of the United States. In fact, it is my expectation that the President will soon announce his decisions on how he has decided the intelligence agencies of the United States shall be organized. This committee will be working closely with the President and Admiral Turner in placing this new structure under the law and to develop effective oversight procedures. It is clear that effective oversight requires that information must be full and forthcoming. Full and timely information is obviously necessary if the committee and the public is to be confident that any transgressions can be dealt with quickly and forcefully. One purpose of this hearing is to give the committee and the public an understanding of what new information has been discovered that adds to the knowledge already available from previous Church and Kennedy inquiries, and to hear the reasons why these documents were not available to the Church and Kennedy committees. It is also the purpose of this hearing to address the issues raised by any additional illegal or improper activities that have emerged from the files and to develop remedies to prevent such improper activities from occurring again. Finally, there is an obligation on the part of both this committee and the CIA to make every effort to help those individuals or institu- tions that may have been harmed by any of these improper or illegal activities. I am certain that Admiral Turner will work with this com- mittee to see that this will be done. I would now like to welcome the most distinguished Senator from Massachusetts, the chairman of the Health Subcommittee, Senator Kennedy. Senator KENNEDY. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. We are delighted to join together in this very important area of public in- quiry and public interest. Some 2 years ago, the Senate Health Subcommittee heard chilling testimony about the human experimentation activities of the Central Intelligence Agency. The Deputy Director of the CIA revealed that over 30 universities and institutions were involved in an "extensive testing and experimentation" program which included covert drug tests on unwitting citizens "at all social levels, high and low, native Americans and foreign." Several of these tests involved the adminis- tration of LSD to "unwitting subjects in social situations." At least one death, that of Dr. Olsen, resulted from these activities. The Afrency itself acknowledged that these tests made little scientific sense. The agents doing the monitoring were not qualified scientific observers. The test subjects were seldom accessible beyond the first hours of the test. In a number of instances, the test subject became ill for hours or days, and effective followup was impossible. Other experiments were equally offensive. For example, heroin addicts were enticed into participating in LSD experiments in order to get a reward-heroin. Perhaps most disturbing of all was the fact that the extent of ex- perimentation on human subjects was unknown. The records of all these activities were destroyed in January 1973, at the instruction of then CIA Director Richard Helms. In spite of persistent inquiries by both the Health Subcommittee and the Intelligence Committee, no additional records or information were forthcoming. And no one- no single individual--could be found who remembered the details, not the Director of the CIA, who ordered the documents destroyed, not the official responsible for the program, nor any of his associates. We believed that the record, incomplete as it was, was as complete as it was going to be. Then one individual, through a Freedom of In- formation request, accomplished what two U.S. Senate committees could not. He spurred the agency into finding additional records per- taining to the CIA's program of experimentation with human subjects. These new records were discovered by the agency in March. Their existence was not made known to the Congress until July. The records reveal a far more extensive series of experiments than had previously been thought. Eighty-six universities or institutions were involved. NeV instances of unethical behavior were revealed. The intelligence community of this Nation, which requires a shroud of secrecy in order to operate, has a very sacred trust from the American people. The CIA's program of human experimentation of the fifties and sixties violated that trust. It was violated again on the day the bulk of the agency's records were destroyed in 1973. It is violated each time a responsible official refuses to recollect the details of the program. The best safeguard against abuses in the future is a complete public accounting of the abuses of the past. I think this is illustrated, as Chairman Inouye pointed out. These are issues, are questions that happened in the fifties and sixties, and go back some 15, 20 years ago, but they are front page news today, as we see in the major newspapers and on the television and in the media of this country; and the reason they are, I think, is because it just con- tinuously begins to trickle out. sort of, month after month, and the best way to put this period behind us, obviously, is to have the full information, and I think that is the desire of Admiral Turner and of the members of this committee. The Central Intelligence Agency drugged American citizens with- out their knowledge or consent. It used university facilities and per- sonnel without their knowledge. It funded leading researchers, often without their knowledge. These institutes, these individuals, have a right to know who they are and how and when they were used. As of today, the Agency itself refuses to declassify the names of those institutions and individuals, quite appropriately, I might say, with regard to the individuals under the Privacy Act. It seems to me to be a fundamental responsibility to notify those individuals or institutions, rather. I think many of them were caught up in an unwitting manner to do research for the Agency. Many researchers, distinguished researchers, some of our most outstanding members of our scientific community, involved in this network, now really do not know whether they were involved or not, and it seems to me that the whole health and climate in terms of our university and our scientific and health facilities are entitled to that response. So, I intend to do all I can to persuade the Agency to, at the very least, officially inform those institutions and individuals involved. Two years ago, when these abuses were first revealed, I introduced legislation, with Senator Schweiker and Senator Javits, designed to minimize the potential for any similar abuses in the future. That legislation expanded the jurisdiction of the National Commission on Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research to cover all federally funded research involving human subjects. The research initially was just directed toward HEW activities, but this legislation covered DOD as well as the CIA. This Nation has a biomedical and behavioral research capability second to none. It has had for subjects of HEW funded research for the past 3 years a system for the protection of human subjects of bio- medical and behavioral research second to none, and the Human Ex- perimentation Commission has proven its value. Today's hearings and the record already established underscore the need to expand its jurisdiction. The CIA supported that legislation in 1975, and it passed the Senate unanimously last year. I believe it is needed in order to assure all our people that they will have the degree of protection in.human ex- perimentation that they deserve and have every right to expect. Senator INOUITE. Thank you very much. Now we will proceed with the hearings.. Admiral Turner? [The prepared statement of Admiral Turner follows:] PREPARED STATEMENT OF ADMIRAL STANSFIELD TURNER, DIRECTOR OF CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE Mr. Chairman: In my letter to you of July 15, 1977, I reported our recent dis- covery of seven boxes of documents related to Project MKULTRA, a closely held CIA project conducted from 1953-1964. As you may recall, MKULTRA was an "umbrella project" under which certain sensitive subprojects were funded, in- volving among other things research on drugs and behavioral modification. Dur- ing the Rockefeller Commission and Church Committee investigations in 1975, the cryptonym became publicly known when details of the drug-related death of Dr. Frank Olson were publicized. In 1953 Dr. Olson, a civilian employee of the Army at Fort Detrick, leaped to his death from a hotel room window in New York City about a week after having unwittingly consumed LSD administered to him as an experiment at a meeting of LSD researchers called by CIA. Most of what was known about the Agency's involvement with behavioral drugs during the investigations in 1975 was contained in a report on Project MKULTRA prepared by the Inspector General's office in 1963. As a result of that report's recommendations, unwitting testing of drugs on U.S. citizens was subsequently discontinued. The MKULTRA-related report was made available to the Church Committee investigators and to the staff of Senator Kennedy's Sub- committee on Health. Until the recent discovery, it was believed that all of the MKULTRA files dealing with behavioral modification had been destroyed in 1973 on the orders of the then retiring Chief of the Office of Technical Service, with the authorization of the then DCI, as has been previously reported. Almost all of the people who had had any connection with the aspects of the project which interested Senate investigators in 1975 were no longer with the Agency at that time. Thus, there was little detailed knowledge of the 1IKULTRA sub- projects available to CIA during the Church Committee investigations. This lack of available details, moreover, was probably not wholly attributable to the destruction of MKULTRA files in 1973; the 1963 report on MKULTRA by the Inspector General notes on page 14: "Present practice is to maintain no records of the planning and approval of test programs." When I reported to you last on this matter, my staff had not yet had an opportunity to review the newly located material in depth. This has now been accomplished, and I am in a position to give you a description of the contents of the recovered material. I believe you will be most interested in the following aspects of the recent discovery: How the material was discovered and why it was not previously found; The nature of this recently located material; How much new information there is in the material which may not have been previously known and reported to Senate investigators; and What we believe the most significant aspects of this find to be. To begin, as to how we discovered these materials. The material had been sent to our Retired Records Center outside of Washington and was discovered there as a result of the extensive search efforts of an employee charged with re- sponsibility for maintaining our holdings on behavioral drugs and for responding to Freedom of Information Act requests on this subject. During the Church Committee investigation in 1975, searches for MKULTRA-related material were made by examining both the active and retired records of all branches of CIA considered at all likely to have had association with MKULTRA documents. The retired records of the Budget and Fiscal Section of the Branch responsible for such work were not searched, however. This was because financial papers as- sociated with sensitive projects such as MKULTRA were normally maintained by the Branch itself under the project file, not by the Budget and Fiscal Section. In the case at hand, however, the newly located material was sent to the Re- tired Records Center in 1970 by the Budget and Fiscal Section as part of its own retired holdings. The reason for this departure from normal procedure is not known. As a result of it, however, the material escaped retrieval and destruction in 1973 by the then-retiring Director of the Office as well as discovery in 1975 by CIA officials responding to Senate investigators. The employee who located this material did so by leaving no stone unturned in his efforts to respond to FOIA requests. He reviewed all listings of material of this Branch stored at the Retired Records Center, including those of the Budget and Fiscal Section and, thus, discovered the MKULTRA-related docu- inents which had been missed in the previous searches. In sum, the Agency failed to uncover these particular documents in 1973 in the process of attempting to destroy them; it similarly failed to locate them in 1975 in response to the Church Committee hearings. I am convinced that there was no attempt to conceal this material during the earlier searches. Next, as to the nature of the recently located material, it is important to realize that the recovered folders are finance folders. The bulk of the material in them consists of approvals for advance of funds, vouchers, accountings, and the like-most of which are not very informative as to the nature of the activities that were undertaken. Occasional project proposals or memoranda comment- ing on some aspect of a subproject are scattered throughout this material. In general, however, the recovered material does not include status reports or other documents relating to operational considerations or progress in the various subprojects, though some elaboration of the activities contemplated does appear. The recovered documents fall roughly into three categories: First, there are 149 MKULTRA subprojects, many of which appear to have some connection with research into behavioral modification, drug acquisition and testing or administering drugs surreptitiously. Second, there are two boxes of miscellaneous MKULTRA papers, including audit reports and financial statements from "cut-out" (i.e., intermediary) funding mechanisms used to conceal CIA's sponsorship of various research projects. Finally, there are 33 additional subprojects concerning certain intelligence activities previously funded under MKULTRA which have nothing to do either with behavioral modification, drugs, and toxins or with any other re- lated matters. We have attempted to group the activities covered by the 149 subprojects into categories under descriptive headings. In broad outline, at least, this presents the contents of these files. The activities are placed in the following 15 categories: 6 1. Research into the effects of behavioral drugs and/or alcohol: 17 subprojects probably not involving human testing; 14 subprojects definitely involving tests on human volunteers; 19 subprojects probably including tests on human volunteers. While not known, some of these subprojects may have included tests on unwitting sub- jects as well; 6 subprojects involving tests on unwitting subjects. 2. Research on hypnosis: 8 subprojects, including 2 involving hypnosis and drugs in combination.' 3. Acquisition of chemicals or drugs: 7 subprojects. 4. Aspects of magicians' art useful in covert operatibns: e.g., surreptitious de- livery of drug-related materials: 4 subprojects. 5. Studies of human behavior, sleep research, and behavioral changes during psychotherapy: 9 subprojects. 6. Library searches and attendance at seminars and international conferences on behavioral modification: 6 subprojects. 7. Motivational studies, studies of defectors, assessment, and training tech- niques: 23 subprojects. 8. Polygraph research : 3 subprojects. 9. Funding mechanisms for MKULTRA external research activities: 3 subprojects. 10. Research on drugs, toxins, and biologicals in human tissue; provision of exotic pathogens and the capability to incorporate them in effective delivery systems: 6 subprojects. 11. Activities whose objectives cannot be determined from available documen- tation : 3 subprojects. 12. Subprojects involving funding support for unspecified activities connected with the Army's Special Operations Division at Ft. Detrick, Md. This activity is outline in Book I of the Church Oommittee Report, pp. 388-389. (See Appendix A, pp. 68-69. Under CIA's Project MKNAOMI, the Army Assisted CIA in develop- ing, testing, and maintaining biological agents and delivery systems for use against humans as well as against animals and crops. The objectives of these subprojects cannot be identified from the recovered material beyond the fact that the money was to be used where normal funding channels would require more written or oral justification than appeared desirable for security reasons or where operational considerations dictated short lead times for purchases. About $11,000 was involved during this period 1953-1960: 3 subprojects. 13. Single subprojects in such areas as effects of electro-shock, harassment tech- niques for offensive use, analysis of extrasensory perception, gas propelled sprays and aerosols, and four subprojects involving crop and material sabotage. 14. One or two subprojects on each of the following: "Blood Grouping" research, controlling the activity of animals, energy storage and transfer in organic systems; and stimulus and response in biological systems. 15. Three subprojects cancelled before any work was done on them having to do with laboratory drug screening, research on brain concussion, and research on biologically active materials to be tested through the skin on human volunteers. Now, as to how much new the recovered material adds to what has previously been reported to the Church Committee and to Senator Kennedy's Subcommittee on Health on these topics, the answer is additional detail, for the most part: e.g., the names of previously unidentified researchers and institutions associated on either a witting or unwitting basis with MKULTRA activities, and the names of CIA officials who approved or monitored the various subprojects. Some new sub- stantive material is also present: e.g., details concerning proposals for experi- mentation and clinical testing associated with various research projects, and a possibly improper contribution by CIA to a private institution. However, the principal types of activities included have, for the most part, either been outlined to some extent or generally described in what was previously available to CIA in the way of documentation and was supplied by CIA to Senate investigators. For example: Financial disbursement records for the period 1960-1964 for 76 of the 149 numbered MKULTRA subprojects had been recovered from the Office of Finance by CIA and were made available to the Church Committee investigators in August or September 1975. The 1963 Inspector General report on MKULTRA made available to both the Church Committee and Senator Kennedy's Subcommittee mentions electro-shock and harassment substances (pp. 4, 16) ; covert testing on unwitting U.S. citizens (PP. 7, 10-12) ; the search for new materials through arrangements with special- ists in universities, pharmaceutical houses, hospitals, state and federal institu- tions, and private research organizations (pp. 7, 9) ; and the fact that the Tech- nical Service Division of CIA had initiated 144 subprojects related to the control of human behavior between 1953-1963 (p. 21). The relevant section of a 1957 Inspector General report on the Technical Serv- ice Division was also made available to the Church Committee staff. That report discusses techniques for human assessment and unorthodox methods of com- munication (p. 201) ; discrediting and disabling materials which can be covertly administered (pp 201-202) ; studies on magicians' arts as applied to covert oper- ations (p. 202) ; specific funding mechanisms for research performed outside of CIA (pp. 202-203, 205) ; research being done on "K" (knockout) material, alcohol tolerance, and hypnotism (p. 203) ; research on LSD (p. 204) ; anti-personnel harassment and assassination delivery systems including aerosol generators and other spray devices (pp. 206-208) ; the role of Fort Detrick in support of CIA's Biological/Chemical Warfare capability (p. 208) ; and material sabotage research (p. 209). Much of this material is reflected in the Church Committee Report, Book I, pp. 385-422. (See Appendix A, pp. 65-102). The most significant new data discovered are, first, the names of researchers and institutions who participated in the MKULTRA project and, secondly, a possibly improper contribution by CIA to a private institution. We are now in possession of the names of 185 non-government researchers and assistants who are identified in the recovered material dealing with the 149 subprojects. The names of 80 institutions where work was done or with which these people were affiliated are also mentioned. The institutions include 44 colleges or universities, 15 research foundations or chemical or pharmaceutical companies and the like, 12 hospitals or clinics (in ad- dition to those associated with universities), and 3 penal institutions. While the identities of some of these people and institutions were known previously, the discovery of the new identities adds to our knowledge of MKULTRA. The facts as they pertain to the possibly improper contribution are as follows: One project involves a contribution of $375,000 to a building fund of a private medical Institution. The fact that a contribution was made was previously known; indeed it was mentioned in a 1957 Inspector General report on the Technical Service Division of CIA, pertinent portions of which had been re- viewed by the Church Committee staff. The newly discovered material, however, makes it clear that this contribution was made through an intermediary, which made it appear to be a private donation. As a private donation, the contribution was then matched by federal funds. The institution was not made aware of the true source of the gift. This project was approved by the then DCI, and concurred in by CIA's top management at the time, including the then General Counsel who wrote an opinion supporting the legality of the contribution. The recently discovered documents give a greater insight into the scope of the unwitting drug testing but contribute little more than that. We now have col- laborating information that some of the unwitting drug testing was carried on in safehouses in San Francisco and New York City, and we have identified that three individuals were involved In this undertaking as opposed to the previously reported one person. We also know now that some unwitting testing took place on criminal sexual psychopaths confined at a State hospital and that, additional- ly, research was done on a knock-out or "K" drug in parallel with research to develop pain killers for cancer patients. These, then are the principal findings identified to date in our review of the recovered material. As noted earlier,. we believe the detail on the identities of researchers and institutions involved in CIA's sponsorship of drugs and be- havioral modification is a new element and one which poses a considerable prob- lem. Most of the people and institutions involved are not aware of Agency sponsorship. We should certainly assume that the researchers and institutions which cooperated with CIA on a witting basis acted in good fai-th and in the belief that they were aiding their government in a legitimate and proper purpose. I believe we all have a moral obligation to these researchers and institutions to protect them from any unjustified embarrassment or damage to their reputations which revelation of their identities might bring. In addition, I have a legal obligation under the Privacy Act not to publicly disclose the names of the in- dividual researchers without their consent. This is especially true, of course, for those researchers and institutions which were unwitting participants in CIA- sponsored activities. Nevertheless, recognizing the right and the need of both the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and the Senate Subcommittee on Health to investigate the circumstances of these activities in whatever detail they consider necessary, I am providing your Committee with all of the names on a classified basis. I hope that this will facilitate your investigation while protecting the individuals and institutions involved. Let me emphasize that the MKULTRA events are 12 to 25 years in the past. I assure you that the CIA is in no way engaged in either witting or unwitting testing of drugs today. Finally, I am working closely with the Attorney General and with the Secre- tary of Health, Education and Welfare on. this matter. We are making available to the Attorney General whatever materials he may deem necessary to any investigation he may elect to undertake. We are working with both the Attorney General and the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare to determine whether it is practicable from this new evidence to attempt to identify any of the persons to whom drugs may have been administered unwittingly. No such names are part of these records, but we are working to determine if there are adequate clues to lead to their identification; and if so, how to go about fulfilling the Government's responsibilities in the matter. TESTIMONY OF ADM. STANSFIELD TURNER, DIRECTOR OF CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE, ACCOMPANIED BY FRANK LAUBINGER, OFFICE OF TECHNICAL SERVICES; AL BRODY, OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL; ERNEST MAYERFIELD, OFFICE OF GENERAL COUNSEL; AND GEORGE L. CARY, LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL Admiral TURNER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to begin by thanking you and Senator Kennedy for having a joint hearing this morning. I hope this will expedite and facilitate our getting all the information that both of your committees need into the record quickly. I would like also to thank you both for prefacing the remarks today by reminding us all that the events about which we are here to talk are 12- to 24-years old. They in no way represent the current activities or policies of the Central Intelligence Agency. What we are here to do is to give you all the information that we now have and which we did not previously have on a subject known as Project MKULTRA, a project which took place from 1953 to 1964. It was an umbrella project under which there were numerous sub- projects for research, among other things, on drugs and behavioral modification. What the new material that we offer today is a sup- plement to the considerable material that was made available in 1975, during the Church committee hearinas, and also to the Senate Sub- committee on Health and Scientific Research. At that time, the CIA offered up all of the information and docu- ments it believed it had available. The principal one available at that time that gave the greatest amount of information on this subject was a report of the CIA's Inspector General written in 1963, and which led directly to the termination of this activity in 1964, 13 years ago. The information available in 1975 to the various investigating groups was indeed sparse, first because of the destruction of material that took place in 1973. as detailed by Senator Kennedy a minute ago, with the concurrence of the then Director of Central Tntelliaence and under the supervision of the Director of the Office of Technical Services that supervised Project MKULTRA. The material in 1975 was also sparse because most of the CIA people who had been involved in 1953 to 1964 in this activity had retired from the Agency. I would further add that I think the material was sparse in part because it was the practice at that time not to keep detailed records in this category. For instance, the 1963 report of the Inspector General notes: - Present practice is to maintain no records of the planning and approval of test programs. In brief, there were few records to begin with and less after the destruction of 1973. What I would like to do now, though, is to proceed and let you know what the new material adds to our knowledge of this topic, and I will start by describing how the material was discovered and why it was not previously discovered. The material in question, some seven boxes, had been sent to our Retired Records Center outside of the Washington area. It was discovered there as the result of an extensive search by an employee charged with the responsibility for maintain- ing our holdings on behavioral drugs and for responding to Freedom of Information Act requests on this subject. During the Church committee investigation of 1975, searches for MKULTRA-related material were made by examining both the active and the retired records of all of the branches of CIA considered likely to have had an association with MKULTRA documents. The retired records of the Budget and Fiscal Section of the branch that was respon- sible for such work were not searched, however. This was because the financial paper associated with sensitive projects such as MKULTRA were normally maintained by the branch itself under the project title, MKULTRA, not by the Budget and Fiscal Section under a special budget file. In the case at hand, however, this newly located material had been sent to the Retired Records Center in 1970 by the Budget and Fiscal Section of this branch as part of its own retired holdings. In short, what should have been filed by the branch itself was filed by the Budget and Fiscal Section, and what should have been filed under the project title, MKULTRA, was filed under budget and fiscal matters. The rea- son for this departure from the normal procedure of that time is simply not known, and as a result of it, however, the material escaped retrieval and destruction in 1973, as well as discovery in 1975. The employee who located this material did so by leaving no stone unturned in his efforts to respond to a Freedom of Information Act request, or several of them, in fact. He reviewed all of the listings of material of this branch, stored at the Retired Records Center, including those of the Budget and Fiscal Section, and thus discovered the MKULTRA-related documents, which had been missed in the previous searches. In sum, the agency failed to uncover these particular documents in 1973, in the process of attempting to destroy them. It similarly failed to locate them in 1975, in response to the Church committee hearings. I am personally persuaded that there is no evidence of any attempt to conceal this material during the earlier searches. Moreover, as we will discuss as we proceed, I do not believe the material itself is such that there would be a motive on the part of the CIA to withhold this, having disclosed what it did in 1975. Next, let me move to the nature of this recently located material. It is important to remember what I have just noted, that these folders that were discovered are finance folders. The bulk of the material in them consists of approvals for the advance of funds, vouchers, and accountings and such, most of which are not very informative as to the nature of the activities that they were supporting. Occasional proj- ect proposals or memoranda commenting on some aspect of a subproject are scattered throughout this material. In general, however, the re- covered material does not include overall status reports or other docu- ments relating to operational considerations, or to the progress on various subprojects, though some elaboration of the activities contem- plated does appear from time to time. There are roughly three categories of projects. First, there are 149 MKULTRA subprojects, many of which appear to have some connec- tion with research into behavioral modification, drug acquisition and testing, or administering drugs surreptitiously. Second, there are two boxes of miscellaneous MKULTRA papers, including audit reports and financial statements from intermediary funding mechanisms used to conceal CIA sponsorship of various research projects. Finally, there are 33 additional subprojects concerning certain in- telligence activities previously funded under MKULTRA but which have nothing to do either with behavioral modifications, drugs and toxins, or any closely related matter. We have attempted to group the activities covered by the 149 sub- projects into categories under descriptive headings. In broad outline, at least, this presents the contents of these files. The following 15 categories are the ones we have divided these into. First, research into the effects of behavioral drugs and/or alcohol. Within this, there are 17 projects probably not involving human test- ing. There are 14 subprojects definitely involving testing on human volunteers. There are 19 subprojects probably including tests on human 'volunteers and 6 subprojects involving tests on unwitting human beings. Second, there is research on hypnosis, eight subprojects, including two involving hypnosis and drugs in combination. Third, there are seven projects on the acquisition of chemicals or drugs. Fourth, four subprojects on the aspects of the magician's art, useful in covert operations, for instance, the surreptitious delivery of drug- related materials. Fifth, there are nine projects on studies of human behavior, sleep research, and behavioral change during psychotherapy. Sixth, there are projects on library searches and attendants at semi- nars and international conferences on behavioral modifications. Seventh, there are 23 projects on motivational studies, studies of defectors, assessments of behavior and training techniques. Eighth, there are three subprojects on polygraph research. Ninth, there are three subprojects on funding mechanisms for MKULTRA's external research activities. Tenth, there are six subprojects on research on drugs, toxins, and biologicals in human tissue, provision of exotic pathogens, and the capability to incorporate them in effective delivery systems. Eleventh, there are three subprojects on activities whose nature simply cannot be determined. Twelfth, there are subprojects involving funding support for un- specified activities conducted with the Army Special Operations Divi- sion at Fort Detrich, Md. This activity is outlined in Book I of the Church committee report, pages 388 to 389. (See Appendix A, pp. 68-69). Under CIA's Project MKNAOMI, the Army assisted the CIA in developing, testing, and maintaining biological agents and delivery systems-for use against humans as well as against animals and crops. Thirteenth, there are single subprojects in such areas as the effects of electroshock, harassment techniques for offensive use, analysis of extrasensory perception, gas propelled sprays and aerosols, and four subprojects involving crop and material sabotage. Fourteenth, one or two subprojects on each of the following: blood grouping research; controlling the activities of animals; energy stor- age and transfer in organic systems; and stimulus and response in biological systems. Finally, 15th, there are three subprojects canceled before any work was done on them having to do with laboratory drug screening, re- search on brain concussion, and research on biologically active materials. Now, let me address how much this newly discovered material adds to what has previously been reported to the Church committee and to Senator Kennedy's Subcommittee on Health. The answer is basi- cally additional detail. The principal types of activities included in these documents have for the most part been outlined or to some extent generally described in what was previously available in the way of documentation and which was supplied by the CIA to the Senate investigators. For example, financial disbursement records for the period of 1960 to 1964 for 76 of these 149 subprojects had been recovered by the Office of Finance at CIA and were made available to the Church committee investigators. For example, the 1963 Inspector General report on MKULTRA made available to both the Church committee and the Subcommittee on Health mentions electroshock and harass- ment substances, covert testing on unwitting U.S. citizens, the search for new materials through arrangements with specialists in hospitals and universities, and the fact that the Technical Service Division of CIA had initiated 144 subprojects related to the control of human behavior. For instance also, the relevant section of a 1957 Inspector General report was also made available to the Church committee staff, and that report discusses the techniques for human assessment and un- orthodox methods of communication, discrediting and disabling ma- terials which can be covertly administered, studies on magicians' arts as applied to covert operations, and other similar topics. The most significant new data that has been discovered are, first, the names of researchers and institutions who participated in MKULTRA projects, and second, a possibly improper contribution by the CIA to a private institution. We are now in the posses- sion of the names of 185 nongovernment researchers and assistants who are identified in the recovered material dealing with these 149 subprojects. There are also names of 80 institutions where work was done or with which these people were affiliated. The institutions include 44 colleges or universities, 15 research foundation or chemical or pharma- ceutical companies or the like, 12 hospitals or clinics, in addition to those associated with the universities, and 3 penal institutions. While the identities of some of these people and institutions were known previously, the discovery of the new identities adds to our knowledge of MKULTRA. The facts as they pertain to the possibly improper contribution are as follows. One project involves a contribution of $375,000 to a build- ing fund of a private medical institution. The fact that that con- tribution was made was previously known. Indeed, it was mentioned in the 1957 report of the Inspector General on the Technical Service Division of CIA that supervised MKULTRA, and pertinent portions of this had been reviewed by the Church committee staff. The newly discovered material, however, makes it clear that this contribution was made through an intermediary, which made it ap- pear to be a private donation. As a private donation, the contribution was then matched by Federal funds. The institution was not made aware of the true source of the gift. This project was approved I- the then Director of Central Intelligence and concurred in by CIA's top management including the then General Counsel, who wrote an opinion supporting the legality of the contribution. The recently discovered documents also give greater insight into the scope of the unwitting nature of the drug testing, but contribute little more than that. We now do have corroborating information that some of the unwitting drug testing was carried out in what is known in the intelligence trade as safe houses in San Francisco and in New York City, and we have identified that three individuals were in- volved in this undertaking, whereas we previously reported there was only one person. We also know now that some unwitting testing took place on crimi- nal sexual psychopaths confined at a State hospital, and that addi- tionally research was done on a knockout or K drug in parallel with research to develop painkillers for cancer patients. These, then, are the principal findings identified to date in our re- view of this recovered material. As noted earlier, we believe the de- tail on the identities of researchers and institutions involved in CIA sponsorship of drug and behavioral modification research is a new element and one which poses a considerable problem. Most of the peo- ple and institutions involved were not aware of CIA sponsorship. We should certainly assume that the researchers and institutions which cooperated with CIA on a witting basis acted in good faith and in the belief that they were aiding their Government in a legitimate and proper purpose. I believe that we all have a moral obligation to these researchers and institutions to protect them from any unjustified embarrassment or damage to their reputations which revelation of their identities might bring. In addition, I have a legal obligation under the Privacy Act not to publicly disclose the names of the individual researchers without their consent. This is especially true, of course, for those researchers and institu- tions which were unwitting participants in CIA sponsored activities. Nonetheless, Mr. Chairman, I certainly recognize the right and the need of both the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and the Senate Subcommittee on Health and Scientific Research to investigate the circumstances of these activities in whatever detail you consider necessary. I am providing your committee with all of the documenta- tion, including all of the names, on a classified basis. I hope that this will facilitate your investigation while still protecting the individuals and the institutions involved. Let me emphasize again that the MKULTRA events are 12 to 24 years in the past, and I assure you that CIA is in no way engaged in either witting or unwitting testing of drugs today. Finally, I am working closely with the Attorney General on this matter. We are making available to the Attorney General whatever materials he may deem necessary to any investigations that he may elect to undertake. Beyond that, we are also working with the Attorney General to determine whether it is practicable from this new evidence to identify any of the persons to whom drugs may have been admin- istered unwittingly. No such names are part of these records. We have not identified the individuals to whom drugs were administered, but we are trying now to determine if there are adequate clues to lead to their identification, and if so how best to go about fulfilling the Gov- ernment's responsibilities in this matter. Mr. Chairman, as we proceed with that process of attempting to identify the individuals and then determining what is our proper re- sponsibility to them, I will keep both of these committees fully ad- vised. I thank you, sir. Senator INouYE. Thank you very much, Admiral Turner. Your spirit of cooperation is much appreciated. I would like to announce to the committee that in order to give every member an opportunity to participate in this hearing, that we would set a time limit of 10 minutes per Senator. Admiral Turner, please give this committee the genesis of MKUL TRA. Who or what committee or commission or agency was responsi- ble for dreaming up this grandiose and sinister project, and why was it necessary? What is the rationale or justification for such a project and was the President of the United States aware of this? Admiral TURNER. Mr. Chairman. I am going to ask Mr. Brody on my right, who is a long-time member of the CIA to address that in more detail. I believe everything that we know about the genesis was turned over to the Church committee and is contained in that ma- terial. Basically, it was a CIA-initiated project. It started out of a concern of our being taken advantage of by other powers who would use drugs against our personnel, and it was approved in the Agency. I have asked the question you just asked me, and have been assured that there is no evidence within the Agency of any involvement at higher echelons, the White House, for instance, or specific approval. That does not say there was not, but we have no such evidence. 96-408 0 - 77 - 2 Mr. Brody, would you amplify on my comments there, please? Mr. BRODY. Mr. Chairman, I really have very little to add to that. To my knowledge, there was no Presidential knowledge of this proj- ect at the time. It was a CIA project, and as the admiral said, it was a project designed to attempt to counteract what was then thought to be a serious threat by our enemies of using drugs against us. Most of what else we know about it is in the Senate Church committee report. Senator INOUYE. Were the authorized members of the Congress made aware of this project through the budgetary process? Mr. BRODY. We have no knowledge of that, sir. Senator INOUYE. Are you suggesting that it was intentionally kept away from the Congress and the President of the United States? Admiral TURNER. No, sir. We are only saying that we have no evi- dence one way or the other as to whether the Congress was informed of this particular project. There are no records to indicate. Senator INOUYE. Admiral Turner, are you personally satisfied by actual investigation that this newly discovered information was not intentionally kept away from the Senate of the United States ? Admiral TURNER. I have no way to prove that, sir. That is my con- viction from everything I have seen of it. Senator INOUYE. Now, we have been advised that these documents were initially discovered in March of this year, and you were notified in July of this year, or June of this year, and the committee was noti- fied in July. Can you tell us why the Director of Central Intelligence was notified 3 months after its initial discovery, why the delay? Admiral TURNER. Yes, sir. All this started with several Freedom of Information Act requests, and Mr. Laubinger on my left was the in- dividual who took it upon himself to pursue these requests with great diligence, and got permission to go to the Retired Records Center, and then made the decision to look not only under what would be the ex- pected subject files, but through every file with which the branch that conducted this type of activity had any conceivable connection. Very late in March, he discovered these seven boxes. He arranged to have them shipped from the Retired Records Center to Washing- ton, to our headquarters. They arrived in early April. He advised his appropriate superiors, who asked him how long he thought it would take him to go through these and screen them appropriately, clear them for Freedom of Information Act release. There are, we originally estimated, 5,000 pages here. We now think that was an underestimation, and it may be closer to 8,000 pages. He estimated it would take about 45 days or into the middle of May to do that. He was told to proceed, and as be did so there was nothing uncovered in the beginning of these 149 cases that appeared particu- larly startling or particularly additive to the knowledge that had al- ready been given to the Church committee, some details, but no major revelations: He and his associates proceeded with deliberateness, but not a great sense of urgency. There were other interfering activities that came and demanded his time also. He was not able to put 100 percent of his time on it, and there did not appear to be cause for a great rush here. We were trying to be responsive to the Freedom of Information Act request within the limits of our manpower and our priorities. In early June, however, he discovered two projects, the one related to K drugs and the one related to the funding at the institution, and realized immediately that he had substantial new information, and he immediately reported this to his superiors. Two actions were taken. One was to notify the lawyers of the prin- cipal Freedom of Information Act requestor that we would have sub- stantial new material and that it would be forthcoming as rapidly as possible, and the second was to start a memorandum up the chain that indicated his belief that we should notify the Senate Select Comi- mittee on Intelligence of this discovery because of the character at least of these two documents. As that proceeded up from the 13th of June, at each echelon we had to go through the legal office, the legislative liaison office and at each echelon about the same question was asked of him: Have you gone through all of this, so that when we notify the Senate Select Com- mittee we do not notify half of the important relevations and not the other half? The last thing I want, Mr. Chairman, is in any way to be on any topic, give the appearance on any topic of being recalcitrant, reluctant, or having to have you drag things out of me, and my sub- ordinates, much to my pleasure, had each asked, have you really gone through these 8,000 pages enough to know that we are not going to uncover a bombshell down -at the bottom? By late June, about the 28th, this process reached my deputy. He notified me after his review of it on the 7th of July, which is the first I knew of it. I began reading into it. I asked the same probing ques- tion directly. I then notified my superiors, and on the 15th delivered to you my letter letting you know that we had this, and we have been working, many people, many hours since then, to be sure that what we are telling you today does include all the relevant material. Senator INOUYE. I would like to commend Mr. Laubinger for his diligence and expertise, but was this diligence the result of the Free- dom of Information Act or could this diligence have been exercised during the Church hearings? Why was it not exercised? Admiral TURNER. There is no question that theoretically this dili- gence could have been exercised at any time, and it may well be that the Freedom of Information Act has made us more aware of this. Would you speak for yourself, please. Mr. LAUBINGER. I really don't attribute it, Senator, to diligence so much as thoroughness. If you can imagine the pressures under an organization trying to respond, which I think the CIA did at the time of the Church committee hearings, the hallways of the floor I am on were full of boxes from our records center. Every box that anyone thought could possibly contain anything was called up for search. It was one of a frantic effort to comply. When the pressure of that situation cools down, and you can start looking at things systematically, you are apt to find things that you wouldn't under the heat of a crash program, and that is what happened here. Senator INOUYE. Thank you very much. Senator Kennedy? Senator KENNEDY. Admiral Turner, this is an enormously distress- ing report that you give to the American Congress and to the American people today. Granted, it happened many years ago, but what we are basically talking about is an activity which took place in the country that involved the perversion and the corruption of many of our out- standing research centers in this country, with CIA funds, where some of our top researchers were unwittingly involved in research spon- sored by the Agency in which they had no knowledge of the back- ground or the support for. Much of it was done with American citizens who were completely unknowing in terms of taking various drugs, and there are perhaps any number of Americans who are walking around today on the east coast or west coast who were given drugs, with all the kinds of physical and psychological damage that can be caused. We have gone over that in very careful detail, and it is significant and severe indeed. I do not know what could be done in a less democratic country that would be more alien to our own traditions than was really done in this narrow area, and as you give this report to the committee, I would like to get some sense of your own concern about this type of activity, and how you react, having assumed this important responsibil- ity with the confidence of President Carter and the overwhelming support, obviously, of the. Congress, under this set of circumstances. I did not get much of a feeling in reviewing your statement here this morning of the kind of abhorrence to this type of past activity which I think the American people would certainly deplore and which I believe that you do, but could you comment upon that question, and also perhaps give us what ideas you have to insure that it cannot happen again? Admiral TURNER. Senator Kennedy, it is totally abhorrent to me to think of using a human being as a guinea pig and in any way jeopardiz- ing his life and his health, no matter how great the cause. I am not here to pass judgment on my predecessors, but I can assure you that this is totally beyond the pale of my contemplation of activities that the CIA or any other of our intelligence agencies should undertake. I am taking and have taken what I believe are adequate steps to insure that such things are not continuing today. Senator KENNEDY. Could you tell us a little bit about that? Admiral TURNER. I have asked for a special report assuring me that. there are no drug activities extant, that is, drug activities that involve experimentation. Obviously, we collect intelligence about drugs and druo use in other countries, but there are no experimentations being conducted by the Central Intelligence Agency, and I have had a special check made because of another incident that was uncovered some years ago about the unauthorized retention of some toxic materials at the CIA. I have had an actual inspection made of the storage places and the certification from the people in charge of those that there are no such chemical biological materials present in our keeping, and I have issued express orders that that shall not be the case. Beyond that, I have to rely in large measure on my sense of com- mand and direction of the people and their knowledge of the attitude I have just expressed to you in this regard. Senator KENNEDY. I think that is very commendable. Admiral TURNER. Thank you, sir. Senator KENNEDY. I think it is important that the American people understand that. 17 You know, much of the research which is our area of interest that was being done by the Agency and the whole involved sequence of ac- tivities done by the Agency, I am convinced could have been done in a legitimate way through the research programs of the National Insti- tutes of Mental Health, other sponsored activities. I mean, that is some other question, but I think you went to an awful lot of trouble, where these things could have been. Let me ask you specifically, on the followup of MKULTRA, are there now-I think you have answered, but I want to get a complete answer about any experimentations that are being done on human be- ings., whether it is drugs or behavioral alterations or patterns or any support, either directly or indirectly, being provided by the Agency in terms of any experimentation on human beings. Admiral TURNER. There is no experimentation with drugs on human beings, witting or unwitting, being conducted in any way. Senator KENNEDY. All right. Or being supported indirectly? I mean, are you contracted out? Admiral TURNER. Or being in any way supported. Senator KENNEDY. All right. How about the nondrug experimenta- tion our Committee has seen-psychosurgery, for example, or psy- chological research? Admiral TURNER. We are continually involved in what we call as- sessment of behavior. For instance, we are trying to continually im- prove our polygraph procedures to, you know, assess whether a person is lying or not. This does not involve any tampering with the individ- nal body. This involves studying records of people's behavior under different circumstances, and so on, but it is not an experimental thing. Have I described that accurately, Al? Mr. BRODY. Yes. Senator KENNEDY. Well, it is limited to those areas? Admiral TURNER. Yes; it does not involve attempting to modify be- havior. It only involves studying behavior conditions, but not trying to actively modify it, as was one of the objectives of MKULTRA. Senator KENNEDY. Well, we are scarce on time, but I am interested in the other areas besides polygraph where you are doing it. Maybe you can either respond now or submit it for the record, if you would do that. Would you provide that for the record? Admiral TURNER. Yes. [The material on psychological assessments follows:] Psychological assessments are performed as a service to officers in the opera- tions directorate who recruit and/or handle agents. Except for people involved in training courses, the subjects of the assessments are foreign nationals. The assessments are generally done to determine the most successful tactic to persuade the subject to accept covert employment by the CIA, and to make an appraisal of his reliability and truthfulness. A majority of the work is done by a staff of trained psychologists, some of whom are stationed overseas. The assessments they do may be either direct or indirect. Direct assessments involve a personal interview of the subject by the psychologist. When possible the subject is asked to complete a formal "intelli- gence test" which is actually a disguised psychological test. Individuals being assessed are not given drugs, nor are they subjected to physical harassment or torture. When operating conditions are such that a face-to-face interview is not possible, the psychologist may do an indirect assessment, using as source ma- terials descriptions of the subject by others, interviews with people who know him, specimens of his writings, etc. The other psychological assessments involve handwriting analysis or grapho- logical assessment. The work is done by a pair of trained graphologists, assisted by a small number of measurement technicians. They generally require at least a page of handwritten script by the subject. Measurements are made of about 30 different writing characteristics, and these are charted and furnished to the graphologist for assessments. The psychologists also give courses in psychological assessment to group of operations officers, to sharpen their own capabilities to size up people. As part of the training course, the instructor does a psychological assessment of each student. The students are witting participants, and results are discussed with them. It is important to reiterate that psychological assessments are only a service to the operations officers. In the final analysis, it is the responsibility of the operations officer to decide how a potential agent should be approached, or to make a judgement as to whether any agent is telling the truth. Admiral TURNER. The kind of thing we are interested in is, what will motivate a man to become an agent of the United States in a diffi- cult situation. We have to be familiar with that kind of attitudinal response that we can expect from people we approach to for one reason or another become our spies, but I will be happy to submit a very specific listing of these. Senator KENNEDY. Would you do that for the committee? In the followups, in the MKSEARCH, in the OFTEN, and the CHICKWIT, could you give us also a report on those particular programs? Admiral TURNER. Yes, sir. Senator KENNEDY. Did they involve experimentation, human experimentation? Admiral TURNER. No, sir. Senator KENNEDY. None of them? Admiral TURNER. Let me say this, that CHICKWIT program is the code name for the CIA participation in what was basically a Depart- ment of Defense program. This program was summarized and re- ported to the Church committee, to the Congress, and I have since they have been rementioned in the press in the last 2 days here, I have not had time to go through and personally review them. I have ascertained that all of the files that we had and made available before are intact, and I have put a special order out that nobody will enter those files or in any way touch them without my permission at this point, but they are in the Retired Records Center outside of Washington, and they are available. I am not prepared to give you full details on it, because I simply haven't read into that part of our history, but in addition I would sug- gest when we want to get into that we should get the Department of Defense in with us. Senator KENNEDY. Well, you will supply that information to the Intelligence Committee, the relevant, I mean, the health aspects, obvi- ously, and the research we are interested in? Admiral TURNER. Yes, sir. Senator KENNEDY. Will you let us know, Admiral Turner? Admiral TURNER. I will be happy to. [See p. 169 for the material referred to.] Senator KENNEDY. Thank you. I am running out of time. Do you support the extension of the protection of human subjects legislation to include the CIA and the DOD? You commented favorably on that before, and I am hopeful we can get that on the calendar early in September, and that is our strong interest. Admiral TURNER. The CIA certainly has no objection to that pro- posed legislation, sir. It is not my role in the administration to be the supporter of it or the endorser of it. Senator KENNEDY. As a personal matter, since you have reviewed these subjects, would you comment? I know it is maybe unusual, but you can understand what we are attempting to do. Admiral TURNER. Yes, sir. Senator KENNEDY. From your own experience in the agency, you can understand the value of it. Just finally, in your own testimony now with this additional infor- mation, it seems quite apparent to me that you can reconstruct in very careful detail this whole project in terms of the responsible CIA officials for the program. You have so indicated in your testimony. Now with the additional information, and the people, that have been revealed in the examination of the documents, it seems to be pretty clear that you can track that whole program in very careful detail, and I would hope, you know, that you would want to get to the bottom of it, as the Congress does as well. I will come back to that in my next round. Thank you very much. Senator INOUYE. Senator Goldwater? Senator GOLDWATER. I have no questions. Senator INOUYE. Senator Schweiker? Senator SCHWEIKER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Admiral Turner, I would like to go back to your testimony on page 12, where you discuss the contribution to the building fund of a private medical institution. You state, "Indeed, it was mentioned in a 1957 Inspector General report on the Technical Service Division of CIA, pertinent portions of which had been reviewed by the Church committee staff." I would like to have you consider this question very carefully. I served as a member of the original Church committee. My staffer did a lot of the work that you are referring to here. He made notes on the IG's report. My question to you is, are you saying that the section that specifically delineates an improper contribution was in fact given to the Church committee staff to see? Admiral TURNER. The answer to your question is "Yes." The infor- mation that a contribution had been made was made available, to the best of my knowledge. Senator SCHWEIKER. Only certain sections of the report were made available. The report had to be reviewed out at Langley; it was not reviewed here, and copies were not given to us here. I just want you to carefully consider what you are saying, because the only record we have are the notes that the staff took on anything that was of significance. Admiral TURNER. My understanding was that Mr. Maxwell was shown the relevant portion of this report that disclosed that the con- tribution had been made. Senator SCHWEIKER. To follow this up further, I'd like to say that I think there was a serious flaw in the way that the IG report was handled and the Church committee was limited. I am not making any accusations, but because of limited access to the report, we have a situ- ation where it is not even clear whether we actually saw that material or not, simply because we could not keep a copy of the report under the procedures we had to follow. We were limited by notetaking, and so it is rather ambiguous as to just what was seen and what was not seen. I certainly hope that the new Intelligence Committee will not be bound by procedures that so restrict its ability to exercise effective oversight. I have a second question. Does it concern you, Admiral, that we used a subterfuge which resulted in the use of Federal construction grant funds to finance facilities for these sorts of experiments on our own people? Because as I understand what you are saying, while the CIA maybe only put up $375,000, this triggered a response on the part of the Federal Government to provide on a good faith basis matching hospital funds at the same level. We put up more than $1 million of matching funds, some based on an allegedly private donation which was really CIA money. Isn't there something basically wrong with that? Admiral TURNER. I certainly believe there is. As I stated, the Gen- eral Counsel of the CIA at that time rendered a legal opinion that this was a legal undertaking, and again I am hesitant to go back and revisit the atmosphere, the laws, the attitudes at that time, so whether the counsel was on good legal ground or not, I am not enough of a lawyer to be sure, but it certainly would occur to me if it happened today as a very questionable activity. Senator SCH1WEIKER. Well, I think those of us who worked on and amended the Hill-Burton Act and other hospital construction as- sistance laws over the years, would have a rather different opinion on the legal intent or object of Congress in passing laws to provide hos- pital construction project money. These funds weren't intended for this. It reminds me a little bit of the shellfish toxin situation which turned up when I was on the Church committee. The Public Health Service was used to produce a deadly poison with Public Health money. Here we are using general hospital construction money to carry on a series of drug experiments. Admiral TURNER. Excuse me, sir. If I could just be, I think, ac- curate, I don't think any of this $375,000 or the matching funds were used to conduct drug experiments. They were used to build the hos- pital. Now, the CIA then put more money into a foundation that was conducting research on the CIA's behalf supposedly in that hospital, so the intent was certainly there, but the money was not used for experimentation. Senator SCHWEIKER. Well, I understand it was used for bricks and mortar, but the bricks were used to build the facility where the experi- ments were carried on; were they not? Admiral TURNER. We do not have positive evidence that they were. It certainly would seem that that was the intent, but I do not want to draw inferences here- Senator SCHWEIKER. Well, why else would they give this money for the building fund if the building was not used for a purpose that benefited the CIA program? Admiral TURNER. I certainly draw the inference that the CIA expected to benefit from it, and some of the wording says the General Counsel's opinion was that this was legal only if the CIA was going to derive adequate benefit from it, but, sir, there is no evidence of what benefit was derived. Senator ScHW- EIKER. There must have been some pretty good benefits at stake. The Atomic Energy Commission was to bear a share of the cost, and when they backed out for some reason or another, the CIA picked up part of their tab. So, at two different points there were indications that CIA decisionmakers thought there was great benefit to be derived from whatever happened within the brick and mortar walls of that facility. Admiral TURNER. You are absolutely right. I am only taking the position that I cannot substantiate that there was benefit derived. Senator SCHWEIKER. The agreement documents say that the CIA would have access to one-sixth of the space involved in the construction of the wing, so how would you enter into an agreement that specifically says that you will have access to and use of one-sixth of the space and not perform something in that space? I cannot believe it was empty. Admiral TURNER. Sir, I am not disputing you at all, but both of us are saying that the inference is that one-sixth of the space was used, that experimentation was done, and so on, but there is no factual evi- dence of what went on as a result of that payment or what went on in that hospital. It is just missing. It is not that it didn't happen. Senator SCHTWEIKER. Admiral Turner, one other Senator KENNEDY. Would the Senator yield on that point? Senator SCHWEIKEu. I understand that in the agency's documents on the agreement it was explicitly stated that one-sixth of the facility would be designated for CIA use and made available for CIA re- search. Are you familiar- Mr. BnoDY. Senator, as I recall, you are right in that there is a men- tion of one-sixth, but any mention at all has to do with planning. There are no subsequent reports as to what happened after the construction took place. Senator SCIWKEnR. Admiral Turner, I read in the New York Times that part of this series of MKULTRA experiments involved an ar- rangement with the Federal Bureau of Narcotics to test LSD sur- reptitiously on unwitting patrons in bars in New York and San Francisco. Some of the subjects became violently ill and were hos- pitalized. I wonder if you would just briefly describe what we were doing there and how it was carried out? I assume it was through a safe house operation. I don't believe your statement went into much detail. Admiral TURNER. I did mention the safe house operation in my statement, sir, and that is how these were carried out. What we have learned from the new documentation is the location and the dates at which the safe houses were run by the CIA and the identification of three individuals who were associated with running those safe houses. We know something about the construction work that was done in them because there were contracts for this. Beyond that, we are pretty much drawing inferences as to the things that went on as to what you are saying here. Senator SCHWEIKER. Well, the subjects were unwitting. You can infer that much, right? Admiral TURNER. Right. Senator SCHWEIKER. If you happened to be at the wrong bar at the wrong place and time, you got it. Mr. BRODY. Senator, that would be-contacts were made, as we understand it, in bars, et cetera, and then the people may have been invited to these safe houses. There really isn't any indication as to the fact that this took place in the bars. Admiral TURNER. We are trying to be very precise with you, sir, and not draw an inference here. There are 6 cases of these 149 where we have enough evidence in this new documentation to substantiate that there was unwitting testing and some of that involves these safe houses. There are other cases where it is ambiguous as to whether the testing was witting or voluntary. There are others where it was clearly voluntary. Senator SCHWEIKER. Of course, after a few drinks, it is questionable whether informed consent means anything to a- person in a bar anyway. Admiral TURNER. Well, we don't have any indication that all these cases where it is ambiguous involved drinking of any kind. There are cases in penal institutions where it is not clear whether the prisoner was given a choice or not. I don't know that he wasn't given a choice, but I don't positively know that he was, and I classify that as an ambiguous incident. Senator INoUYE. Your time is up, Senator. Senator Huddleston? Senator HUDDLESTON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Admiral Turner, you stated in your testimony that you are con- vinced there was no attempt to conceal this recently discovered docu- mentation during the earlier searches. Did you question the individ- uals connected with the earlier search before you made that judgment? Admiral TURNER. Yes; I haven't, I don't think, questioned every- body who looked in the files or is still on our payroll who looked in the files back in 1975, but Mr. Laubinger on my left is the best author- ity on this, and I have gone over it with him in some detail. Senator HUDDLESTON. But you have inquired, you think, sufficiently to assure yourself that there was no intent on the part of any person to conceal these records from the previous committee? Admiral TURNER. I am persuaded of that both by my questioning of people and by the circumstances and the way in which these docu- ments were filed, by the fact. which I did not and should have men- tioned in my testimony, that these were not the official files. The ones that we have received or retrieved were copies of files that were work- ing files that somebody had used, and therefore were slipped into a different location, and again I say to you, sir, I can't imagine their deliberately concealing these particular files and revealing the other things that they did reveal in 1975. I don't see the motive for that, because these are not that damning compared with the overall material that was provided. Senator HUDDLESTON. Is this the kind of operation that if it were continuing now or if there were anything similar to it, that you would feel compelled to report to the Select Committee on Intelligence? Admiral TURNER. Yes, sir. You mean, if I discovered that some- thing like this were going on without my knowledge? Yes, I would feel absolutely the requirement to- Senator HUDDLESTON. But if it were going on with your knowledge, would you report it to the committee? I assume you would. Admiral TURNER. Yes. Well, it would not be going on with my knowledge, but theoretically the answer is yes, sir. Senator HUDDLESTON. Well, then, what suggestions would you have as we devise charters for the various intelligence agencies? What provision would you suggest to prohibit this kind of activity from taking place? Would you suggest that it ought to be specifically out- lined in a statutory charter setting out the parameters of the per- missible operation of the various agencies? Admiral TURNER. I think that certainly is something we must con- sider as we look at the legislation for charters. I am not on the face of it opposed to it. I think we would have to look at the particular wording as we are going to have to deal with the whole charter issue as to exactly how precise you want to be in delineating restraints and curbs on the intelligence activities. Senator HUDDLESTON. In the case of sensitive type operations, which this certainly was, which might be going on today, is the oversight activity of the agency more intensive now than it was at that time? Admiral TURNER. Much more so. I mean, I have briefed you, sir, and the committee on our sensitive operations. We have the Intel- ligence Oversight Board. We have a procedure in the National Se- curity Council for approval of very sensitive operations. I think the amount of spotlight focused on these activities is many, manyfold what it was in these 12 to 24 years ago. Senator HUDDLESTON. How about the record keeping? Admiral TURNER. Yes; I can't imagine anyone having the gall to think that he can just blithely destroy records today with all of the attention that has come to this, and certainly we are emphasizing that that is not the case. Senator HUDDLESTON. Admiral, I was particularly interested in the activity that took place at the U.S. Public Health Service Hospital at Lexington, Ky., in which a Dr. Harris Isbell conducted experiments on people who were presumably patients there. There was a narcotics institution, I take it, and Dr. Isbell was, according to the New York Times story, carrying on a secret series of correspondence with an individual at the agency by the name of Ray. Have you identified who that person is? Admiral TURNER. Sir, I find myself in a difficult position here at a public hearing to confirm or deny these names in view of my legal responsibilities under the Privacy Act not to disclose the names of individuals here. Senator HUDDLESTON. I am just. asking you if you have identified the person referred to in that article as Ray. I am not asking you who he was. I just want to know if you know who he is. Admiral TURNER. No. I am sorry, was this W-r-a-y or R-a-y? Senator HUDDLESTON. It is listed in the news article as R-a-y, in quotations. Admiral TURNER. No, sir, we have not identified him. Senator HUDDLESTON. So you have no knowledge of whether or not he is still a member of your staff or connected with the Agency in any way. Have you attempted to identify him? [Pause.] Admiral TURNER. Senator, we have a former employee whose first name is Ray who may have had some connection with these activities. Senator HUDDLESTON. You suspect that but you have not verified that at this time, or at least you are not in a position to indicate that you have verified it? Admiral TURNER. That is correct. Senator HUDDLESTON. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator INOUYE. Senator Wallopi? Senator WALLOP. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Admiral Turner, not all of the-and in no way trying to excuse you of the hideous nature of some of these projects, but not all of the projects under MKULTRA are of a sinister or even a moral nature. Is that a fair statement? Admiral TURNER. That is correct. Senator WALLOP. Looking down through some of these 17 projects not involving human testing, aspects of the magician's art, it doesn't seem as though there is anything very sinister about that. Studies of human behavior and sleep research, library searches. Now, those things in their way are still of interest, are they not, to the process of intelligence gathering? Admiral TURNER. Yes, sir. I have not tried to indicate that we either are not doing or would not do any of the things that were involved in MKULTRA, but when it comes to the witting or unwitting testing of people with drugs, that is certainly verboten, but there are other things. Senator WALLOP. Even with volunteer patients? I mean, I am not trying to put you on the spot to say whether it is going on, but I mean, it is not an uncommon thing, is it, in the prisons of the United States for the Public Health Service to conduct various kinds of experiments with vaccines and, say, sunburn creams? I know in Arizona they have done so. Admiral TURNER. My understanding is, lots of that is authorized. but I am not of the opinion that this is not the CIA's business, and that if we need some information in that category, I would prefer to go to the other a'ppropriate authorities of the Government and ask them to get it for us r-ther than to in any way- Senator WALLOP. Well, you know, you have library searches and at- tendants at the national seminars. This is why I wanted to ask you if the bulk of these projects were in any way the kinds of things that the Agency might not do now. A President would not have been horrified by the list of the legitimate types of things. Isn't that probably the case? Admiral TURNER. Yes, sir. Senator WALLOP. And if it did in fact appear in the IG report, is there any reason to suppose that the President did not know of this project? You said there was no reason to suppose that he did, but let me reverse that. Is there any reason to suppose that they did not? Admiral TURNER. No. Senator WALLOP. Well, you know, I just cannot imagine you or literally anybody undertaking projects of the magnitude of dollars here and just not knowing about it, not informing your superior that these were going on, especially when certain items of it appear in the Inspector General's report on budget matters. Admiral TURNER. Well, I find it difficult when it is that far back to hypothesize what the procedures that the Director was using in terms of informing his superiors were. It is quite a different climate from today, and I think we do a lot more informing today than they did back then, but I find it very difficult to guess what the level of knowl- edge was. Senator WALLOP. I am really not asking you to second-guess it, but it just seems to me that, while the past is past, and thank goodness we are operating under different sets of circumstances, I think it is naive for us to suppose that these things were conducted entirely without the knowledge of the Presidents of the United States during those times. It is just the kinds of research information that was being sought was vital to the United States, not the means, but the information that they were trying to find. Admiral TURNER. I am sorry. Your question is, was this vital? Did we view it as vital? Senator WALLOP. Well, your implication at the beginning was that it was a response to the kinds of behavior that were seen in Cardinal Mindszenty's trial and other things. I mean, somebody must have thought that this was an important defensive reaction, if nothing else, on the part of the United States. Admiral TURNER. Yes, sir, I am sure they did, but again I just don't know how high that -permeated the executive branch. Senator WALLOP. But the kinds of information are still important to you. I mean, I am not suggesting that anyone go back and do that kind of thing again, but I'm certain it would be of use to you to know what was going to -happen to one of your agents assuming someone had put one of these things into his bloodstream, or tried to modify his behavior. Admiral TURNER. Absolutely, and you know, we would be very con- cerned if we thought there were things like truth serums or other things that our agents or others could be subjected to by use or im- proper use of drugs by other powers against our people or agents. Senator WALLOP. Are there? I don't ask you to name them, but are there such serums? Admiral TURNER. I don't know of them if there are. I would have to answer that for the record, sir. Senator WALLOP. I would appreciate that. [The material referred to follows:] "TRUTH" DRUGS IN INTERROGATION The search for effective aids to interrogation is probably as old as man's need to obtain information from an uncooperative source and as persistent as his impatience to shortcut any tortuous path. In the annals of police investigation, physical coercion has at times been substituted for painstaking and time-con- suming inquiry in the belief that direct methods produce quick results. Sir James Stephens, writing in 1883, rationalizes a grisly example of "third degree" prac- tices by the police of India : "It is far pleasanter to sit comfortably in the shade rubbing red pepper in a poor devil's eyes than to go about in the sun hunting up evidence." More recently, police officials in some countries have turned to drugs for assist- ance in extracting confessions from accused persons, drugs which ara esumed 26 to relax the individual's defenses to the point that he unknowingly reveals truthiS he has been trying to conceal. This investigative technique, however humanitarian as an alternative to p~hysical torture, still raises serious questions of individual rights and liberties. In this country, where drugs have gained only marginal acceptance in police work, their use has provoked cries of "psychological third degree" and has precipitated medico-legal controversies that after a quarter of a century still occasionally flare into the open. The use of so-called "truth" drugs in police work is similar to the accepted psychiatric practice of narco-analysis; the difference. in the two procedures lies in their different objectives. The police investigator is concerned with empirical truth that may be used against the suspect, and therefore almost solely with probative truth: the usefulness of the suspect's revelations depends ultimately on their acceptance in evidence by a court of law. The psychiatist, on the other hand, using the same "truth" drugs in diagnosis and treatment of the mentally ill, is primarily concerned with psychological truth or psychological reality rather than empirical fact. A patient's aberrations are reality for him at the time they occur, and an accurate account of these fantasies and delusions, rather than reliable recollection of past events, can be the key to recovery. The notion of drugs capable of illuminating hidden recesses of the mind, help- ing to heal the mentally ill and preventing or reversing the miscarriage of justice, has provided an exceedingly durable theme for the press and popular literature. While acknowledging that "truth serum" is a misnomer twice over-the drugs are not sera and they do not necessarily bring forth probative truth-journalistic accounts continue to exploit the appeal of the term. The formula is to play up a few spectacular "truth" drug successess and to imply that the drugs are more maligned than need be and more widely employed in criminal investigation than can officially be admitted. Any technique that promises an increment of success in extracting information from an uncompliant source is ipso facto of interest in intelligence operations. If the ethical considerations which in Western countries inhibit the use of narco- interrogation in police work are felt also in intelligence, the Western services must at least be prepared against its possible employment by the adversary. An understanding of "truth" drugs, their characteristic actions, and their potentiali- ties, positive and negative, for eliciting useful information is fundamental to an adequate defense against them. This discussion, meant to help toward such an understanding, draws primarily upon openly published materials. It has the limitations of projecting from crimi- nal investigative practices and from the permissive atmosphere of drug psycho- therapy. SCOPOLAMINE AS "TRUTH SERUM" Early in this century physicians began to employ scopolamine, along with morphine and chloroform, to induce a state of "twilight sleep" during childbirth. A constituent of henbane, scopolamine was known to produce sedation and drowsi- ness, confusion and disorientation, incoordination, and amnesia for events ex- perienced during intoxication. Yet physicians noted that women in twilight sleep answered questions accurately and often volunteered exceedingly candid remarks. In 1922 it occurred to Robert House, a Dallas, Texas obstetrician, that a similar technique might be employed in the interrogation of suspected criminals, and he arranged to interview under scopolamine two. prisoners in the Dallas county jail whose guilt seemed clearly confirmed. Under the drug, both men denied the charges on which they were held; and both, upon trial, were found not guilty. Enthusiastic at this success, House concluded that a patient under the influence of scopolamine "cannot create a lie . . . and there is no power to think or rea- son." [14] His experiment and this conclusion attracted wide attention, and the idea of a "truth" drug was thus launched upon the public consciousness. The phrase "truth serum" is believed to have appeared first in a news -report of House's experiment in the Los Angeles Record, sometime in 1922. House resisted the term for a while but eventually came to employ it regularly himself. He pub- lished some eleven articles on scopolamine in the years 1921-1929, with a notice- able increase in polemical zeal as time went on. What had begun as something of a scientific statement turned finally into a dedicated crusade by the "father of truth serum" on behalf of his offspring, wherein he was "grossly indulgent of its wayward behavior and stubbornly proud of its minor achievements." [11] Only a handful of cases in which scopolamine was used for police interroga- tion came to public notice, though there is evidence suggesting that some police forces may have used it extensively. [2, 16] One police writer claims that the threat of scopolamine interrogation has been effective in extracting confessions from criminal suspects, who are told they will first be rendered unconscious by chloral hydrate placed covertly in their coffee or drinking water.[16] Because of a number of undesirable side effects, scopolamine was shortly dis- qualified as a "truth" drug. Among the most disabling of the side effects are hallucinations, disturbed perception, somnolence, and physiological phenomena such as headache, rapid heart, and blurred vision, which distract the subject from the central purpose of the interview. Furthermore, the physical action is long, far outlasting the psychological effects. Scopolamine continues, in some cases, to make anesthesia and surgery safer by drying the mouth and throat and reducing secre- tions that might obstruct the air passages. But the fantastically, almost painfully, dry "desert" mouth brought on by the drug is hardly conducive to free talking, even in a tractable subject. THE BARBITURATES The first suggestion that drugs might facilitate communication with emo- tionally disturbed patients came quite by accident in 1916. Arthur S. Lovenhart and his associates at the University of Wisconsin, experimenting with respiratory stimulants, were surprised when, after an injection of sodium cyanide, a catatonic patient who had long been mute and rigid suddenly relaxed, opened his eyes, and even answered a few questions. By the early 1930's a number of psychiatrists were experimenting with drugs as an adjunct to established methods of therapy. At about this time police officials, still attracted by the possibility that drugs migh help in the interrogation of suspects and witnesses, turned to a class of depressant drugs known as the barbiturates. By 1935 Clarence W. Muehlberger, head of the Michigan Crime Detection Laboratory at East Lansing, Was using barbiturates on reluctant suspects, though police work continued to be hampered by the courts' rejection of drug-induced confessions except in a few carefully circumscribed instances. The barbiturates, first synthesized in 1903, are among the oldest of modern drugs and the most versatile of all depressants. In this half-century some 2,500 have been prepared, and about two dozen of these have won an important place in medicine. An estimated three to four billion doses of barbiturates are pre- scribed by physicians in the United States each year, and they have come to be known by a variety of commercial names and colorful slang expressions: "goof- balls," Luminal, Nembutal, "red devils." "yellow jackets." "pink ladies," etc. Three of them which are used in narcoanalysis and have seen service as "truth" drugs are sodium amytal (amobarbital), pentothal sodium (thiopental), and to a lesser extent seconal (secobarbital). As one pharmacologist explains it, a subject coming under the Influence of a barbiturate injected intravenously goes through all the stages of progressive drunkenness, but the time scale is on the order of minutes instead of hours. Outwardly the sedation effect is dramatic, especially if the subject is a psychiatric patient in tension. His features slacken, his body relaxes. Some people are momentarily excited; a few beocme silly and giggly. This usually passes, and most subjects fall asleep, emerging later in disoriented semi-wakefulness. The descent into narcosis and beyond with progressively larger doses can be divided as follows: I. Sedative stage. II. Unconsciousness, with exaggerated reflexes (hyperactive stage). III. Unconsciousness, without reflex even to painful stimuli. IV. Death. Whether all these stages can be distinguished in any given subject depends largely on the dose and the rapidity with which the drug is induced. In anesthesia, stages I and II may last only two or three seconds. The first or sedative stage can be further divided: Plane 1. No evident effect, or slight sedative effect. Plane 2. Cloudiness, calmness, amnesia. (Upon recovery, the subject will not remember what happened at this or "lower" planes or stages.) Plane 3. Slurred speech, old thought patterns disrupted, inability to inte- grate or learn new patterns. Poor coordination. Subject becomes unaware of paniful stimuli. Plane 3 is the psychiatric "work" stage. It may last only a few minutes, but it can be extended by further slow injection of drug. The usual practice is to bring the subject quickly to Stage II and to conduct the interview as he passes back into the sedative stage on the way to full consciousness. CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES The general abhorrence in Western countries for the use of chemical agents "to make people do things against their will" has precluded serious systematic study (at least as published openly) of the potentialities of drugs for interroga- tion. Louis A. Gottschalk, surveying their use in information-seeking inter- views, [13] cites 136 references; but only two touch upon the extraction of Intelligence information, and one of these concludes merely that Russian tech- niques in interrogation and indoctrination are derived from age-old police methods and do not depend on the use of drugs. On the validity of confessions obtained with drugs, Gottschalk found only three published experimental studies .that he deemed worth reporting. One of these reported experiments by D. P. Morris in which intravenous sodium amytal was helpful in detecting malingerers. [12] The subjects, soldiers, were at first sullen,.negativistic, and non-productive under amytal, but as the inter- view proceeded they revealed the fact of and causes for their malingering. Usually the interviews turned up a neurotic or psychotic basis for the deception. The other two confession studies, being more relevant to the highly special- ized, untouched area of drugs in intelligence interrogation, deserve more detailed review. Gerson and Victoroff [12] conducted amytal interviews with 17 neuropsychiatric patients, soldiers who had charges against them, at Tilton General Hospital, Fort Dix. First they were interviewed without amytal by a psychiatrist, who, neither ignoring nor stressing their situation as prisoners or suspects under scrutiny, urged each of them to discuss his social and family background, his army career, and his version of the charges pending against him. The patients were told only a few minutes in advance that narcoanalysis would be performed. The doctor was considerate, but positive and forthright. He indi- cated that they had no choice but to submit to the procedure. Their attitudes varied from unquestioning compliance to downright refusal. Each patient was brought to complete narcosis and permitted to sleep. As he became semiconscious and could be stimulated to speak, he was held in this stage with additional amytal while the questioning proceeded. He was questioned first about innocuous matters from his background that he had discussed before receiving the drug. Whenever possible, he was manipulated into bringing up himself the charges pending against him before being questioned about them. If he did this in a too fully conscious state, it proved more effective to ask him to "talk about that later" and to interpose a topic that would diminish suspicion, delaying the interrogation on his criminal activity until he was back in the proper stage of narcosis. The procedure differed from therapeutic narcoanalysis in several ways: the setting, the type of patients, and the kind of "truth" sought. Also, the subjects were kept in twilight consciousness longer than usual. This state proved richest in yield of admissions prejudicial to the subject. In it his speech was thick, mumbling, and disconnected, but his discretion was markedly reduced. This val- uable interrogation period, lasting only five to ten minutes at a time, could be reinduced by injecting more amytal and putting the patient back to sleep. The interrogation technique varied from case to case according to background information about the patient, the seriousness of the charges, the patient's atti- tude under narcosis, and his rapport with the doctor. Sometimes it was useful to pretend, as the patient grew more fully conscious, that he had already confessed during the amnestic period of the interrogation, and to urge him, while his mem- ory and sense of self-protection were still limited, to continue to elaborate the details of what he had "already described." When it was obvious that a subject was withholding the truth, his denials were quickly passed over and ignored, and the key questions would be reworded in a new approach. Several patients revealed fantasies, fears, and delusions approaching delirium, much of which could readily be distinguished from reality. But sometimes there was no way for the examiner to distinguish truth from fantasy except by refer- ence to other sources. One subject claimed to have a child that did not exist, 29 another threatened to kill on sight a stepfather who had been dead a year, and yet another confessed to participating in a robbery when in fact he had only purchased goods from the participants. Testimony concerning dates and specific places was untrustworthy and often contradictory because of the patient's loss of time-sense. His veracity in citing names and events proved questionable. Be- cause of his confusion about actual events and what he thought or feared had happened, the patient at times managed to conceal the truth unintentionally. As the subject revived, he would become aware that he was being questioned about his secrets and, depending upon his personality, his fear of discovery, or the degree of his disillusionment with the doctor, grow negativistic, hostile, or physically aggressive. Occasionally patients had to be forcibly restrained during this period to prevent injury to themselves or others as the doctor continued to interrogate. Some patients, moved by fierce and diffuse anger, the assumption that they had already been tricked into confessing, and a still limited sense of discretion, defiantly acknowledged their guilt and challenged the observer to "do something about it." As the excitement passed, some fell back on their orig- inal stories and others verified the confessed material. During the follow-up interview nine of the 17 admitted the validity of their confessions; eight re- pudiated their confessions and reaffirmed their earlier accounts. With respect to the reliability of the results of such interrogation, Gerson and Victoroff conclude that persistent, careful questioning can reduce ambigui- ties in drug interrogation, but cannot eliminate them altogether. At least one experiment has shown that subjects are capable of maintaining a lie while under the influence of a barbiturate. Redlich and his associates at Yale[25] administered sodium amytal to nine volunteers, students and profes- sionals, who had previously, for purposes of the experiment, revealed shameful and guilt-producing episodes of their past and then invented false self-protective stories to cover them. In nearly every case the cover story retained some ele- ments of the guilt inherent in the true story. Under the influence of the drug, the subjects were crossexamined on their cover stories by a second investigator. The results, though not definitive, showed that normal individuals who had good defenses and no overt pathological traits could stick to their invented stories and refuse confession. Neurotic individuals with strong unconscious self-punitive tendencies, on the other hand, both con- fessed more easily and were inclined to substitute fantasy for the truth, con- fessing to offenses never actually committed. In recent years drug therapy has made some use of stimulants, most notably amphetamine (Benzedrine) and its relative methamphetamine (Methedrine). These drugs, used either alone or following intravenous barbiturates, produce an outpouring of ideas, emotions, and memories which has been of help in diag- nosing mental disorders. The potential of stimulants in interrogation has re- ceived little attention, unless in unpublished work. In one study of their psychi- atric use Brussel et al. [7] maintain that methedrine gives the liar no time to think or to organize his deceptions. Once the drug takes hold, they say, an in- surmountable urge to pour out speech traps the malingerer. Gottschalk, on the other hand, says that this claim is extravagant, asserting without elabora- tion that the study lacked proper controls. [13] It is evident that the combined use of barbiturates and stimulants, perhaps along with ataraxics (tranquilizers), should be further explored. OBSERVATIONS FROM PRACTICE J. M. MacDonald, who as a psychiatrist for the District Courts of Denver has had extensive experience with narcoanalysis, says that drug interrogation is of doubtful value in obtaining confessions to crimes. Criminal suspects under the influence of barbiturates may deliberately withhold information, persist in giving untruthful answers, or falsely confess to crimes they did not commit. The psychopathic personality, in particular, appears to resist successfully the influence of drugs. MacDonald tells of a criminal psychopath who, having agreed to narco-inter- rogation, received 1.5 grams of sodium amytal over a period of five hours. This man feigned amnesia and gave a false account of a murder. "He displayed little or no remorse as he (falsely) described the crime, including burial of the body. Indeed he was very self-possessed and he appeared almost to enjoy the examina- tion. From time to time he would request that more amytal be injected."[211 MacDonald concludes that a person who gives false information prior to re- 96-408 0 - 77 - 3 30 ceiving drugs is likely to give false information also under narcosis, that the drugs are of little value for revealing deceptions, and that they are more effective in releasing unconsciously repressed material than in evoking consciously sup- pressed information. Another psychiatrist known for his work with criminals, L. Z. Freedman, gave sodium amytal to men accused of various civil and military antisocial acts. The subjects were mentally unstable, their conditions ranging from character disorders to neuroses and psychoses. The drug interviews proved psychiatrically beneficial to the patients, but Freedman found that his view of objective reality was seldom improved by their revelations. He was unable to say on the basis of the narco-interrogation whether a given act had or had not occurred. Like Mac- Donald, he found that psychopathic individuals can deny to the point of uncon- sciousness crimes that every objective sign indicates they have committed.[10] F. G. Inbau, Professor of Law at Northwestern University, who has had con- siderable experience observing and participating in "truth" drug tests, claims that they are occasionally effective on persons who would have disclosed the truth anyway had they been properly interrogated, but that a person deter- mined to lie will usually be able to continue the deception under drugs. The two military psychiatrists who made the most extensive use of narcoanal- ysis during the war years, Roy R. Grinker and John C. Spiegel, concluded that in almost all cases they could obtain from their patients essentially the same material and give them the same emotional release by therapy without the use of drugs, provided they had sufficient time. The essence of these comments from professionals of long experience is that drugs provide rapid access to information that is psychiatrically useful but of doubtful validity as empirical truth. The same psychological information and a less adulterated empirical truth can be obtained from fully conscious subjects through non-drug psychotherapy and skillful police interrogation. APPLICATION TO CI INTERROGATION The almost total absence of controlled experimental studies of "truth" drugs and the spotty and anecdotal nature of psychiatric and police evidence require that extrapolations to intelligence operations be made with care. Still, enough is known about the drugs' action to suggest certain considerations affecting the possibilities for their use in interrogations. It should be clear from the foregoing that at best a drug can only serve as an aid to an interrogator who has a sure understanding of the psychology and techniques of normal interrogation. In some respects, indeed, the demands on his skill will be increased by the baffling mixture of truth and fantasy in drug-induced output. And the tendency against which he must guard in the interrogate to give the responses that seem to be wanted without regard for facts will be heightened by drugs: the literature abounds with warnings that a subject in narcosis is extremely suggestible. It seems possible that this suggestibility and the lowered guard of the narcotic state might be put to advantage in the case of a subject feigning ignorance of a language or some other skill that had become automatic with him. Lipton[20] found sodium amytal helpful in determining whether a foreign subject was merely pretending not to understand English. By extension, one can guess that a drugged interrogatee might have difficulty maintaining the pretense that he did not com- prehend the idiom of a profession he was trying to hide. There is the further problem of hostility in the interrogator's relationship to a resistance source. The accumulated knowledege about "truth" drug reaction has come largely from patient-physician relationships of trust and confidence. The subject in narcoanalysis is usually motivated a priori to cooperate with the psychiatrist, either to obtain relief from mental suffering or to contribute to a scientific study. Even in police work, where an atmosphere of anxiety and threat may be dominant, a relationship of trust frequently asserts itself: the drug is administered by a medical man bound by a strict code of ethics; the suspect agreeing to undergo narcoanalysis in a desperate bid for corroboration of his testimony trusts both drug and psychiatrist, however apprehensively; and finally, as Freedman and MacDonald have indicated, the police psychiatrist frequently deals with a "sick" criminal, and some order of patient-physician relationship necessarily evolves. Rarely has a drug interrogation involved "normal" individuals in a hostile or genuinely threatening milieu. It was from a non-threatening experimental setting that Eric Lindemann could say that his "normal" subjects "reported a general sense of euphoria, ease and confidence, and they exhibited a marked in- crease in talkativeness and conimunicability."[18] Gerson and Victoroff list poor doctor-patient rapport as one factor interfering with the completeness and au- thenticity of confessions by the Fort Dix soldiers, caught as they were in a command performance and told they had no choice but to submit to narco- interrogation. From all indications, subject-interrogator rapport is usually crucial to obtain- ing the psychological release which may lead to unguarded disclosures. Role-play- ing on the part of the interrogator might be a possible solution to the problem of establishing rapport with a drugged subject. In therapy, the British narco- analyst William Sargent recommends that the therapist deliberately distort the facts of the patient's life-experience to achieve heightened emotional response and abreaction.[27] In the drunken state of narcoanalysis patients are prone to accept the therapist's false constructions. There is reason to expect that a drugged subject would communicate freely with an interrogator playing the role of rela- tive, colleague, physician, immediate superior, or any other person to whom his background indicated he would be responsive. Even when rapport is poor, however, there remains one facet of drug action eminently exploitable in interrogation-the fact that subjects emerge from narcosis feeling they have revealed a great deal, even when they have not. As Gerson and Victoroff demonstrated 'at Fort Dix, this psychological set provides a major opening for obtaining genuine confessions. POSSIBLE VARIATIONS In studies by Beecher and his associates, [3-6] one-third to one-half the individuals tested proved to be placebo reactors, subjects who respond with symptomatic relief to the administration of any syringe, pill, or capsule, regard- less of what it contains. Although no studies are known to have been made of the placebo phenomenon as applied to narco-interrogation, it seems reasonable that when a subject's sense of guilt interferes with productive interrogation, a placebo for pseudo-narcosis could have the effect of absolving him of the responsibility for his acts and thus clear the way for free communication. It is notable that placebos are most likely to be effective in situations of stress. The individuals most likely to react to placebos are the more anxious, more self-centered, more dependent on outside stimulation, those who express their needs more freely socially, talkers who drain off anxiety by conversing with others. The non- reactors are those clinically more rigid and with better than average emotional control. No sex or I.Q. differences between reactors and non-reactors have been found. Another possibility might be the combined use of drugs with hypnotic trance and post-hypnotic suggestion: hypnosis could presumably prevent any recollec- tion of the drug experience. Whether a subject can be brought to trance against his will or unaware, however, is a matter of some disagreement. Orne, in a survey of the potential uses of hypnosis in interrogation,[23] asserts that it is doubt- ful, despite many apparent indications to the contrary, that trance can be induced in resistant subjects. It may be possible, he adds, to hypnotize a subject unaware, but this would require a positive relationship with the hypnotist not likely to be found in the interrogation setting. In medical hypnosis, pentothal sodium is sometimes employed when only light trance has been induced and deeper narcosis is desired. This procedure is a possibility for interrogation, but if a satisfactory level of narcosis could be achieved through hypnotic trance there would appear to be no need for drugs. DEFENSIVE MEASURES There is no known way of building tolerance for a "truth" drug without creat- ing a disabling addiction, or of arresting the action of a barbiturate once induced. The only full safeguard against narco-interrogation is to prevent the adminis- tration of the drug. Short of this, the best defense is to make use of the same knowledge that suggests drugs for offensive operations: if a subject knows that on emerging from narcosis he will have an exaggerated notion of how much he has revealed he can better resolve to deny he has said anything. 32 The disadvantages and shortcomings of drugs in offensive operations become positive features of the defense posture. A subject in narco-interrogation is intoxicated, wavering between deep sleep and semi-wakefulness. His speech is garbled and irrational, the amount of output drastically diminished. Drugs disrupt established thought patterns, including the will to resist, but they do so indiscriminately and thus also interfere with the patterns of substantive infor- mation the interrogator seeks. Even under the conditions most favorable for the interrogator, output will be contaminated by fantasy, distortion, and untruth. Possibly the most effective way to arm oneself against narco-interrogation would be to undergo a "dry run." A trial drug interrogation with output taped for playback would familiarize an individual with his own reactions to "truth" drugs, and this familiarity would help to reduce the effects of harassment by the interrogator before and after the drug has been administered. From the view- point of the intelligence service, the trial exposure of a particular operative to drugs might provide a rough benchmark for assessing the kind and amount of information he would divulge in narcosis. There may be concern over the possibility of drug addiction intentionally or accidentally induced by an adversary service. Most drugs will cause addiction with prolonged use, and the barbiturates are no exception. In recent studies at the U.S. Public Health Service Hospital for addicts in Lexington, Ky., subjects received large doses of barbiturates over a period of months. Upon removal of the drug, they experienced acute withdrawal symptoms and behaved in every respect like chronic alcoholics. Because their action is extremely short, however, and because there is little likelihood that they would be administered regularly over a prolonged period, barbiturate "truth" drugs present slight risk of operational addiction. If the adversary service were intent on creating addiction in order to exploit with- drawal, it would have other, more rapid.means of producing states as unpleasant as withdrawal symptoms. The hallucinatory and psychotomimetic drugs such as mescaline, marihuana, LSD-25, and microtine are sometimes mistakenly associated with narcoanalytic interrogation. These drugs distort the perception and interpretation of the sen- sory input to the central nervous system and affect vision, audition, smell, the sensation of the size of body parts and their position in space, etc. Mescaline and LSD-25 have been used to create experimental "psychotic states," and in a minor way as aids in psychotherapy. Since information obtained from a person in a psychotic drug state would be unrealistic, bizarre, and extremely difficult to assess, the self-administration of LSD-25, which is effective in minute dosages, might in special circumstances offer an operative temporary protection against interrogation. Conceivably, on the other hand, an adversary service could use such drugs to produce anxiety or terror in medically unsophisticated subjects unable to distinguish drug-induced psychosis from actual insanity. An enlightened operative could not be thus frightened, however, knowing that the effect of these hallucinogenic agents is transient in normal individuals. Most broadly, there is evidence that drugs have least effect on well-adjusted individuals with good defenses and good emotional control, and that anyone who can withstand the stress of competent interrogation in the waking state can do so in narcosis. The essential resources for resistance thus appear to lie within the individual. CONCLUSIONS The salient points that emerge from this discussion are the following. No such magic brew as the popular notion of truth serum exists. The barbiturates, by disrupting defensive patterns, may sometimes be helpful in interrogation, but even under the best conditions they will elicit an output contaminated by decep- tion, fantasy, garbled speech, etc. A major vulnerability they produce in the sub- ject is a tendency to believe he has revealed more than he has. It is possible, how- ever, for both normal individuals and psychopaths to resist drug interrogation; it seems likely that any individual who can withstand ordinary intensive inter- rogation can hold out in narcosis. The best aid to a defense against narco-inter- rogation is foreknowledge of the process and its limitations. There is an acute need for controlled experimental studies of drug reaction, not only to depressants but also to stimulants and to combinations of depressants, stimulants, and ataraxics. 33 REFERENCES 1.

If they are, I would assume that you would still try to find from either theirs or somebody else's information how to protect our people from that kind of activity. Admiral TURNER. Yes. Senator WALLOP. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator INOUYE. Senator Chafee? Senator CHAFEE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Admiral Turner, I appreciate that these tawdry activities were tak- ing place long before your watch, and I think you have correctly labeled them as abhorrent, 'but not only were they abhorrent, it seems to me they were rather bungled, amateurish experiments that don't seem to have been handled in a very scientific way, at least from the scanty evidence we have. It seems to me that there were the minimum of reports and the Agency didn't have the ability to call it quits. It went on for some 12 years, as you mentioned. What I would like to get to is, are you con- vinced now in your Agency that those scientific experiments, legiti- mate ones that you were conducting with polygraph and so forth, were being conducted in a scientific manner and that you are handling it in a correct manner to get the best information that you are seeking in the end? Admiral TURNER. Yes, I am, and I also have a sense of confidence that we are limiting ourselves to the areas where we need to be in- volved as opposed to areas where we can rely on others. Senator CHAFEE. I am convinced of that from your report. I just do hope that you have people who are trained in not only handling this type of experiment, but in preparing the proper reports and drawing the proper data from the reports. You are convinced that you have this type of people? Admiral TURNER. Yes, sir. Senator CHAFEE. The second point I am interested in was the final lines in your testimony here, which I believe are very important, and that is that the Agency is doing all it can in cooperation with other branches of the Government to go about tracking down the identity of those who were in some way adversely affected, and see what can be done to fulfill the government's responsibilities in that respect. I might add that I commend you in that, and I hope you will pursue it vigorously. A hospital in my State was involved in these proceedings, and it is unclear exactly what did take place, so I have both a parochial interest in this and a national interest as well, and I do hope you will press on with it. It involves not only you, I appreciate, but also HEW and per- haps the Attorney General. Admiral TURNER. Thank you, sir. We will. Senator CHAFEE. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator INOUYE. Thank you very much. Admiral Turner, MKULTRA subproject 3 was a project involving the surreptitious administration of LSD on unwitting persons,.was it not? Admiral TURNER. Yes, sir. Senator INOUYE. In February 1954, and this was in the very early stages of MAKULTRA, the Director of Central Intelligence wrote to the technical services staff officials criticizing their judgment because they had participated in an experiment involving the administration of LSD on an unwitting basis to Dr. Frank Olson, who later committed suicide. Now, the individuals criticized were the same individuals who were responsible for this subproject 3, involving exactly the same prac- tices. Even though these individuals were clearly aware of the dangers of surreptitious administration and had been criticized by the Director of Central Intelligence, subproject 3 was not terminated immediately after Dr. Olson's death. In fact. according to documents, it continued for a number of years. Can you provide this committee with any explanation of how such testing could have continued under these circumstances? Admiral TURNER. No, sir, I really can't. Senator INOUYE. Are the individuals in the technical services who carried on subproject 3 still on the CIA payroll? Admiral TURNER. I am sorry. Are you asking, are they today? Senator INOUYE. Yes. Admiral TURNER. No, sir. Senator INOUYE. What would you do if you criticized officials of the technical services staff and they continued to carry on experimenta- tion for a number of years? Admiral TURNER. I would do two things, sir. One is, I would be sure at the beginning that I was explicit enough that they knew that I didn't want that to be continued anywhere else, and two, if I found it being continued, I would roll some heads. Senator INOUYE. Could you provide this committee with informa- tion as to whether the individuals involved had their heads rolled? Admiral TURNER. I don't believe there is any evidence they did, but I will double check that. [See p. 170 for material referred to.] Senator INOUYE. As you know, Senator Huddleston and his subcom- mittee are deeply involved in the drafting of charters and guidelines for the intelligence community. We will be meeting with the President tomorrow. Our concern is, I think, a basic one. Can anything like this occur again? Admiral TURNER. I think it would be very, very unlikely, first, be- cause we are all much more conscious of these issues than we were back in the fifties, second, because we have such thorough oversight proce- dures. I cannot imagine that this kind of activity could take place today without some member of the CIA itself bypassing me, if I were authorizing this, and writing to the Intelligence Oversight Board, and blowing the whistle on this kind of activity. I am also doing my very best, sir, to encourage an openness with myself and a free communication in the Agency, so that I am the one who finds these things if they should happen. The fact is that we must keep you and your committee and now the new committee in the House informed of our sensitive activities. I think all of these add up to a degree of scrutiny such that this kind of extensive and flagrant activity could not happen today without it coming to the attention of the proper authorities to stop it. Senator INOUYE. A sad aspect of the MKULTRA project was that it naturally involved the people who unwittingly or wittingly got in- volved in experimentation. I would appreciate it if you would report back to this committee in 3 months on what the Agency has done to notify these individuals and these institutions, and furthermore, to notify us as to what steps have been taken to identify victims, and if identified, what you have done to assist them, monetarily or otherwise. Admiral TURNER. All right, sir. I will be happy to. Senator GOLDWATER. Will the Senator yield? Senator INoUYE. Yes, Sir. Senator GOLDWATER. I wonder if he could include in that report for our information only a complete listing of the individuals and the experiments done on them, and whether they were'witting or unwitting, volunteer or nonvolunteer, and what has been the result in each case. I think that would be interesting. Admiral TURNER. Fine. Yes, Sir. Senator INOUYE. Senator Kennedy? Senator KENNEDY. Thank you. It is your intention to notify the in- dividuals who have been the subjects of the research, is that right, Admiral Turner? Do you intend to notify those individuals? Admiral TURNER. Yes. Senator KENNEDY. If you can identify them, you intend to notify them? Admiral TURNER. Yes. Senator KENNEDY. And you intend to notify the universities or re- search centers as well? Admiral TURNER. Senator, I am torn on that. I understand your opening statement. I put myself in the position of the president of one of those universities, let's say. If he were witting-if his university had been witting of this activity with us, he has access to all that in- formation today. If he were not witting, I wonder if the process of informing him might put his institution's reputation in more jeopardy than letting them go on the way they are today, not knowing. I really don't know the equities here. Senator KENNEDY. Well, the problem is, all you have to do is pick up the newspapers and you see these universities mentioned. In many in- stances, I think you are putting the university people at an extraordi- nary disadvantage, where there is a complete change of administra- tion, and they may for one reason or another not have information that they are under suspicion. There is innuendo; there is rumor. I cannot help but believe that it will just get smeared all over the news- papers in spite of all the security steps that have been taken. It seems to me that those universities should be entitled to that infor- mation, so that the ones with other administrations can adapt proce- dures to protect those universities. The importance of preserving the independence of our research areas and the communities seems to me to be a very fundamental kind of question about the protection of the integrity of our universities and our research centers. Admiral TURNER. You are saying that you feel that if we identify them privately to themselves, we can benefit them in an adequate way to cover the risk that this will lead to a more public disclosure? There are lots of the 80 who have not been identified publicly at this point. Senator KENNEDY. I think the universities themselves should be noti- fied. I think then the universities can take whatever steps in terms of their setting up the procedures to protect their own kinds of integrity in terms of the future. I would certainly hope that they would feel that they could make a public comment or a public statement on it. I think it is of general public interest, particularly for the people that are involved in those universities, to have some kind of awareness of whether they were used or were not used and how they were used. I think they are entitled to it, and quite frankly, if there is a public official or an official of the university that you notify and he wants for his own particular reasons not to have it public, I don't see why those in a lesser echelon or lower echelon who have been effectively used by it should not have the information as well. So, I would hopethat you would notify the universities and then also indicate to the public. I can't conceive that this information will not be put out in the newspapers, and it puts the university people at an extraordinary disadvantage, and of course some of it is wrong, which is the fact of the matter, and I think some university official saying, well, it isn't so, is a lot different than if they know it is con- firmed or it is not confirmed in terms of the Agency itself. I think that there is a responsibility there. Admiral TURNER. I have great sympathy with what you are saying. I have already notified one institution because the involvement was so extensive that I thought they really needed to protect themselves, and I am most anxious to do this in whatever way will help all of the people who were perhaps unwitting participants in this, and the diffi- culty I will have is, I can't quite do, I think, what you suggested, in that I may not be able to tell an institution of the extent and nature of its participation. Senator KENNEDY. Well, you can tell them to the best of your in- formation, and it seems to me that just because the university or an individual is going to be embarrassed is not a reason for classifying the information. So, I would hope-I mean, I obviously speak as an individual Senator, but I feel that that is an incredible disservice to the innocent individuals and, I think, a disservice to the integrity of the universities unless they are notified, to be able to develop pro- cedures you are developing with regards to your own institution and we are trying to in terms of the Congress. Certainly the universities are entitled to the same. Admiral TURNER. Yes. Not all of these, of course, were unwitting. Senator KENNEDY. That's right. Admiral TURNER. Many of them were witting, and therefore they can take all those precautionary steps on their own, but I am perfectly open to doing this. I am only interested in doing it in a way that when identifying a university it will not lead to the public disclosure of the individuals, whom I am not allowed to disclose, and so on. Senator KENNEDY. That could be done, it seems to me. Admiral TURNER. So, we will see if we can devise a way of notifying these institutions on a private basis so that they can then make their own decision whether their equities are best served by their announc- ing it publicly or their attempting to maintain it- Senator KENNEDY. Or you. I wonder. What if they were to ask you to announce or indicate ? Admiral TURNER. My personal conscience, sir, at this time, is that I would be doing a disserve to these universities if I notified the public. Senator KENNEDY. Would you meet with some university officials and ask what their views are or whether they feel that the preserva- tion of the integrity of the universities would be better served or not? I think that would be useful to find out from small, large, private, and public universities' officials how they view the integrity Admiral TURNER. Fine. I will phone several university presidents today who are my friends and who are not involved in this, and ask them what they think the equities would be. Senator KENNEDY. All right. You let us know, too. Admiral TURNER. But I am not sure that I see that there is any great benefit in my notifying the public as opposed to the university notify- ing them. Let him have his choice whether he wants-each institution wants to have it made public. Senator KENNEDY. Yes. The fact would remain that the institution's credibility would be better served if the institution's president were to deny it and the university indicated that it did not participate in that program than if the university were to deny it and the Agency says nothing. It seems to me that that would be the strongest, and the only way that that is going to be credible. I would value it if you would get some input from universities as to what they believe is the fairest way in terms of the preservation of the integrity of the universities. Let me, if I could, ask on the question of the uses of these safe houses, as I understand from information that was provided to us in the course of our last committee, the testing of various drugs on in- dividuals happened at all social levels, high and low, it happened on native Americans and also on foreign nationals. That is what I under- stand was the nature of the project itself. Now, I am just wondering whether those tests were conducted at the two locations on the east coast and the west coast which were known as safe houses. To your knowledge, is that correct? Admiral TURNER. Yes. Senator KENNEDY. In terms of the research in this particular pro- gram, it did not go beyond the safe houses located on the east coast and the west coast? I believe I am correct on that. Admiral TURNER. That type of unwitting testing of sort of ran- domly selected individuals, yes. Senator KENNEDY. It was just located in those two places? Admiral TURNER. To the best of our knowledge, there were only two locations. Senator KENNEDY. Well, how do we interpret randomly selected? Admiral TURNER. Well, as opposed to prisoners in a prison who were somehow selected. Senator KENNEDY. All right. Do you know from this information how many people were recruited during this period? Admiral TURNER. No idea. Senator KENNEDY. Do you know approximately? Admiral TURNER. I asked that question the other day, and we just don't have-apparently we are very-well, either there were no records kept of the actual numbers and types of people tested or they were destroyed. Senator INOUYE. Senator Schweiker. Senator SCmWEKER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Admiral Turner, I would like to come back to the experiments which may have been conducted at the hospital research facilities which the CIA helped to finance. It wasn't clear to me from your pre- vious answers what kind of work was done there. I gather you are un- clear on that, too, from your remarks, yet I find in the CIA docu- mentation which you have supplied us, a list describing some of the advantages the Agency hoped to gain. It says: (a) One-sixth of the total space in the new hospital wing will be available to the Chemical Division of TSS * * * ; (b) Agency sponsorship of sensitive research projects will be completely deniable; (c) Full professional cover will be provided for up to three biochemical employees of the Chemical Division; (4) Human patients and volunteers for experimental use will be available under controlled clinical conditions with the full supervision of and there is a blank, something has been deleted. It seems pretty clear to me what they intended to do in that par- ticular wing. Doesn't it to you? Why would you go to such elaborate preparations, to buy part of the wing, bring three of your own per- sonnel there, give them a cover, and give them access to patients? Why would you go to such trouble and expense to arrange all that, if you weren't planning to experiment on people in the hospital? Admiral TURNER. I agree with you 100 percent, sir. Those were clearly the intentions. I have no evidence that it was carried out in that way. I am not trying to be defensive, Senator. I am only trying to be absolutely precise here. Senator SCHWEIKER. Well, then, as to the nature of what was done there, the last paragraph on the same page of the document says, "The facilities of the hospital and the. ability to conduct controlled experimentations under safe clinical conditions using materials with which any agency connection must be completely deniable will aug- ment and complement other programs recently taken over by TSS, such as," and then there's another deletion. Now, the words following "such as" have been deleted. That is still classified, or at least it was removed when this document was sanitized and released. It seems to be that whatever was deleted right there would give you a pretty good clue as to what they were doing, since it says that the activities would "augment and complement other -programs" undertaken by TSS. So, I have trouble understanding why you don't know what was contemplated. Just the fact.that similar programs are referred to in the document, though what they are is still deleted, should enable you to check it out. You could look at what went on in the similar programs mentioned following the "such as" in the classified version of this document. Admiral TURNER. Senator, I have not said that we don't know what was contemplated being done there. We do not know what was done there. Senator SCHWEIKER. Why did you delete that reference? Why is that still classified, that particular project of whatever it is? Admiral TURNER. I don't know this particular case. We will get you the exact answer to that one and inform you about it, but it is quite probable that that other case is unrelated to this in the-well, not un- related, but that that was a project that still deserves to be classified. [The material referred to follows:] Construction of the Gorman Annex was begun in 1957 and the Annex was dedicated in March 1959. Of the several MKULTRA projects conducted at Georgetown only one involving human testing covered a time span subsequent to March 1959. Subproject 45 ran from 1955 to 1963, thus it is possible that the final four years (1959-1963) of the subproject could have been spent in the Gorman Annex. However, there is no reference to the Gorman Annex or a "new Annex" in Subproject 45 papers, neither is there any mention of the sub- project moving to a new location in 1959 or later years. Authorization to contribute CIA funds toward construction of the Gorman Annex is contained in Subproject 35 of MKULTRA. Recently discovered material indicated that Dr. Geschickter continued his research for sleep- and amnesia- producing drugs under Project MKSEARCH through July 1967 at Georgetown University Hospital. But it is impossible to determine if the facilities of the Gorman Annex were involved. Senator SCHWEIKER. I think that would give us a pretty good clue as to what was going to be done in the wing the CIA helped to finance. Was there any indication at all in the records you found that the project ultimately used cancer patients or terminally ill patients in connection with this facility? Admiral TURNER. I'm sorry. I missed your question because I was trying to get the data on the last one. I will read you the blank. Senator SCHWEIKER. Go ahead. Admiral TURNER. QKHILLTOP. It doesn't help you, but- Senator SCHWEIKER. Can you tell us what that is, or is it still classified? Admiral TURNER. I don't know, and I assume from the fact that we deleted it, it is still classified, but I will get you that answer, sir. Senator SCHWEIKER. Thank you. I'd like to see that information. [See p. 171 for material referred to.] * Now my next question was: Is there any indication, Admiral, that projects in that particular center involved experimentation on ter- minally ill cancer patients? Admiral TURNER. I missed the first part of your question, sir. I am very sorry. Senator SCHWEIKER. Do you have any indication that some experi- ments in the facility used terminally ill cancer patients as subjects? You do acknowledge in your statement and it is clar from other docu- ments that these kinds of experiments were at some point being done somewhere. My question is, is there any indication that cancer patients or terminally ill patients were experimented with in this wing? Admiral TURNER. Yes, it does appear there is a connection here, sir. Senator SCHWEIKER. The other question I had relates to the de- velopment of something which has been called the perfect concussion. A series of experiments toward that end were described in the CIA documents. I wonder if you would just tell us what your understanding of perfect concussion is. Admiral TURNER. Is that in my testimony, sir, or in some other document? Senator SCHWEIKER. Subproject 54, MKULTRA, which involved examination of techniques to cause brain concussions and amnesia by using weapons or sound waves to strike individuals without giving warning and without leaving any clear physical marks. Someone dubbed it "perfect concussion"-maybe that was poetic license on the part of our staff rather than your poets over there. I wonder if you could just tell us what brain concussion experiments were about? Admiral TURNER. This project, No. 54, was canceled, and never carried out. Senator SCHWEIKER. Well, I do believe the first year of the project in 1955 was carried out by the Office of Naval Research, according to the information that you supplied us. The CIA seems to have been par- ticipating in some way at that point, because the records go on to say that the experimenter at ONR found out about CIA's role, discovered that it was a cover, and then the project was transferred to MKULTRA in 1956. Again, this is all from the backup material you have given us. So, it was canceled at some time. I am not disagreeing with that, but apparently for at least a year or two, somebody was investigating the production of brain concussions with special black- jacks, sound waves, and other methods as detailed in the backup material. Admiral TURNER. The data available to me is that this project was never funded by the CIA, but I will d)uble-check that and furnish the information for the record for you as to whether there was ever any connection here and if so, what the nature of the work was. [The material referred to follows:] Mr. Laubinger corrected his testimony regarding Subproject 54 during the September 21, 1977 hearings before the Subcommittee on Health and Scientific Research of the Human Resources Committee. The relevant portion is reproduced below: Mr. LAIBINGER. On project 54, it has got a rather sensational proposal in there, in terms of the.work that they propose to do, and you asked about the proposal and I said, in fact, it was never funded under MKULTRA. Now, I overlooked--at least, my memory did not serve me correctly when I went through that file folder to see one memorandum dated January 10, 1956, which makes it quite clear, as a matter of fact, that that proposal was based on prior work that was funded by the Agency. Senator ScnwnxKER. By what? Mr. LAUBINGER. By the CIA. So, that information was in their file folder. It did not happen to be in my head when I testified. Senator SCHWEIKER. I think I might have read you that, and that is why I argued at the time with you, because I think I had in front of me, as I recall, some indication that it was funded there. I did read that to you. So, you did supply it to us; there is no argument about that information. Mr. LAUBINGER. Perhaps I am sort of headstrong, myself, and in my own view, I am reading under the ULTRA project, that if it had been funded under ULTRA, it would have had a project number and identified as such. The thing that threw me was that it was funded, apparently, outside of any MKULTRA activity and it was under the normal contracting process, so that it was not included in MKULTRA as 'any work done under that funding umbrella. The file folder that you have and I have, right here, makes it quite clear, however, that a year's work was done through navy funding-a navy funding mechanism-on which the proposal was based that ultimately came into the MKULTRA program. That second proposal was never funded. So, there was conflict and I, personally, I think, introduced a little bit of confusion in that in my testimony. Senator SCHWEIKER. Well, do you agree or not agree with DOD's statement here that even though the initial funding was navy, it was really a conduit for the CIA? Mr. LAUBINGER. I think that is correct. Senator SCHWEIKER. Yes; I would appreciate that. I would like to know how it went from ONR to CIA after a year. Somebody made a decision to make that transfer, and to make this an MKULTRA sub- ject. There had to be some sort of review that led to a decision to continue that kind of concussion-total blackout, maximum amnesia, and whatever else it was you were interested in-study and testing. Mr. LAUBINGER. Senator, if I may try to say a few words on that, the files that were available to us for inspection, which are limited, indicated that there was a project being carried on by the Navy having to do with the effects of brain concussion. The CIA developed an inter- est in that, and considered funding it, but actually never did, and as the admiral testified, the MKULTRA is merely a funding mechanism, a place they go for money to do such things, but there is no evidence that I know of that that project was ever funded. Senator SCHWEIKER. Well, I am confused, because here again is an- other quote from a document that we have seen, which you have re- leased and supplied to us: Following is the technical progress made under the current [deleted] contract: (a) Specialized instrumentation and numerous testing techniques have been developed to obtain the desired dynamic data; (b) considerable data has now been obtained supporting the resonance-cav~ilation theory of brain concussion; and (c) preliminary accelerationi threshold data has been obtained for a fluid-filled glass simulated skull. It goes on to talk about a blast range and a 2 ,5 0 0-square-foot labora- tory. The document notes that "Three blast test series have been run to date." It describes a special blackjack device, "a pancake-type black- jack giving a high peak impact force with a low unit surface pressure." I agree the records are inconclusive as to the results of this work, but it certainly seems that some testing was done. Mr. LAUBINGER. Senator, you are putting us in the same position I think you were stating that you were in earlier in referring to docu- nments not before us, but I believe you are quoting from a proposaL that someone sent to the Agency to fund this work, and he is referring to past work. The past work would have encompassed a lot of things like that, but CIA was not involved with that. Senator SCHWETKER. What do you mean, Admiral, on page 6 of your testimony when you mention projects using magician's art? How do magicians get into the spook business? Admiral TURNER. I have interpreted this as to how to slip the mickey into the finn, but I would like to ask my advisers here to comment. Mr. Bory. I think that is essentially it, Senator. It is surreptitious administration of material to someone, deceptive practices, how to distract someone's attention while you are doing something else, as I understand it. It was also some type of a covert communication project involved with the study of how magicians and their assistants perhaps communicate mformation to one another without having other people know it. This is the type of thing that was involved, sir. Senator SCHWEIKER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator INoUYE. Senator Huddleston? Senator HUDDLESTON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Admiral, in your checking these newly discovered documents and interviewing members of the CIA staff, did you find information that would confirm the contention described by the reporters for the New York Times that this type of experimentation was begun out of a fear at the Agency that foreign powers might have had drugs which would allow them to alter the behavior of American citizens or agents or members of the Armed Forces who were taken into custody, and which would have resulted in false confessions and the like? Is my question clear? Admiral TURNER. Yes, sir. I haven't personally read the documen- tation on that. In my discussions with the people who are well in- formed in this area at the Agency, I am told that that is the case. Senator HUDDLESTON. Was there any evidence or any indication that there were other motives that the Agency might also be looking for (1-ugs that could be applied for other purposes, such as debilitating an individual or even killing another person? Was this part of this kind of experimentation? Admiral TURNER. Yes; I think there is. I have not seen in this series of documentation evidence of desire to kill, but I think the project turned its character from a defensive to an offensive one as it went along, and there certainly was an intention here to develop drugs that could be of use. Senator HUDDLESTON. The project continued for some time after it was learned that, in fact, foreign powers did not have such a drug as was at first feared, didn't it? Admiral TURNER. That is my understanding. Yes, sir. Senator HUDDLESTON. Is there any indication that knowledge gained as a result of these experiments has been useful or is being applied in any way to present operations? Mr. BRODY. Senator, I am not sure if there is any body of knowledge. A great deal of what there was, I gather, was destroyed in 1973. I would like to defer to Frank here. Do you know of any? Mr. LAUBINGER. I know of no drugs or anything like that developed under this program that ever reached operational use or are in use -today.- Senator HUDDLESTON. So apparently any information that was gathered was apparently useless and not worth continuing, not worth further development on the part of the Agency. Mr. LAUBINGER. I am having difficulty hearing your questions. Senator HUDDLESTON. I can hardly hear myself. Admiral TURNER. I think the answer to your question is that we have no evidence of great usefulness on this, and yet I think we should remember- Senator HUDDLESTON. Well, is it accurate to say that this experimen- tation produced few useful results or had little application at all to the operations of the Agency or anybody else as far as we know? Admiral TURNER. I think that is basically correct. At the same time, I would point out that we had two CIA prisoners in China and one in the Soviet Union at this time, and we were concerned as to what kinds of things might be done to them, but I am not saying that- Senator HUDDLESTON. Have you detected any sign that any other na- tion is continuing or has in the past conducted experiments similar to this or with a similar objective? Admiral TURNER. I am not prepared to answer that one off the top of my head, sir, but I will get it to you. [The material referred to follows:] We maintain no files of up-to-date information on. the testing of drugs in foreign countries. Some years ago we occasionally would review foreign research on antibiotics and pharmaceuticals in connection with public bhealth and civil defense assesments. For a few years beginning in 1949 we assessed foreign research on LSD under Project ARTICHOKE because of concern that such drugs might be employed. gainst Agency and other U.S. personnel. Information relative to this work has already been provided to relevant Committees. In this early work we also occasionally looked at foreign human experimentation; we long ago eliminated our holdings on this subject and no collection requirements are any longer served. As consumer interest in this area has dropped off and higher priority areas need attention, we have virtually no present coverage with the possible exception of an occasional scanning of the literature for a specific program. To the best of our knowledge no other unit in the Intelligence Community is tracking this subject now. Senator HUDDLESTON. You don't know whether any of your agents anywhere in the world have been subjected to any kind of procedure like this? Admiral TURNER. We certainly know of other powers conducting research in these areas, yes. Senator HUDDLESTON. Do you know how they go about that research? Admiral TURNER. It is pretty sketchy, the information we have. Senator HUDDLESTON. Do you know of any other organization in this country or any institution that has conducted extensive research on unwitting individuals and through unwitting institutions? Admiral TURNER. Well, I have read something in the newspapers about this, but I have not familiarized myself with it in specifics. Senator HUDDLESTON. It is not a normal mode of operation for hu- man research, is it? Admiral TURNER. No, sir. Senator HUDDLESTON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator INOUYE. Senator Wallop? Senator WVALLOP. Mr. Chairman, I only have one to follow up on Senator Huddleston's questions and my earlier ones. You are not really saying, are you, Admiral Turner, that there are no mind-altering drugs or behavior modification procedures which have been used by foreign powers? Adiniral TURNER. No, sir, I am not. Senator WALLOP. I drew that inference partly in answer to my ques- tion that you knew of no truth serum. Maybe that is a misnomer, but surely there are relaxants that make tongues looser than they would otherwise be. Isn't that true? Admiral TURNER. Yes. Senator WALLOP. So I think it is fair to say, too, that the experience of many American prisoners of war in the Korean conflict would indicate that there are behavior modification procedures in use by foreign powers of a fairly advanced degree of sophistication. Admiral TURNER. Yes, sir. Senator WALLOP. Again, I will just go back and say I think this must have been part of the motivation. I don't think you would have mentioned Cardinal Mindszenty had you thought his behavior was normal at the time or had anybody else. So, I would just again say I think it is a little bit scapegoating. I don't think the object of this hearing is in any way to lay blame on those passed or those dead or otherwise, but I think it is a little bit scapegoating to say that it stopped with the directors of the CIA or the DCI's of the time. Also I think it is a little bit scapegoating to say they didn't even know it, but that it was some lower echelon acting alone. I think this was a behavior pattern that was prevalent in those years, and I think the object lesson is that we have discovered, we think and we hope, through your assurances and other activities of the Congress, means of avoiding future incidents of that kind. I thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator INOUYE. Senator Chafee? Senator CTrAFEE. No questions. Senator INOUYE. Senator Kennedy, I think you have another question. Senator KENNEDY. Just talking about the two safe houses on the east and west coast as being the sources for the unwitting trials, now, the importance of this and the magnitude of it, I think, is of signifi- cance, because we have seen from your records that these were used over a period of 8 or 9 years, and the numbers could have been con- siderable. You are unable to determine, at least in your own research, what the numbers would be and what the drugs were, how many people were involved, but it could have been considerable during this period of time. It would certainly appear to me in examining the documents and the flow charts of cash slips that were expended in these areas that it was considerable, but that is a judgmental factor on it, but I think it is important to try and find out what the Agency is attempting to do to get to the bottom of it. Now, the principal agent that was involved as I understand it is deceased and has been deceased for 2 years. The overall agent, Mr. Gottlieb, has indicated a fuzzy memory about this whole area. He has testified before the Intelligence Committee. Yet he was respon- sible for the whole program. Then, the Director had indicated the destruction of the various materials and unfamiliarity with the project. Now, you have indicated in your testimony today that there are two additional agents on page 9 of your testimony, you indicated there are two additional agents which you have uncovered at the bottom of it, and you say, the names of CIA officials who approved or monitored the various projects. You talk about the two additional agents in your testimony. Now, I am just wondering if you intend to interview those agents to find out exactly what is being done. I suppose, first of all, shouldn't the project manager know what was being done? Admiral TURNER. Our first problem, Senator, is that we have been unable to associate an individual with those names at this point. We are still burrowing to find out who these people are. We haven't identi- fied them as having been CIA employees, and we don't know whether these were false names. Senator KENNEDY. You are tracking that down, as I understand it? Admiral TURNER. Yes, sir. Senator KENNEDY. You are tracking that down, and you have every intention of interviewing those people to find out whatever you can about the program and project? Admiral TURNER. My only hesitation here is whether I will do this or the Justice Department. Senator KENNEDY. It will be pursued, though, I understand? Admiral TURNER. Yes, sir. Senator KENNEDY. Either through the Agency or through the Jus- tice Department? Admiral TURNER. [Nods in the affirmative.] Senator KENNEDY. Is it plausible that the director of the program would not understand or know about the details of the program? Is it plausible that Dr. Gottlieb would not understand the full range of activities in those particular safe houses? 96-408 0 - 77 - 4 Admiral TURNER. Let me say it is unlikely. I don't know Mr. Gott- lieb. Senator KENNEDY. Has anybody in the Agency talked with Mr. Gottlieb to find out about this? Admiral TURNER. Not since this revelation has come out. Senator KENNEDY. Not since this revelation? Well, why not? Armiral TURNER. He has left our employ, Senator. Senator KENNEDY. Does that mean that anybody who leaves is, you know, covered for lifetime? Admiral TURNER. No, sir. Senator KENNEDY. Why wouldn't you talk with him and find out? You have new information about this program. It has been a matter of considerable interest both to our committee and to the Intelligence Committee. Why wouldn't you talk to Mr. Gottlieb? Admiral TURNER. Well, again, I think the issue is whether this should be done by the Justice Department or ourselves. Senator KENNEDY. Well, are we wrestling around because you and Attorney General Bell can't agree- Admiral TURNER. No, sir. Senator KENNEDY [continuing]. On who ought to do it? Admiral TURNER. We are proceeding together in complete agreement as to how to go. I have, in connection with trying to find all of these Americans or others who were unwittingly tested, I have some con- siderable concern about the CIA running around this country inter- viewing and interrogating people, because I don't want to give any impression that we are doing domestic intelligence. Senator KENNEDY. I am just talking about one, in this case. That was the man who was responsible for the whole program, and to find out whether anyone within the Agency since you have had this new material has talked to Gottlieb since 1975, and if the answer is no, I want to know why not. Admiral TURNER. The reason he was not interviewed in connection with the 1975 hearings was that he had left the employ of the CIA and there was a concern on the part of the Agency that it would appear to the investigators that the CIA was in some way trying to influence him and influence his testimony before the committee. If these committees have no objection, we would be happy to contact Dr. Gottlieb and see if he can augment anything here in this new infor- mation, though I don't think there is much in this new information that he can add to as opposed to what was available in 1975. Senator KENNEDY. Well, you see, Admiral Turner, you come to the two committees this morning and indicate that now at last we have the information. We don't have to be concerned about anything in the future on it. Now, I don't know how you can give those assurances to the members of these committees as well as to the American people when you haven't since 1975 even talked to the principal person that was in charge of the program, and the records were destroyed. He is the fellow that was running the program, and the Agency has not talked to him since the development of this new material. Admiral TURNER. Our only concern here is the proprieties involved, and we will dig into this and work with the Justice Department on who, if either of us, should get into discussions with Dr. Gottlieb so as not to prejudice any legal rights that may be involved 'here, or to ap- pear in any way to be improper. Senator KENNEDY. Well, do I understand you have not contacted the Justice Department about this particular case since the development of this new material about Gottlieb? Admiral TURNER. Not about Gottlieb specifically. We have contacted him. Senator KENNEDY. Well, it is amazing to me. I mean, can you under- stand the difficulty that any of us might have in terms of comprehend- ing that when you develop a whole new series of materials that are on the front page of every newspaper in the country and are on every tele- vision, I mean, that means something, but it does not mean nearly as much as the interest that we have in the fact about the testing of un- witting Americans, and every single document that the staff reviews has Mr. Gottlieb's name on it and you come up to tell us that we don't have to worry any more, we have these other final facts, and Mr. Gott- lieb has not been talked to? Admiral TURNER. Sir, I am not saying that these are in any way the final facts. I am saying these are all the facts we have available. Senator KENNEDY. And you have not talked to the person who was in charge of the program, so what kind of value or what kind of weight can we give it? Admiral TURNER. We are happy to talk to him. I thinkthe issue here again is one of propriety and how to go about this. We have not, I believe, enough new information about Gottlieb's participation here to signal that his interview would be that much more revealing than what was revealed in 1975. Senator KENNEDY. The importance of it, I think, from our point of view, is, he would know the drugs that were administered, the vol- ume of drugs, how it was administered, and in terms of your ability to follow up to protect these people and their health, to the extent that it can be done, that opportunity is being lost. I want to get on to some others, but will you give us the assurance that you will get ahold of Gottlieb or that you will talk to Attorney General Bell and talk with Gottlieb? Admiral TURNER. Yes, sir. Senator KENNEDY. And let us know as to the extent of it. I don't see how we can fufill our responsibility in this area on the drug test- ing without our hearing from Gottlieb as well, but I think it is im- portant that you do so, particularly since all of the materials have been destroyed. These other two agents, have they talked to them? Admiral TURNER. We don't know who they are, sir. We are trying to track down and see whether these names can be releated to anybody. Senator KENNEDY. That is under active investigation by the Agency? Admiral TURNER. Yes, sir. Senator KENNEDY. And you have the intention of talking to those people when you locate them. Is that correct? Admiral TURNER. Yes, sir, under the same circumstances as Gottlieb. Senator KENNEDY. And you have people working on it? Admiral TURNER. Yes, sir. Senator KENNEDY. With regards to the activities that took place in these safe houses, as I understand from the records, two-way mirrors were used. Is that your understanding? Admiral TURNER. Yes, sir. We have records that construction was done to put in two-way mirrors. Senator KENNEDY. And they were placed in the bedroom, as I understand. [Pause.] Senator KENNEDY. Well, we have documents Admiral TURNER. I believe that was in the Church record, but I don't have the details. Senator KENNEDY. And rather elaborate decorations were added, as I understand, at least, to the one in San Francisco, in the bedroom, which are French can-can dancers, floral pictures, drapery, including installation of bedroom mirrors, three framed Toulouse Lautrec post- ers with black silk mats, and a number of other-red bedroom cur- tains and recording equipment, and then a series of documents which were provided to the committee which indicate a wide proliferation of different cash for $100, generally in the $100 range over any period of time on the particular checks. Even the names are blocked out, as to the person who is receiving it. Cash for undercover agents, operat- ing expenses, drinks, entertainment while administering, and then it is dashed out, and then the other documents, that would suggest, at least with the signature of your principal agent out there, that- "called to the operation, midnight, and climax." What can you tell us that it might suggest to you about what tech- niques were being used by the Agency in terms of reaching that sort of broad-based group of Americans that were being evidently enticed for testing in terms of drugs and others? Do you draw any kind of conclusion about what might have been going on out there in these safe houses? Admiral TURNER. No, sir. [General laughter.] Senator KENNEDY. There is a light side to it, but there is also an enormously serious side. And that is that at least the techniques which are used or were used in terms of testing, and trying to find out ex- actly the range of drugs used and the numbers of people involved and exactly what that operation was about, as well as the constant reitera- tion of the use of small sums of cash at irregular intervals. A variety of different techniques were employed but there is an awful lot of documentation putting these matters together. When you look at the fact that it is a broad range population that has been tested, tested in these two areas, with the kind of cash slips that were used in this, payment mechanisms and decorations and all of the rest, we are not able to put a bottom line on it but one thing is for sure, and that is, Gottlieb knows. That is one thing for sure, be- cause his name appears on just about every one of these documents, and it is, I think, very important to find out what his understanding is of the nature of that. So, we will hear more about that. Admiral TURNER. I believe Gottlieb has been interviewed by the Congress. Senator KENNEDY. That's right, he has, and in reviewing the record, it is not very satisfactory, and it just seems with the new information and the new documentation and the new memoranda-and he did not have the checks at that time-and with the wide variety of different memoranda with his name on it, his memory could be stimulated on that. Thank you. Senator INOUYE. I would like to thank the admiral and his staff for participating in this hearing. I believe the record should show that this hearing was held at the request of the Agency and the admiral. It was not held because we insisted upon it. It was a volunteer effort on the part of the Agency. I think the record should also indicate that Ad- miral Turner has forwarded to this committee a classified file including all of the names of the institutions and the persons involved as the experimentors. I should also indicate that this hearing is just one step involved in the committee's investigation of drug abuse. Just as you have had much work in going over the 8,000 pages, the staff of this committee has had equal problems, but I would like the record to show that you have made these papers and documents available to the committee. I thank you for that. As part of the ongoing investigation, we had intended to call upon many dozens of others, experimentors, or those officials in charge, and one of those will be Dr. Gottlieb. In thanking you, I would like to say this to the American people, that what we have experienced this morning in this committee room is not being duplicated in any other committee room in any other part of the world. I doubt that very much. Our Agency and our intelligence community has been under much criticism and has been subjected to much abuse, in many cases justified, but this is the most open society that I can think of. For example, in Great Britain there are about six people who are aware of the identity of the man in charge of intelli- gence. In other countries, similar conditions exist. Here in the United States we not only know Admiral Turner, we have had open hearings with him, such as this. The confirmation hearings were all open. In a few weeks, the Senate of the United States will debate a resolu- tion to decide upon whether we should disclose the amounts and funds being used for counterintelligence and national intelligence. I would hope that in presenting this issue to the public, the media will take note that the Agency has cooperated and will continue to. The abuse that we have learned about this morning is one I hope will never happen again, but without constant oversight on the part of the Executive Office, on the part of the Congress, it could happen again. It is impor- tant therefore that we continue in this oversight activity. So, once again, Admiral, I thank you very much for helping us. We will continue to call upon you for your assistance. We would like to submit to you several questions that the members and staff have pre- pared. We hope you will look them over carefully and prepare re- sponses for the record, sir. Senator KENNEDY. Mr. Chairman ? Senator INOUYE. Yes, sir? Senator KENNEDY. I, too, want to thank Admiral Turner for his responsiveness. I have had meetings with him in the committees and also conversations, telephone conversations, and private meetings, and I have found him personally to be extremely responsive, and it is a very difficult challenge which he has accepted in heading this Agency. I want you to know, personally, I, too, would like to see this put behind us. I don't think we are quite there yet in terms of this particular area that we are interested in. I think the Intelligence Committee has special responsibilities in this area of the testing, so we look forward to working with you in expediting the time that we can put it behind, but it does seem to me that we have to dig in and finish the chapter. So, I want to personally express my appreciation to you, Admiral Turner, and thank you for your cooperation and your help, and I look forward to working with you. Admiral TURNER. Thank you. Senator HUDDLESTON. Mr. Chairman, I am not sure you emphasized this enough, but I think the record ought to show that Admiral Turner informed the Select Committee on his own initiative when the new documentation was found. The documentation has been made avail- able to us voluntarily, in a spirit of cooperation. I think this shows a vast difference from the mode of operation that existed prior to the formation at least of the Church committee, and a difference that is very helpful. Senator INOUYE. Thank you very much. Thank you very much, Admiral. We would now like to call upon Mr. Philip Goldman and Mr. John Gittinger. Mr. Goldman and Mr. Gittinger, will you please rise and take the oath. Do you solemly swear that the testimony you are about to give is the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you, God? Mr. GOLDMAN. I do. Mr. GITTINGER. I do. Senator INouYE. Thank you, sir. Mr. Goldman, will you identify yourself, and after that, Mr. Gittinger. Senator KENNEDY. Before we start in, we had a third witness, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Pasternac, who planned to testify, traveled to Wash- ington-he lives in Washington, and was contacted recently-with the intention of testifying this morning. And something-he called us late this morning and indicated that he wanted to get a counsel before he would wish to testify. Senator INOUYE. Mr. Goldman. Mr. Goldman, will you identify yourself, sir. TESTIMONY OF PHILIP GOLDMAN, FORMER EMPLOYEE, CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY Mr. GOLDMAN. I am Philip Goldman. Senator INOUYE. And you are a former employee of the. Central Intelligence Agency? Mr. GOLDMAN. Over 10 years ago. Senator INOUYE. And you were employed at the time when MKULTIRA was in operation? Mr. GoLDMAN. There were some MKULTRA's in operation at the time I was there. Senator INoUYE. And Mr. John Gittinger, are you a former em- ployee of the Central Intelligence Agency? TESTIMONY OF JOHN GITTINGER, FORMER EMPLOYEE, CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY Mr. GITINGER. I am. Senator INOuYE. Are you still an employee? Mr. GITINGER. No. Senator INouYE. Were you a member of the Agency at the time MKULTRA was in operation? Mr. GITINGER. Yes. Senator INouYE. Thank you. Senator Kennedy. Senator KENNEDY. I want to welcome both of you to the committee. If we could start with Mr. Goldman. Were you the project engineer for the safe houses in either San Francisco or New York? Mr. GOLDMAN. I-know of -no safei-ouse irrSan Francisco. Senator KENNEDY. How about in New York? Mr. GOLDMAN. I knew of one facility that was established there, but I didn't know anything of its operation. Senator KENNEDY. Were you a monitor on any testing of drugs on unwitting persons in San Francisco? Mr. GOLDMAN. No. Senator KENNEDY. Well, we have a classified document here that was provided by the Agency that lists your name as a monitor of the pro- gram and I would appreciate it if you would look- Mr. GOLDMAN. I think the misunderstanding arises because I was project officer. Senator KENNEDY. Well, would you take a look at that? [Mr. Goldman inspected the document.] Mr. GOLDMAN. This document as it states is correct. However, my- Senator KENNEDY. That document is correct? Mr. GOLDMAN. As far as I see on the first page, the project. But my- Senator KENNEDY. Well, could I get it back, please. That would indicate that you were a monitor of the program. Mr. GOLDMAN. I was in charge of disbursing the moneys to Morgan Hall. Senator KENNEDY. To whom was that? Mr. GOLDMAN. To the individual whose name was listed at the top of that document. Senator KENNEDY. And you knew that he was running the project in San Francisco? Mr. GOLDMAN. I knew he was the person who was in charge out there. Senator KENNEDY. All right. Mr. GOLDMAN. But I had no knowledge nor did I seek knowledge of actually what he was doing, because there would be other things involved. I did receive Senator KENNEDY. What were you doing? Mr. GOLDMAN. I was collecting-I had to be sure that all the re- ceipts that ever were turned in balanced with the moneys that were paid out to see that everything was run all right. There was no illegal use of funds as far as we could determine by the receipts and cash. Senator KENNEDY. So even though the Agency document indicates that you were a monitor for the program, one of the few monitors of that particular program which you mentioned for San Francisco and Mill Valley, Calif., you described your responsibility only as a carrier of money, is that correct? Mr. GOLDMAN. I would say as a disburser or carrying out-seeing that the moneys were handled properly. There was within that-I don't know what's done or what he did do in conjunction with other people. Senator KENNEDY. Were you responsible for the disbursement of all the funds? Mr. GOLDMAN. I was responsible for turning over the check to him. Senator KENNEDY. And what did you know of the program itself? Mr. GOLDMAN. The only thing I knew of the program was what he furnished us in terms of receipts and that sort of thing. I didn't in- dulge or concern myself in that. Senator KENNEDY. You still wrote, and I'll let you examine it- it's a classified document-but you wrote a rather substantive review of the program in May of 1963, talking about the experiments, the factual data that had been collected, covert and realistic field trials, albout the necessity of those particular-and talked about the effec- tiveness of the various programs, the efficiency of various delivery systems. That doesn't sound to me like someone who is only- Mr. GOLDMAN. Well, if you would refresh my memory, if I could read this I would certainly agree with whatever is said there, if it was written. Senator KENNEDY. I am trying to gather what your role was. You've indicated first of all that you didn't know about-you knew about a safe house in New York; now we find out that you're the carrier for the resources as well and the agent in San Francisco. We find out now that the CIA put you as a monitor. You're testifying that you only were the courier, and here we have just one document, and there are many others that talk about the substance of that program with your name on it and I am just trying to find out exactly what role you were playing. Mr. GOIDMAN. The only thing I can tell you about this and I am drawing completely on my memory is that this individual who was in charge out there conducted these things and reported them back to the Afrency. I didn't participate in any of them. All I know was that he furnished me with receipts for things that were done and told of the work that they had done. Senator KENNEnY. Well, that document covers more than receipts. Mr. GOLDMAN. Yes, it tells of what-they had conducted work out there. Senator KENNEDY. It describes, does it not? Read the paragraph 2. Mr. GOT DMAN. "A numher of covert" Senator KENNEDY. Well, you can't read it, it's a classified document, and I don't know why, quite frankly, but it relates to the substance of those programs and your name is signed to the memorandums on it. I am not interested in you trying to review for us now what is in the document, but I think it would be unfortunate if we were left with the opinion that all you were was a courier of resources when we see a document with your name on it, signed, that talks about the substance of the program. And what we're interested in is the substance of the program. We have the recent documents that were provided by the Agency, which do indicate that you were at least involved in the substance, and I'm just trying to find out whether you're willing to tell us about that. Mr. GOLDMAN. I am perfectly willing to tell you everything that I can remember. Senator KENNEDY. But you can't remember anything. Mr. GOLDMAN. I can't remember the substantive parts of these things, I really can't. Senator KENNEDY. Of the program that was taking place. Do you have any greater familiarity with what was happening in New York? Mr. GOLDMAN. No, no. Senator KENNEDY. And you have the same function with regards to New York? Mr. GOLDMAN. The same function with regard to New York. Senator KENNEDY. Did you ever go to San Francisco? Mr. GOLDMAN. Yes. Senator KENNEDY. Did you meet with the agent in charge? Mr. GOLDMAN. Yes. Senator KENNEDY. And why aid you meet with him? Mr. GOLDMAN. To discuss some of the receipts and things that were there to find out if these were indeed true expenditures and to find out if everything was going along all right for the work that was being done. Senator KENNEDY. What work was being done? Mr. GOLDMAN. No, the reports of these things and whatever was being done. I don't know who he reported to but he did report to somebody. Senator KENNEDY. You travel out there to find out about the work that's being done, and what does he tell you, that the work is being done well and- Mr. GOLDMAN. He told me that the work that they were doing was going along, progressing satisfactorily, but to be very frank with you- Senator KENNEDY. But he didn't tell you what the work was? Mr. GOLDMAN. To be very frank with you, Senator, I cannot re- member the things that happened back in those days. I've been away from the company-from the Agency for over 10 years, and that is even farther back than that, and that was just about the time when I first engaged in this, so it was my first- Senator KENNEDY. Did they disburse a series of $100 checks, to your recollection? Mr. GOLDMAN. I don't recollect it, but if you have it there, then they did. Senator KENNEDY. Did you know Dr. Gottlieb? Mr. GOLDMAN. Yes. Senator KENNEDY. How did you know Dr. Gottlieb? Mr. GOLDMAN. He had been head of the division when I was re- cruited. Senator KENNEDY. Did you talk to him about these programs? Did you have anything to do with him during this period of time? Mr. GOLDMAN. I didn't have anything to do with him until I would say probably in the sixties. Senator KENNEDY. And can you tell us what you had to do with him then? Mr. GOLDMAN. Just what you see there on the papers. Senator KENNEDY. Well, that is the request for the money and he approves it. Mr. GOLDMAN. That is the request for money and he approves it, and I am quite sure that I probably discussed with him whether the work was going along all right, whether his reports were being turned in, and whether he was satisfied with the way things were going and did he have any complaints about the way other people were requesting him, but I did not engage myself in anything he was doing. Senator KENNEDY. Well, did you get the impression that Gottlieb knew what was going on? Mr. GOLDMAN. I didn't ask. Senator KENNEDY. But you told him that your impression that what was going on even though you didn't know what was going on, was go- ing on well, I guess? [Laughter.] Mr. GOLDMAN. I told Gottlieb what you saw in there was that the things appeared to be going along all right. I was repeating and par- roting back the words that were giveh to me while I was there. Senator KENNEDY. What was the money being spent for, do you know? Mr. GOLDMAN. No; I can't recall that, sir. Senator KENNEDY. Would you remember if we told you it was red curtains and can-can pictures- Mr. GOLDMAN. No, sir. Senator KENNEDY. Floral pictures and the rest. Mr. GOLDMAN. No, sir. Senator KENNEDY. Recorders. Mr. GOLDMAN. No, sir. Senator KENNEDY. Recorders and two-way mirrors. Mr. GOLDMAN. Wait, hold on. You're slipping a word in there now. Senator KENNEDY. But you would have authorized those funds, would you not, since you were the- Mr. GOLDMAN. Did you say two-way mirrors? Senator KENNEDY. Yes. Mr. GOLDMAN. Where? Senator KENNEDY. In the safe houses. Mr. GOLDMAN. Where? Senator KENNEDY. San Francisco. Mr. GOLDMAN. No. Senator KENNEDY. How about New York? Mr. GOLDMAN. Yes. Senator KENNEDY. You remember now that you approved expendi- tures for New York? Mr. GOLDMAN. Yes. Senator KENNEDY. What were those expenditures for? Mr. GOLDMAN. That was a transfer of money over for the use in an apartment in New York by the Bureau of Narcotics. It was for their use. Senator KENNEDY. Do you have any knowledge of what was going on in the apartment? Mr. GOLDMAN. No, sir, other than I know that it had been used, ac- cording to the information that I have been given, it was used by the Bureau of Narcotics to make meetings with individuals who they were interested in with regard to pushing dope-not pushing dope, but sell- ing narcotics and that sort of thing. Senator KENNEDY. Well, I am sure you had many responsibilities and it's a long time ago, but the Agency does indicate that you were project monitor for that particular program. Mr. GOLDMAN. That's correct. Senator KENNEDY. Your own testimony indicates you went out to re- view the expenditures of funds to find out whether they were being wisely used, that you came back and talked to the project director, Mr. Gottlieb, to give him a progress report about what was going on out there. Mr. GOLDMAN. Yes, sir, I did. Senator KENNEDY. All those things are true, and yet you draw a complete blank in terms of what was the project itself. That's where the record is now. Mr. GOLDMAN. I did not go out there to review the projects nor did I come back and talk with Mr. Gottlieb and review what I had observed in terms of any projects that they-that is, other parts of the Agency might have in operation there. I simply reported back those things which were told to me by the individual out there who-and I carried them back and they are contained in the report that you have in front of you, word for word, just as it was given to me. Senator KENNEDY. The report that you examined here is a substan- tive report on the particular program and project. And I don't think anyone who wasn't familiar with the project-this is a personal evalu- ation-could write a report on the substance of it without knowing about it. Now, that's mine. Maybe you can't remember and recollect, and that's- Mr. GOLDMAN. No; everything I put down in there is things that I was told while I was out there, and if there was any -ancillary informa- tion involved in there I can tell you I just don't remember that. I really don't. At the time-that was some years ago. At the time-a lot of time has passed since then and I have made quite sure that if I could recollect it at all, I would do it. If you have some papers and you want me to cer- tify whether yes, this is so or that is so, I can do that, but I can't recall it mentally. Senator KENNEDY. You just certified the principal. There are others up here. I would like to go to Dr. Gittinger. Mr. GINGER. It's Mr. Gittinger. Senator KENNEDY. How long did you serve with the Agency? Mr. GIrrNGER. Twenty-six years. Senator KENNEDY. Excuse me? Mr. GITINGER. Twenty-six years., Senator KENNEDY. Twenty-six years. And at some point you moved into the operational support side, is that correct? Mr. GrlINGER. Yes. Senator KENNEDY. And did you know Sidney Gottlieb? Mr. GirrINGER. Yes, sir. Senator KENNEDY. And did he inform you about the research proj- ects involving LSD? Mr. GITTINGER. Yes, sir. Senator KENNEDY. It is my understanding that you were also aware of some of the drug testing projects conducted on unwitting subjects on the west coast using the Bureau of Narcotics people in the operation. Is that true? Mr. GITTINGER. I was. Senator INOUYE. Excuse me. Would you speak into the microphone? I cannot hear you. Mr. GITTINGER. Sorry. Senator KENNEDY. Do you know which drugs were involved in those tests? Mr. GIrrINGER. LSD. And I can't remember for sure much of the others. What is the substance of marihuana, cannabis, is that right, that can be delivered by other than smoking? Senator KENNEDY. Cannabis? Mr. GITTINGER. There had been some discussion of that; yes. Senator KENNEDY. And was heroin also used? Mr. GITTINGER. Heroin used by CIA? Senator KENNEDY. No. In the west coast operation. Mr. GITINGER. Absolutely not. Senator KENNEDY. Now, to your knowledge, how were the drugs ad- ministered to the unwitting subjects? Mr. GIrTINGER. I have no direct knowledge. Senator KENNEDY. Why did you go to the safe houses? Mr. GITTINGER. It's a very complicated story. Just in justification of myself, this came up just day before yesterday. I have not really had enough time to get it all straightened in my mind, so I ramble. Senator KENNEDY. Well, you take your time and tell us in your own words. We've got some time here. Mr. GITTINGER. My responsibilities which would involve any of the period of time that you were talking about really was not -directly related to drugs at all. I was a psychologist charged with the responsi- bility of trying to develop as much information as I could on various cultures, overseas cultures, anthropological type data, if you follow what I mean. I was also engaged in trying to work out ways and means of assessing people and understanding people. I originally became involved in this through working on Chinese culture, and over a series of time I was introduced to the problem of brainwashing, which is the thing that really was the most compelling thing in relationship to this, and became charged with the responsi- bility of trying to find out a little bit about interrogation techniques. And among other things, we decided or I decided that one of the best sources of interrogation techniques would be trying to locate and inter- view and become involved with experienced police interrogators in the country and experienced people who had real practical knowledge of interrogation. The reason for this is that we had become pretty well convinced after the experience of the brainwashing problems coming out of China, that it was the techniques of the interrogators that were causing the individuals to make confessions and so forth in relationship to this, rather than any kind of drugging and so forth. So we were very much interested in interrogation techniques, and this led to me being introduced to the agent in the west coast, and I began to talk to him in connection with these interrogation techniques. Senator KENNEDY. OK. Now, that is the agent that ran the tests on the west coast on the unwitting people. That's where you come in, correct? Mr. GirrlNGER. If I understand-would you say that again? Senator KENNEDY. The name Morgan Hall has been-that is the name that has been used. Mr. GrINGER. Yes. Senator KENNEDY. And that is the agent that you met with. Mr. GIrrlNGER. That is right. Senator KENNEDY. And you met at the safe house. Mr. GIrrINGER. Yes, sir. Senator KENNEDY. Whom did you meet with in the safe house? Mr. GITTINGER. This is the part that is hard for me to say, and I am sorry that I have to. In connection with some work that we were doing, we needed to have some information on sexual habits. Morgan Hall provided informants for me to talk to in connection with the sex habits that I was interested in trying to find information. During one period of time the safe house, as far as I was concerned, was used for just these particular type of interviews. And I didn't see the red curtains. Senator KENNEDY. Those were prostitutes, were they? Mr. GITTINGER. Yes, sir. Senator KENNEDY. How many different times were you there that you had similar- Mr. GITTINGER. I couldn't possibly say with any certainty on that. Four or five times. Senator KENNEDY. Four or five times. Mr. GirrlNGER. Over-you remember now, the period that I'm talk- ing about when I would have any involvement in this is from about 1956 to 1961. So it's about a 4- or 5-year period which is the only time that I know anything about what you are talking about here today. Senator KENNEDY. Did Morgan Hall make the arrangements for the prostitutes to meet with you? Mr. GITTINGER. Yes, sir. Senator KENNEDY. Did the interviews that you had have anything to do with drugs? Mr. GIrrINGER. Well, as I tried to explain earlier when this was being discussed a little bit beforehand, again I think it is pretty hard for most people now to recognize how little there was known about drugs at the period of time that we are talking about, because the drug age or the drug culture comes later on. Consequently, those of us who had any responsibility in this area were interested in trying to get as much information as we could on the subculture, the subculture drug groups, and obviously the Bureau of Narcotics represented a means of doing this. Consequently, other types of things that were involved in discussions at that time would have to do with the under- ground use of drugs.. When 1 am talking about this I am talking about the folkways in terms of unwitting use of drugs. Did these people that I was talking to have any information about this and on rare instances they were able to tell me about their use, and in most cases this would largely turn out to be a Mickey Finn or something of that sort rather than anything esoteric. I also was very much interested because we had relatively little information, believe it or not, at that time, in terms of the various reactions that people were having to drugs. Therefore, these people were very informative in terms of they knew a great deal of informa- tion about reactions. Senator KENNEDY. At least you gathered-or am I correct in assum- ing that you gathered the impression that the prostitutes that you had talked to were able to slip the drugs to people as I understand it. Did you form any impression on that? Mr. GITTINGER. I certainly did not form the impression that they did this as a rule or- Senator KENNEDY. But they had the knowledge. Mr. GITTINGER. They had the knowledge or some of them had had knowledge of this being done. But again, as it turned out, it was largely in this area of knockout drops. Senator KENNEDY. Looking back now did you form any impression about how the Agency was actually testing the broad spectrum of social classes in these safe houses? With the large disbursal of cash in small quantities, $100 bills and the kinds of elaborate decorations and two-way mirrors in the bedrooms and all the rest, is there any question in your own mind what was going on in the safe houses, or the tech- niques that were being used to administer these drugs? Mr. GITTINGER. I find it very difficult to answer that question, sir. I had absolutely no direct knowledge there was a large number of this. I had no knowledge that anyone other than-than Morgan Hall was in any way involved in the unwitting administration of drugs. Senator KENNEDY. But Gottlieb would know, would he not? Mr. GITTINGER. I believe so, yes, sir. Senator KENNEDY. Could we go into the Human Ecology Founda- tion and talk about that and how it was used as an instrument in terms of the support of research? Mr. GITTINGER. Yes, sir. Senator KENNEDY. Could you describe it to us? Could you describe the Human Ecology Foundation, how it functioned and how it worked? Mr. GITTINGER. May I tell something about how it evolved, which I think is important? Senator KENNEDY. Sure. Mr. GITTINGER. The Society for the Investigation of Human Ecol- ogy, so-called, was actually a-I am confused here now as to whether I should name you names. Senator KENNEDY. Well, we're not interested in names or institu- tions, so we prefer that you do not. That has to be worked out in arrangements between Admiral Turner and the individuals and the institutions. But we're interested in what the Foundation really was and how it functioned and what its purpose was. Mr. GirriNGER. Tell, it was established to undertake research in the general area of the behavioral -sciences. It definitely had almost no focus or interest in, say, drug-related type of activities except in a very minor way, because it was largely set up to attempt to gain a certain amount of information and to fund projects which were psychological, sociological, anthropological in character. It was established in the sense of a period of time that a lot of us who are in it wish we could do it over again, but we were interested in trying to get together a panel of the most representative high-level behavioral scientists we could to oversee and help in terms of developing the Society for the Investiga- tion of Hunan Ecology type of program. The Agency in effect provided the money. They did not direct the projects. Now, the fact of the matter is, there are a lot of innocent peo- ple who received the Society for the Investigation of Human Ecology money which I know for a fact they were never asked to do anything for the CIA but they did get through this indirectly. They had no knowledge that they were getting CIA money. Senator KENNEDY. Over what period of time did this take place? Mr. GrrrINGER. As far as I was concerned, it was the period of time ending in 1961. I believe the Human Ecology fund finally phased out in 1965, but I was not involved in this phasing out. Senator KENNEDY. Can you give the range of the different sort of individual projects of the universities in which it was active? Mr. GITTINGER. Well, it would have as many as-I am very fuzzy on my memory on the number of projects. It is over 10, 20, 30. Senator KENNEDY. After it made the grants, what was the relation- ship of the Agency with the results of the studies? The Foundation acquired the money to make the grants from the Agency, and then it made the grants to these various research programs. Mr. GrrrlNGER. Yes, sir. Senator KENNEDY. And that included eight universities as well as individual researchers? Mr. GIrlNGER. Yes, sir. Senator KENNEDY. Then what follow-up was there to that, sir? Mr. GIrrlNGER. Well, in every sense of the word, the organization was run exactly like any other foundation, and it carried with it the same thing in terms of making certain that the people that they had given money to used it for the purpose for which it had been granted, that they had access to any of the reports that they had put out, but there were no strings attached to anybody. There wasn't any reason they couldn't publish anvthing thst thev put out. Senator KENNEDY. What sort of budget are we talking about here? Mr. GrrrlNGER. I honestly do not remember. I would iuess we are talking in the realm of about $150,000 a year, but don't hold me to that, because I don't know. Senator KENNEDY. What is your view about such funding as a pro- fessional person, in terms of compromising the integrity of a univer- sity, sir? . Mr. GITrlNGER. Well, obviously, sir, insofar as today there is no question about it. I will have to say at the time that we were doing this there was quite an entirely different kind of an attitude, and I do know for a fact that we moved to start towards phasing out the So- ciety for the Investigation of Human Ecology and the Human Ecol- ogy Fund for the very reason that we were beginning to recognize that it was moving into an area but this would be compromised. Senator KENNEDY. Well, that is commendable, both your attitude and the reasons for it, but during that period of time it still was in- volved in behavior research programs, as I understand it. Mr. GirlNGERZ. Yes, sir. On its own, in connection with this, it participated again, and these again were not CIA-directed projects, but these were all things which would theoretically contribute to the general knowledge at the time where the things like the study of the Hungarian refugees-obviously, the study of the Hungarian refugees who came to this country after the Hungarian revolt was a very use- ful exercise to try to get information about the personality character- istics of the Communists and so forth. Senator KENNEDY. Were there other foundations that were doing similar kinds of work? Mr. GlrrNGER. Not to my knowledge, sir. Senator KENNEDY. You believe- Mr. GirlNGER. You mean, CIA, other CIA? Senator KENNEDY. Right. Mr. GITrrNGER. Well, my answer is in the sense that I know of no other CIA foundations, no. There were, of course, other foundations doing similar kinds of work in the United States. Senator KENNEDY. Have you heard of the Psychological Assess- ments Foundation? Mr. GIrrlNGER. I certainly have. Senator KENNEDY. What was that? What function did that have? Mr. GITTrNGER. Now, this was bringing us up to a different era. I believe the functions of that organization have nothing whatsoever to do with the things that are being talked about here while I was associated with it. Senator KENNEDY. Rather than getting into the work, it was another foundation, was it not? It was another foundation supported by the Agency? Mr. GrTNGER. What, the Psychological Assessment? Senator KENNEDY. Yes. Mr. GrnNGER. No, sir, it was not. Senator KENNEDY. It did not get any support at all from the Agency? Mr. GIrlNGER. Oh, yes, sir. It did get support, but it was a business firm. Senator KENNEDY. It was a business but it got support from the Agency? Mr. GIrrINGER. It got money from it, but it definitely was not in MKULTRA or in any way associated with this. Senator KENNEDY. All right. I want to thank you for your helpful testimony, Mr. Gittinger. It is not easy to go back into the past. I think you have been very fair in your characterizations, and I think it is quite appropriately indicated that there are different standards now from what they were 25 years ago, and I think you have responded very fairly and completely to the inquiries, and I think with a good deal of feeling about it. You are a person who is obviously attempting to serve the country's interest, so I want to thank you very much for your statement and for your helpful timeliness. Mr. GITINGER. Thank you, sir. Senator INoU-i. Senator Case? Senator CASE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am sorry that I had another committee that I had to complete the hearing with this morn- ing before I got here. I shall read the testimony with very great interest, and I appreci- ate your testimony as I have heard it. I would like to comment just on one point, and that is, it relates to a story in the press yesterday about part of this program involving the funding of a grant at a foreign university. I would like to elicit from you a comment as to the addi- tional sensitivity and difficulty that that practice involves from your standpoint as a scientist, as well as a citizen, if you will. Mr. GITINGER. I will say it was after the fact thinking. It was utter stupidity the way things worked out to have used some of this money outside the United States when it was CIA money. I can categorically state to my knowledge and I don't claim a complete knowledge all the way across of the human ecology functions, but to my knowledge, and this is unfortunate, those people did not know that they were getting money from CIA, and they were not asked to contribute anything to CIA as such. Senator CASE. It would be interesting to try to examine this by turn- ing the thing around and thinking what we would think if this hap- pened from a foreign official agency to our own university. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator INOUYE. Senator Schweiker. Senator SCHWEIKER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Dr. Goldman, I wonder if you would tell us what your training and educational background is? Dr. GOLDMAN. I have already given a biography for the record. Senator SCHWETKER. I have not seen it. Who has it? Is it classified? We may have it for the record, but may I ask you to briefly describe your training and background for us now? I hope it is no secret. Dr. GOLDMAN. Well, I was told if I was asked this to say that. I was told that by your staff people, but I have no objection to telling you. I am a resident from Pennsylvania, southwest Pennsylvania, Lan- caster County. I went to Penn State, and I am in nutrition. Senator SOHWEIKER. In what? Dr. GOLDMAN. Nutrition. Senator SCHWEIKER. Were you in charge of a section or segment of the CIA in your past capacity? Dr. GOLDMAN. During the time I was with that organization, I was in charge of one small section of it, one small segment of it; yes. 96-408 0 - 77 - 5 Senator SCHWEIKER. What was the function or purpose of that sec- tion that you headed? Dr. GOLDMAN. To provide support for the other parts of the division. Senator SCHWEIKER. Where in the chain of command would that put you in relation to Dr. Gottlieb? Dr. GOLDMAN. Pretty far down the line. Senator SCHWEIKER. Mr. Gittinger, I would just like to ask you a few questions. We appreciate your frankness and candor with the com- mittee, and we realize this is a very difficult area to go into. I am not quite clear on two matters that were raised earlier. First, were the safe houses we were talking about here used on occasion by the prostitutes you referred to? Mr. GITTINGER. I really have not the slightest idea. Senator SCHWEIKER. Were the prostitutes used in any way to slip the customers drugs for observation purposes? Mr. GrTiNGER. Not to my direct knowledge. Senator SCHWEIKER. Would you have been in a position to know the answer to either of these questions? Mr. GITTINGER. May I say, probably not, and may I make an aside to explain a little bit of this, please, sir? Senator SCHWEIKER. Mr. Gittinger, a moment ago you mentioned brainwashing techniques, as one area that you had, I guess, done some work in. How would you characterize the state of the art of brain- washing today? Who has the most expertise in this field, and who is or is not doing it in terms of other governments? During the Korean war there was a lot of serious discussion about brainwashing techniques being used by the North Koreans, and I am interested in finding out what the state of the art is today, as you see it. Mr. GITTINGER. Well, of course, there has been a great deal of work on this, and there is still a great deal of controversy. I can tell you that as far as I knew, by 1961, 1962, it was at least proven to my satis- faction that brainwashing, so called, is some kind of an esoteric device where drugs or mind-altering kinds of conditions and so forth were used, did not exist even though "The Manchurian Candidate" as a movie really set us back a long time, because it made something im- possible look plausible. Do you follow what I mean ? But by 1962 and 1963, the general idea that we were able to come up with is that brain- washing was largely a process of isolating a human being, keeping him out of contact, putting him under long stress in relationship to interviewing and interrogation, and that they could produce any change that way without having to resort to any kind of esoteric means. Senator SCHWEIKER. Are there ways that we can ascertain this from a distance when we see a captive prisoner either go on television, in a photograph, or at a press conference? In other words, are there cer- tain signs that you have learned to recognize from your technical background, to tell when brainwashing has occurred? Or is that very difficult to do? Mr. GITTINGER. It is difficult to do. I think it is posible now in terms of looking at a picture of somebody who has been in enemy hands for a long period of time. We can get some pretty good ideas of what kind of circumstances he has been under, if that is what you mean. Senator SCHWEIKER. That is all I have, Mr. Chairman. Thank you. Senator INOUYE. Thank you very much. Before adjourning the hearings, I would like to have the record show that Dr. Goldman and Mr. Gittinger have voluntarily cooperated with the committee in staff interviews, that they appear this morning voluntarily, and they are not under subpena. Gentlemen, I realize that this experience may have been an unhappy one and possibly a painful one. Therefore, we thank you very much for participating this morning. We also realize that the circumstances of that time differed very much from this day, and possibly the na- tional attitude, the national political attitude condoned this type of activity. So, we have not asked you to come here as persons who have committed crimes, but rather in hope that you can assist us in studying this problem so that it will not occur once again. In that spirit we thank you for your participation, and we look forward to working with you further in this case. Thank you very much. Senator KENNEDY. Mr. Ohairman, I would like also to thank the witnesses. These are difficult matters, and I think all of us are very grateful. Senator SCHWEIKER. I think the witnesses should know that though it may not always seem that way, what we are trying to do is to probe the past and look at the policies of the past to affect the future. I think our emphasis really is on the future, not the past, but it is important that we learn from the past as we formulate policies and legislation for the future, I hope that all of the witnesses who did come before us voluntarily this morning, including Admiral Turner respect the fact that we are questioning the past to learn about the future. I think it should be looked at in that light. Senator KENNEDY. I think that is the spirit in which we have had these hearings. It seems to me that from both these witnesses and others, Gottlieb knows the information and can best respond, and we are going to make every effort in the Senate Health Committee to get Mr. Gottlieb to appear, and we obviously look forward to cooperating with Senator Inouye and the other members of the committee in get- ting the final chapter written on this, but we want to thank you very much for your appearance here. Senator INOUYE. The hearing will stand in recess, subject to the call of the Chair. [Whereupon, at 12:12 p.m., the -hearing was recessed, subject to the call of the Chair.] APPENDIX A XVII. TESTING AND USE OF CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGI- CAL AGENTS BY THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY Under its mandate ' the Select Committee has studied the testing and use of chemical and biological agents by intelligence agencies. Detailed descriptions of the programs conducted by intelligence agencies in- volving chemical and biological agents will be included in a separately published appendix to the Senate Select Committee's report. This sec- tion of the report will discuss the rationale for the programs, their monitoring and control, and what the Committee's investigation has revealed about the relationships among the intelligence agencies and about their relations with other government agencies and private in- stitutions and individuals.2 Fears that countries hostile to the United States would use chemi- cal and biological agents against Americans or America's allies led to the development of a defensive program designed to discover tech- niques for American intelligence agencies to detect and counteract chemical and biological agents. The defensive orientation soon became secondary as the possible use of these agents to obtain information from, or gain control over, enemy agents became apparent. Research and development programs to find materials which could be used to alter human behavior were initiated in the late 1940s and early 1950s. These experimental programs originally included testing of drugs involving witting human subjects, and culminated in tests using unwitting, nonvolunteer human subjects. These tests were de- signed to determine the potential effects of chemical or biological agents when used operationally against individuals unaware that they had received a drug. The testing programs were considered highly sensitive by the in- telligence agencies administering them. Few people, even within the agencies, knew of the programs and there is no evidence that either the executive branch or Congress were ever informed of them. The highly compartmented nature of these programs may be explained in part by an observation made by the CIA Inspector General that, "the knowledge that the Agency is engaging in unethical and illicit activi- 1 Senate Resolution 21 directs the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities to investigate a number of issues: "(a) Whether agencies within the intelligence community conducted illegal domestic activities (Section 2(1) and (2)); "(b) The extent to which agencies within the intelligence community cooper- ate (Section 2(4) and (8)); "(c) The adequacy of executive branch and congressional oversight of intel- ligence activities (Section 2(7) and (11)); "(d) The adequacy of existing laws to safeguard the rights of American citi- zens (Section 2(13))." 'The details of these programs may never be known. The programs were highly compartmented. Few records were kept. What little documentation existed for the CIA's principal program was destroyed early in 1973. (385) (65) 386 ties would have serious repercussions in political and diplomatic circles and would be detrimental to the accomplishment of its missions." 3 The research and development program, and particularly the co- vert testing programs, resulted in massive abridgments of the rights of American citizens, sometimes with tra'gic consequences. The deaths of two Americans 3a can be attributed to these programs; other partici- pants in the testing programs may still suffer from the residual ef- fects. While some controlled testing of these substances might be de- fended, the nature of the tests, their scale, and the fact that they were continued for years after the danger of surreptitious administration of LSD to unwitting individuals was known, demonstrate a funda- mental disregard for the value of human life. The Select Committee's investigation of the testing and use of chem- ical and biological agents also raise serious questions about the ade- quacy of command and control procedures within the Central Intelli- gence Agency and military intelligence, and about the relationships among the intelligence agencies, other governmental agencies, and private institutions and individuals. The CIA's normal administrative controls were waived for programs involving chemical and biological agents to protect. their security. According to the head of the Audit Branch O-f the CIA. these waivers produced "gross administrative failures." They prevgnted the CIA's internal review mechanisms (the Office of General Counsel, the Inspector General, and the Audit Staff) from adequately supervising the programs. In general, the waivers had the paradoxical effect of providing less restrictive administrative con- trols and less effective internal review for controversial and highly sensitive projects than those governing normal Agency activities. The security of the programs was protected not only by waivers of normal administrative controls, but also by a high degree of com- partmentation within the CIA. This compartmentation excluded the CIA's Medical Staff from the principal research and testing program employing chemical and biological agents. It also may have led to agency policymakers receiving differing and inconsistent responses when they posed questions to the CIA component involved. Jurisdictional uncertainty within the CIA was matched by juris- dictional conflict among the various intelligence agencies. A spirit of cooperation and reciprocal exchanges of information which initially characterized the programs disappeared. Military testers withheld in- lormation from the CIA, ignoring suggestions for coordination from their superiors. The CIA similarly failed to provide informiation to the military on the CIA's testing program. This failure to cooperate was conspicuously manifested in an attempt by the Army to conceal 3CIA Inspector General's Survey of TSD, 1957, p. 217. " On January 8, 1953. Mr. Harold Blauer died of circulatory collapse and heart failure following an intravenous injection of a synthetic mescaline derivative while a subject of tests conducted by New York State Psychiatric Institute under a contract let by the U.S. Army Chemical Corps. The Committee's investigation into drug testing by U.S. intelligence agencies focused on the testing of LSD, how- ever, the committee did receive a copy of the U.S. Army Inspector General's Report, issued on October 1975, on the events and circumstances of Mr. Blauer's death.

Learning of the Army's program, the Agency surreptitiously attempted to obtain details of it. The-decision to institute one of the Army's LSD field testing projects had been based, at least in part, on the finding that no long-term resid- ual effects had ever resulted from the drug's administration. The CIA's failure to inform the Army of a death which resulted from the surreptitious administration of LSD to unwitting Americans, may well have resulted in the institution of an unnecessary and potentially lethal program. The development, testing, and use of chelnical and biological agents by intelligence agencies raises serious questions about the relationship between the intelligence community and foreign governments, other agencies of the Federal Government, and other institutions and in- dividuals. The questions raised range from the legitimacy of American complicity in actions abroad which violate American and foreign laws to the possible compromise of the integrity of public and private insti- tutions used as cover by intelligence agencies. A. THE PROGRAMS INVESTIGATED 1. Project CHATTER Project CHATTER was a Navy program that began in the fall of 1947. Responding to reports of "amazing results" achieved by the Soviets in using "truth drugs," the program focused on the identifica- tion and testing of. such drugs for use in interrogations and in the recruitmenc of agents. The research included laboratory experiments on animals and hump , subjects involving Anabasis aphylla, scopola- mine, and rhescaline in order to determine their speech-inducing quali- ties. Overseas experiments were conducted as part of the project. The project expanded substantially during the Korean War, and ended shortly after the war, in 1953. . 2. Project BLUEBIRD/ARTICHOKE The'earliest of the CIA's major programs involving the use of chemical and biological agents, Project BLUEBIRD, was approved by the Director in 1950. Its objectives were: (a) discovering means of conditioning personnel to prevent unauthorized extraction of information from them by known means, (b) investigating the possibility of control of an in- dividual by application of special interrogation techniques, (c) memory enhancement, and (d) establishing defensive means for preventing hostile control of Agency personnel.4 As a result of interrogations conducted overseas during the project, another goal was added-the evaluation of offensive uses of unconven- t:ional interrogation techniques, including hypnosis and drugs. In *August 1951, the project was renamed ARTICHOKE. Project ARTI- CHOKE included in-house experiments on interrogation techniques, conducted "under medical and security controls which would ensure 'CIA memorandum to the Select Committee, "Behavioral Drugs and Testing," 2/11/75. 388 that no damage was done to individuals who volunteer for the experi- ments."' Overseas interrogations utilizing a combination of sodium pentothal and hypnosis after physical and psychiatric examinations of the subjects were also part of ARTICHOKE. The Office of Scientific Intelligence (OSI), which studied scientific advances by hostile powers, initially led BLUEBIRD/ARTICHOKE efforts. In 1952, overall responsibility for ARTICHOKE was trans- ferred from OSI to'the Inspection and Security Office (I&SO), pre- decessor to the present Office of Security. The CIA's Technical Serv- ices and Medical Staffs were to be called upon as needed; OSI would retain liaison function with other government agencies.- The change in leadership from an intelligence unit to an operating unit appar- ently reflected a change in emphasis; from the study of actions by hostile powers to the use, both for offensive and defensive purposes, of special interrogation techniques-primarily hypnosis and truth serums. Representatives. from each Agency unit involved in ARTICHOKE met almost monthly to discuss their progress. These discussions in- cluded the planning of overseas interrogations8 as well as further experimentation in the U.S. . Information about project ARTICHOKE 'after the fall of 1953 is scarce. The CIA maintains that the project ended in 1956, but evi- dence suggests that Office of Security and Office of Medical Services use of "special interrogation" techniques continued for several years thereafter. 3. IKNAOMI MKNAOMI was another major CIA program in this area. In 1967, the CIA summarized the purposes of MKNAOMI: (a) To provide for a covert support base to meet clandes- tine operational requirements. (b) To stockpile severely incapacitating and lethal ma- terials for the specific use of TSD [Technical Services Di- vision]. (c) To maintain in operational readiness special and unique items for the dissemination of biological and chemical ma- terials. (d) To provide for the required surveillance, testing, up- grading, and evaluation of materials and items in order to assure absence of defects and complete predictability of re- sults to be expected under operational conditions.9 Under an agreement reached with the Army in 1952, the Snecial Operations Division (SOD) at Fort Detrick was to assist CIA in developing, testing, and maintaining biological agents and delivery 5 Memorandum from Robert Taylor, O/DD/P to the Assistant Deputy (In- spection and Security) and Chief of the Medical Staff, 3/22/52. a Memorandum from H.

For a fuller descrip- tion of MKNAOMI and the relationship between CIA and SOD. see p. 360 ff. 389 systems. By this agreement, CIA acquired the knowledge, skill, and facilities of the Army to develop biological weapons suited for CIA use. SOD developed darts coated with biological agents and pills con- taining several dif.rent biological agents which could remain potent for weeks or months. SOD also developed a special gun for firing darts coated with a chemical which could allow CIA agents to incapaci- tate a guard dog, enter an installation secretly, and return the dog to consciousness when leaving. SOD scientists were unable to develop a similar incapacitant for humans. SOD also physically transferred to CIA personnel biological agents in "bulk" form, and delivery devices, including some containing biological agents. In addition to the CIA's interest in biological weapons for use against humans, it also asked SOD to study use of biological agents against crops and animals. In its 1967 memorandum, the CIA stated: Three methods and systems for carrying out a covert attack against crops and causing severe crop loss have been devel- oped and evaluated under field conditions. This was accom- plished in anticipAtion of a requirement which was later developed but was subsequently scrubbed just prior to put- ting into action.sa - MKNAOMI was terminated in 1970. On November 25, 1969, Presi- dent Nixon renounced the use of any form of biological weapons that kill or incapacitate and ordered the disposal of existing stocks of bac- teriological weapons. On February 14, 1970, the President clarified the extent of his earJier order and indicated that toxins-chemicals that are not living organisms but are produced by living organisms-were considered biological weapons subject to his previous directive and were to be destroyed. Although instructed to relinquish control of material held for the CIA by 9OD, a CIA scientist acquired approxi- mately 11 grams of shellfish toxin from SOD personnel at Fort De- trick which were stored in a little-used CIA laboratory where it went undetected for five years.'0 4. MKULTRA MKULTRA was the principal CIA program involving the research and development of chemical and biological agents. It was "con- cerned with the research and development of chemical, biological, and radiological materials capable of employment in clandestine oper- ations to control human behavior." 11 In January 1973, MKULTRA records were destroyed by Technical Services Division personnel actin on the verbal orders of Dr. Sidney Gottlieb, Chief of TSD. Dr. Gottlieb has testified, and former Direc- tor Helms has confirmed, that in ordering the records destroyed, Dr. Gottlieb was carrying out the verbal order of then DCI Helms. MKULTRA began with a proposal from the Assistant Deputy Director for Plans, Richard Helms, to the DCI, outlining a special * Ibid. p. 2. '0 Senate Select Committee, 9/16/75, Hearings, Vo. 1. n Memorandum from the CIA Inspector General to the Director, 7/26/63. 390 funding mechanism for highly sensitive CIA research and develop- ment projects that studied the use of biological and chemical materials in altering human behavior. The projects involved: Research to develop a capability in the covert use of bio- logical and chemical materials. This alea involves the produc- tion of various physiological conditions which could support present or future clandestine operations. Aside from the of- fefisive potential, the development of a comprehensive capa- bility in this field of covert chemical and biological warfare gives us a thorough knowledge of the enemy's theoretical potential, thus enabling us to defend ourselves against a foe who might not be as restrained in the use of these tech- niques as we are. 12 MKULTRA was approved by the DCI on April 13, 1953 along the lines proposed by ADDP Helms. Part of the rationale for the establishment of this special fund- ing mechanism was its extreme sensitivity. The Inspector General's survey of MKULTRA in 1963 noted the following reasons for this sensitivity: a. Rih earch in the mailipulation of human behavior is con- sidered by man7. zuthorities in medicine and related fields to be professionaily unethical, therefore the reputation of professional participants in the MIKULTRA-program are on occasion in jeopardy. b. Some MKILTRA activities raise questions of legality implicit in the original charter. - c. A final phase of the testing of MKULTRA products places the rights and interests of U.S. citi7ens in jeopardy. d. Public disclosure of some aspects of MKULTRA activ- ity could induce serious adverse reaction in U.S. public opinion, as well as stimulate offensive and defensive action in this field on the part of foreign intelligence services."3 Over the ten-year life of the program, many "additional avenues to the control of human behavior" were designated as appropriate for investigation under the MICULTRA charter. These include "radiation, electroshock, various fields of psychology, psychiatry, sociology, and anthropoloy, graphology, harassment substances, and paramilitary devices and materials." 14 The research and development of materials to be used for altering human behavior consisted of three phases: first, the search for ma- terials suitable for study; second, laboratory testing on voluntary human snbiects in various types of institutions; third, the application of MKTTLTRA materials in normal life settings. The search for suitable materials was conducted through standing arrangements with snecialists in universities, pharmaceutical houses, hospitals, state and federal institutions, and private research orgam- u'femorandum from ADDP Holms to DCI Dulles, 4/3/53, Tab A, pp. 1-2. T.G. Report on MKULTRA, 1963, pp. 1-2. rbid, p. 4. 71 391 zations. The annual grants of funds to these specialists were made under ostensible research foundation auspices, thereby concealing the CIA's interest from the specialist's institution. The next phase of the MKITLTRA program involved physicians, toxicologists, and other specialists in mental, narcotics, and general hospitals, and in prisons. Utilizing the products and findings of the basic research phase, they conducted intensive tests on human subjects. I One of the first studies was conducted by the National Institute of Mental Health. This study was intended to test various drugs, includ- ing hallucinogenics, at the NIMH Addiction Research Center in Lex- ington, Kentucky. The "Lexington Rehabilitation Center," as it was then called, was a prison for drug addicts serving sentences for drug violations. The test subjects were volunteer prisoners who, after taking a brief physical examination and signing a general consent form, were admin- istered hallucinogenic drugs. As a reward for participation in the program, the addicts were provided with the druz of their addiction. LSD was one of the materials tested in the MIKULTRA program. The final phase of LSD testing involved surreptitious administration to unwitting nonvolunteer subjects in normal life settings by under- cover officers of the Bureau of Narcotics acting for the CIA. The rationale for such testing was "that testing of materials under accepted scientific procedures fails to disclose the full pattern of reac- tions and attributions that may occur in operational situations." 15 According to the CIA, the advantage of the relationship with the Bureau was that test subjects could be sought and cultivated within the setting of narcotics control. Some subjects have been informers or members of suspect criminal elements from whom the [Bu- reau of Narcotics] has obtained results of orwrational value through the tests. On the other hand, the effectiveness of the substances on individuals at all social levels, high and low, native American and foreign, is of great significance and testing has been performed an a variety of individuals within these categories. [Emphasis added.] 16 A special procedure. designated MKDELTA, was es'ablished to govern the use of MKULTRA materials abrond. Such materials were used on a number of occasions. Because MKULTRA records were dostroved, it is imnossible to reconstruct the operational use of MKULTRA materials by the CIA overseas; it has been determined that the use of these materials abroad began in 1953, and possibly as early as 1950. Druns were used primarily as an aid to interrogations. but MKULTRA/MKDELTA materials were also used for harassment, discrediting, or disabling purposes. According to an Inspector General Survey of the Technical Services Division of the CIA in 1957-an inspection which did not discover the MKULTRA oroject involving the surreptitious administration of LSD to unwitting, nonvolunteer SIbid, p. 21. * Ibid., pp. 11-12. 72 392 subjects-the CIA had developed six drugs for operational use and they had been used in six different operations on a total of thirty-three subjects.' By 1963 the number of operations and subjects had in- creased substantially. In the spring of 1963, during a wide-ranging Inspector General survey of the Technical Services Division, a member of the Inspector General's staff, John Vance, learned about MKULTRA and about the project involving the surreptitious administration of LSD to un- witting, nonvoluntary human subjects. As a result. of the discovery and the Inspector General's subsequent -report, this testing was halted and much tighter administrative controls were imposed on the pro- gram. According to the CIA, the project was decreased significantly each budget year until its complete termination in the late 1960s. 5. The Testing of LSD by the Army There were three major phases in the Army's testing of LSD. In the first, LSD was administered to more than 1,000 American soldiers who volunteered to be subjects in chemical warfare experiments. In the second phase, Material Testing Program EA 1729, 95 volunteers re- ceived LSD in clinical experiments designed to evaluate potential intelligence uses of the drug. In the third phase, Projects THIRD CHANCE and DERBY HAT, 16 unwitting nonvolunteer subjects were interrogated after receiving LSD as part of operational field tests. B. CIA DRUG TESTING PROGRAMS 1. The Rationale for the Testing Programs The late 1940s and early 1950s were marked by concern over the threat posed by the activities of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other Communist bloc countries. United States concern over the use of chemical and biological agents by these powers was acute. The belief that hostile powers had used chemical and bio- logical agents in interrogations, brainwashing, and in attacks designed to harass, disable, or kill Allied personnel created considerable pres- sure for a "defensive" program to investigate chemical and biological agents so that the intelligence community could understand the mech- anisms by which these substances worked and how their effects could be defeated.," Of particular concern was the drug LSD. The CIA had received reports that the Soviet Union was engaged in intensive efforts to pro- duce LSD; and that the Soviet Union had attempted to purchase the world's supply of the chemical. As one CIA officer who was deeply involved in work with this drug described the climate of the times: "[It] is awfully hard in this day and age to reproduce how frightening all of this was to us at the time, particularly after the drug scene has become as widespread and as knowledgeable in this country as it did. But we were literally terrified, because this was the one material that we Ibid, 1957, p. 201. sThus an officer in the Office of Security of the CIA stressed the "urgency of the discovery of techniques and method that would permit our personnel, in the event of their capture by the enemy, to resist or defeat enemy interrogation." (Minutes of the ARTICHOKE conference of 10/22/53.) 393 had ever been able to locate that really had potential fantastic possi- bilities if used wrongly." 19 But the defensive orientation soon became secondary. Chemical and biological agents were to be studied in order "to perfect techniques . . . for the abstraction of information from individuals whether willing or not" and in order to "develop means for the control of the activities and mental capacities of individuals whether willing or not." 20 One Agency official noted that drugs would be useful in order to "gain con- trol of bodies whether they were willing or not" in the process of re- moving personnel from Europe in the event of a Soviet attack.21 In other programs, the CIA began to develop, produce, stockpile, and maintain in operational readiness materials which could be used to harass, disable, or kill specific targets. 22 Reports of research and development in the Soviet Union, the Peo- ple's Republic of China, and the Communist Bloc countries provided the basis for the transmutation of American programs from a defen- sive to an offensive orientation. As the Chief of the Medical Staff of the Central Intelligence Agency wrote in 1952: There is ample evidence in the reports of innumerable inter- rogations that the Communists were utilizing drugs, physical duress, electric shock, and possibly hypnosis against their ene- mies. With such evidence it is difficult not to keep from be- coming rabid about our apparent laxity. We are forced by this mounting evidence to assume a more aggressive role in the development of these techniques, but must be cautious to maintain strict inviolable control because of the havoc that could be wrought by such techniques in unscrupulous hands. 23 In order to meet the perceived threat to the national security, sub- stantial programs for the testing and use of chemical and biological agents-including projects involving the surreptitious administra- tion of LSD to unwitting nonvolunteer subjects "at all social levels, high and low, native American and foreign"-were conceived, and implemented. These programs resulted in substantial violations of the rights of individuals within the United States. 1 Testimony of CIA officer, 11/21/75, p. 33. '0 Memorandum from the Director of Security to ARTICHOKE representa- tives, Subject: "ARTICHOKE Restatement of Program." n ARTICHOKE memorandum, 7/30/53. " The Inspector General's Report of 1957 on the Technical Services Division noted that "Six specific products have been developed and are available for oper- ational use. Three of them are discrediting and disabling materials which can be administered unwittingly and permit the exercise of a measure of control over the actions of the subject." A memorandum for the Chief, TSD, Biological Branch to the Chief, TSD, 10/18/67, described two of the objectives of the CIA's Project MKNAOMI as: "to stockpile severely incapacitating and lethal materials for the specific use of TSD" and "to maintain in operational readiness special and unique items for the dissemination of biological and chemical materals." ' Memorandum from the Chief of the Medical Staff, 1/25/52. 394 Although the CIA recognized these effects of LSD to unwitting in- dividuals within the United States, the project continued.2 4 As the Deputy Director for Plans, Richard Helms, wrote the Deputy Direc- tor of Central Intelligence during discussions which led to the cessa- tion of unwitting testing: While I share your uneasiness and distaste for any pro- gram which tends to intrude upon an individual's private and legal prerogatives, I believe it is necessary that the Agency maintain a central role in this activity, keep current on enemy capabilities the manipulation of human behavior, and maintain an offensive capability. 25 There were no attempts to secure approval for the most controversial aspects of these programs from the executive branch or Congress. The nature and extent of the programs were closely held secrets; even DCI McCone was not briefed on all the details of the program in- volving the surreptitious administration of LSD until 1963. It was deemed imperative that these programs be concealed from the Ameri- can people. As the CIA's Inspector General wrote in 1957: Precautions must be taken not only to protect operations from exposure to enemyeforces but also to conceal these ac- tivities from the American public in general. The knowledge that the Agency is engaging in unethical and illicit activities would have serious repercussions in political and diplomatic circles and would be detrimental to the accomplishment of its mission.26 2. The Death of Dr. Frank Olson The most tragic result of the testing of LSD by the CIA was the death of Dr. Frank Olson, a civilian employee of the Army, who died on November 27, 1953. His death followed his participation in a CIA experiment with LSD. As part of this experiment, Olson unwittingly received approximately 70 micrograms of LSD in a glass of Cointreau he drank on November 19, 1953. The drug had been placed in the bottle by a CIA officer, Dr. Robert Lashbrook, as part of an experiment he and Dr. Sidney Gottlieb performed at a meeting of Army and CIA scientists. Shortly after this experiment, Olson exhibited symptoms of para- noia and schizophrenia. Accompanied by Dr. Lashbrook, Olson sought psychiatric assistance in New York City from a physician, Dr. Harold Abramson, whose research on LSD had been funded indirectly by the CIA. While in New York for treatment, Olson fell to his death from a tenth story window in the Statler Hotel. *" Even during the discussions which led to the termination of the unwitting testing, the DDP turned down the option of halting such tests within the U.S. and continuing them abroad despite the fact that the Technical Services Divi- sion had conducted numerous operations abroad making use of LSD. The DDP made this decision on the basis of security noting that the past efforts overseas had resulted in "making an inordinate number of foreign nationals witting of our role in the very sensitive activity." (Memorandum for the Deputy Director of Central Intelligence from the Deputy Director for Plans, 12/17/63, p. 2.) '5 Ibid., pp. 2-3. 2 I.G. survey of TSD, 1957, p. 217. 395 a. Background.-Olson, an expert in aerobiology who was assigned to the Special Operations Division (SOD) of the U.S. Army Biolog- ical Center at Camp Detrick, Maryland. This Division had three primary functions (1) assessing the vulnerability of American installations to biological attack; (2) developing techniques for offensive use of biological weapons; and (3) biological research for the CIA. 2 7 Professionally, Olson was well respected by his colleagues in both the Army and the CIA. Colonel Vincent Ruwet, Olson's immediate superior at the time of his death, was in almost daily contact with Olson. According to Colonel Ruwet: "As a professional man . . . his ability . . . was outstanding." 28 Colonel Ruwet stated that "during the period prior to the experiment . . . I noticed nothing which would lead me to believe that he was of unsound mind." " Dr. Lash- brook, who had monthly contacts with Olson from early 1952 until the time of his death, stated publicly that before Olson received LSD, "as far as I know, he was perfectly normal." 30 This assessment is in direct contradiction to certain statements evaluating Olson's emo- tional stability made in CIA internal memoranda written after Olson's death. b. The Experiment.-On November 18, 1953, a group of ten scien- tists fiom the CIA and Camp Detrick attended a semi-annual review and analysis conference at a cabin located at Deep Creek Lake, Mary- land. Three of the participants were from the CIA's Technical Serv- ices Staff. The Detrick representatives were all from the Special Operations Division. According to one CIA official, the Special Operations Division participants "agreed that an unwitting experiment would be desirable." "3 This account directly contradicts Vincent Ruwet's recol- lection. Ruwet recalls no such discussion, and has asserted that he would remember any such discussion because the SOD participants would have strenuously objected to testing on unwitting subjects.3 2 In May, 1953, Richard Helms, Assistant DDP, held a staff meeting which the Chief of Technical Services Staff attended. At this meeting Helms "indicated that the drug [LSD] was dynamite and that he should be advised at all times when it was intended to use it." 3 In addition, the then DDP, Frank Wisner, sent a memorandum to TSS stating the requirement that the DDP personally approve the use of LSD. Gottlieb went ahead with the experiment,34 securing the ap- 27 Staff summary of Vincent Ruwet Interview, 8/13/75, p. 3. " Memorandum of Col. Vincent Ruwet, To Whom It May Concern, no date, p. 2.

Neither the Chief of TSS nor the DDP specifically authorized the experiment in which Dr. Olson participated.35 According to Gottlieb.3 6 a "very small dose" of LSD was placed in a bottle of Cointreau which was served after dinner on Thursday, November 19. The drug was placed in the liqueur by Robert Lash- brook. All but two of the SOD participants received LSD. One did not drink; the other had a heart condition.3 7 About twenty minutes after they finished their Cointreau, Gottlieb informed the other par- ticipants that they had received LSD. Dr. Gottlieb stated that "up to the time of the experiment," he observed nothing unusual in Olson's behavior.37a Once the experiment was underway, Gottlieb recalled that "the drug had a definite effect on the group to the point that they were boisterous and laughing and they could not continue the meeting or engage in sensible conversation." The meeting continued until about 1:00 a.m., when the participants retired for the evening. Gottlieb recalled that Olson, among others, complained of "wakefulness" during the night.3 8 According to Gottlieb on Friday morning "aside from some evidence of fatigue, I observed nothing unusual in [Olson's] actions, conversation, or general be- havior." 39 Ruwet recalls that Olson "appeared to be agitated" at breakfast, but that he "did not consider this to be abnormal under the circumstances." 40 c. The Treatment.-The following Monday, November 23, Olson was waiting for Ruwet when he came in to work at 7:30 a.m. For the next two days Olson's friends and family attempted to reassure hin and help him "snap out" of what appeared to be a serious depression. On Tuesday, Olson again came to Ruwet and, after an hour long con- Dr. Gottlieb testified that "given the information we knew up to this time, and based on a lot of our own self-administration, we thought it was a fairly benign substance in terms of potential harm." This is in conflict not only with 'Mr. Helms' statement but also with material which had been supplied to the Technical Services Staff. In one long memorandum on current research with LSD which was supplied to TSD, Henry Beecher described the dangers involved with such research in a prophetic manner. "The second reason to doubt Professor Rothland came when I raised the question as to any accidents which had arisen from the use of LSD-25. He said in a very positive way, 'none.' As it turned out this answer could be called overly positive, for later on in the evening I was discussing the matter with Dr. W. A. Stohl, Jr., a psychiatrist in Bleulera's Clinic in Zurich where I had gone at Rothland's insistence. Stohl, when asked the same question, replied, 'yes,' and added spontaneously, 'there is a case Professor Rothland knows about. In Geneva a woman physician who had been subject to depression to some extent took LSD-25 in an experiment and became severely and suddenly depressed and committed suicide three weeks later. While the connection is not definite, common knowledge of this could hardly have allowed the positive statement Rothland permitted himself. This case is a warning to us to avoid engaging subjects who are depressed, or who have been subject to depression.' " Dr. Gottlieb testified that he had no recollection of either the report or that particular section of it. (Sidney Gottlieb testimony, 10/19/75, p. 78.) " Memorandum of Sheffield Edwards for the record, 11/28/53, p. 2. ' Lashbrook (staff summary), 7/19/75, p. 3. "a Gottlieb Memorandum, 12/7/53, p. 2. Edwards memorandum, 11/28/53, p. 3.

'0 Ruwet memorandum, p. 3. 397 versation, it was decided that medical assistance for Dr. Olson was desirable."1 Ruwet then called Lashbrook and informed him that "Dr. Olson was in serious trouble and needed immediate professional attention." 42 Lashbrook agreed to make appropriate arrangements and told Ruwet to bring Olson to Washington, D.C. Ruwet and Olson proceeded to Washington to meet with Lashbrook, and the three left for New York at about 2:30 p.m. to meet with Dr. Harold Abramson. At that time Dr. Abramson was an allergist and immunologist practicing medicine in New York City. He held no degree in psychia- try, but was associated with research projects supported indirectly by the CIA. Gottlieb and Dr. Lashbrook both followed his work closely in the early 1950s. 4 3 Since Olson needed medical help, they turned to Dr. Abramson as the doctor closest to Washington who was experi- enced with LSD and cleared by the CIA. Ruwet, Lashbrook, and Olson remained in New York for two days of consultations with Abramson. On Thursday, November 26, 1953, the three flew back to Washington so that Olson could spend Thanksgiving with his family. En route from the airport Olson told Ruwet that he was afraid to face his family. After a lengthy discussion, it was de- cided that Olson and Lashbrook would return to New York, and that Ruwet would go to Frederick to explain these events to Mrs. Olson ." Lashbrook and Olson flew back to New York the same day, again for consultations with Abramson. They spent Thursday night in a Long Island hotel and the next morning returned to the city with Abramson. In further discussions with Abramson, it was agreed that Olson should be placed under regular psychiatric care at an institution closer to his home.4 5 d. The Death.-Because they could not obtain air transportation for a return trip on Friday night, Lashbrook and Olson made reservations for Saturday morning and checked into the Statler Hotel. Between the time they checked in and 10:00 p.m.; they watched television, visited the cocktail lounge, where each had two martinis, and dinner. According to Lashbrook, Olson "was cheerful and appeared to enjoy the entertainment." He "appeared no longer particulary depressed, and almost the Dr. Olson I knew prior to the experiment." 46 After dinner Lashbrook and Olson watched television for about an hour, and at 11:00, Olson suggested that they go to bed, saying that "he felt more relaxed and contented than he had since [they] came to New York." " Olson then left a call with the hotel operator to wake them in the morning. At approximately 2:30 a.m. Saturday, Novem- ber 28, Lashbrook was awakened by a loud "crash of glass." In his report on the incident, he stated only that Olson "had crashed through the closed window blind and the closed window and he fell to his death from the window of our room on the 10th floor." 48 "Ibid., p. 4.

Lashbrook called Abramson and informed him of the occurrence. Abramson told Lash- brook he "wanted to be kept out of the thing completely," but later changed his mind and agreed to assist Lashbrook.5' Shortly thereafter, uniformed police officers and some hotel em- ployees came to Lashbrook's room. Lashbrook told the police he didn't know why Olson had committed suicide, but he did know that Olson "suffered from ulcers." 65 e. The Aftermath.-Following Dr. Olson's death, the CIA made a substantial effort to ensure that his family received death benefits, but did not notify the Olsons of the circumstances surrounding his demise. The Agency also made considerable efforts to prevent the death being connected with the CIA, and supplied complete cover for Lashbrook so that his association with the CIA would remain a secret. After Dr. Olson's death the CIA conducted an internal investiga- tion of the incident. As part of his responsibilities in this investiga- tion, the General Counsel wrote the Inspector General, stating: I'm not happy with what seems to be a very casual attitude on the part of TSS representatives to the way this experi- ment was conducted and the remarks that this is just one of the risks running with scientific experimentation. I do not eliminate the need for taking risks, but I do believe, espe- cially when human health or life is at stake, that at least the prudent, reasonable measures which can be taken to mini- . mize the risk must be taken and failure to do so was culpable negligence. The actions of the various individuals concerned after effects of the experiment on Dr. Olson became manifest also revealed the failure to observe normal and reasonable precautions." As a result of the investigation DCI Allen Dulles sent a personal letter to the Chief of Technical Oneiations of the Technical Services Staff who had approved the experiment criticizing him for "poor judgment... in authorizing the use of this drug on such an unwitting basis and without proximate medical safeguards." 54 Dulles also sent a letter to Dr. Gotilieb, Chief of the Chemical Division of the Tech- ifiical Services Staff, criticizing him for recommending the "unwitting application of the drug" in that the proposal "did not give sufficient emphasis for medical collaboration and for the proper consideration of the rights of the individual to whom it was being administered."

Although the letters were critical, a note from the Deputy Director of Central Intelligence to Mr. Helms instructed him to in- form the individuals that: "These are not reprimands and no person- nel file notation are being made." 5 Thus, although the Rockefeller Commission has characterized them as such, these notes were explicitly not reprimands. Nor did participa- tion in the events which led to Dr. Olson's death have any apparent effect on the advancement within the CIA of the individuals involved. 3. The Surreptitious Administration of LSD to Unwitting Non- Volunteer Human Subjects by the CIA After the Death of Dr. Olson The death of Dr. Olson could be viewed, as some argued at the time, as a tragic accident, one of the risks inherent in the testing of new sub- stances. It might be argued that LSD was thought to be benign. After the death of Dr. Olson the dangers of the surreptitious admin- istration of LSD were clear, yet the CIA continued or initiated 11 a project involving the surreptitious administration of LSD to non- volunteer human subjects. This program exposed numerous individuals in the United States to the risk of death or serious injury without their informed consent, without medical supervision, and without necessary follow-up to determine any long-term effects. Prior to the Olson experiment, the Director of Central Intelligence had approved MKULTRA, a research program designed to develop a "capability in the covert use of biological and chemical agent materials." In the proposal describing MKULTRA Mr. Helms, then ADDP, wrote the Director that: we intend to investigate the development of a chemical mate- rial which causes a reversible non-toxic aberrant mental state, the specific nature of which can be reasonably well predicted for each individual. This material could potentially aid in discrediting individuals, eliciting information, and implant- ing suggestions and other forms of mental control.5s On February 12, 1954, the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency wrote TSS officials criticizing them for "poor judgment" in administering LSD on "an unwitting basis and without proximate medical safeguards" to Dr. Olson and for the lack of "proper consid- eration of the rights of the individual to whom it was being admin- istered." 59 On the same day, the Inspector General reviewed a report on Subproject Number 3 of MKULTRA, in which the same TSS officers who had just received letters from the Director were quoted as stating that one of the purposes of Subproject Number 3 was to 6 Note from DDCI to Richard Helms, 2/13/54. " The 1963 IG Report, which described the project involving the surreptitious administration of LSD, placed the project beginning in 1955. Other CIA docu- ments reveal that it was in existence as early as February 1954. The CIA has told the Committee that the project began in 1953 and that the experiment which led to Dr. Olson's death was part of the project. " Memorandum from ADDP items to DOI Dulles, 4/3/53, tab A, p. 2. 0 Memorandum from DCI to Sidney Gottlieb, 2/12/54; and memorandum from DCI to Chief of Operations, TSS, 2/12/54. 400 "observe the behavior of unwitting persons being questioned after having been given a drug." o There is no evidence that Subproject Number 3 was terminated even though these officers were unequivo- cally aware of the dangers of the surreptitious administration of LSD and the necessity of obtaining informed consent and providing medical safeguards. Subproject Number 3, in fact, used methods which showed even less concern than did the OLSON experiment for the safety and security of the participants. Yet the evidence indicates the project continued until 1963.61 In the project, the individual conducting the test might make initial contact with a prospective subject selected at random in a bar. He would then invite the person to a "safehouse" where the test drug was administered to the subject through drink or in food. CIA per- sonnel might debrief the individual conducting the test, or observe the test by using a one-way mirror and tape recorder in an adjoining room. Prior consent was obviously not obtained from any of the subjects. There was also, obviously, no medical prescreening. In addition, the tests were conducted by individuals who were not qualified scientific observers. There were no medical personnel on hand either to admin- ister the drugs or to observe their effects, and no follow-up was con- ducted on the test subjects. As the Inspector General noted in 1963: A significant limitation on the effectiveness of such testing is the infeasibility of performing scientific observation of re- sults. The [individuals conducting the test] are not qualified scientific observers. Their subjects are seldom accessible be- yond the first hours of the test. The testing may be useful in perfecting delivery techniques, and in identifying surface characteristics of onset, reaction, attribution, and side-effect. 62 This was particularly troublesome as in a number of instances, . . . the test subject has become ill for hours or days, including hospitalization in at least one case, and the agent could only follow up by guarded inquiry after the test subject's return to normal life. Possible sickness and attendant economic loss are inherent contingent effects of the testing. 6 3 Paradoxically, greater care seems to have been taken for the safety of foreign nationals against whom LSD was used abroad. In several cases medical examinations were performed prior to the use of LSD. 64 0 Memorandum to Inspector General from Chief, Inspection and Review, on Subproject #3 of MKULTRA, 2/10/54.

A physi- 401 Moreover, the administration abroad was marked -by constant obser- vation made possible because the material was being used against prisoners of foreign intelligence or security organizations. Finally, during certain of the LSD interrogations abroad, local physicians were on call, though these physicians had had no experience with LSD and would not be told that hallucinogens had been administered. 6 5 The CIA's project involving the surreptitious administration of LSD to unwitting human subjects in the United States was finally halted in 1963, as a result of its discovery during the course of an Inspector General survey of the Technical Services Division. When the Inspector General learned of the project, he spoke to the Deputy Director for Plans, who agreed that the Director should be briefed. The DDP made it clear that the DCI and his Deputy were generally familiar with MKULTRA. He indicated, however, that he, was not sure it was necessary to brief the DDCI at that point. On May 24, 1963, the DDP advised the Inspector General that he had briefed the Director on the MKULTRA program and in particular had covered the question of the surreptitious administration of LSD to unwitting human subjects. According to the Inspector General, the DDP said that "the Director indicated no disagreement and therefore the 'testing' will continue." 66 One copy of an "Eyes Only" draft report on MKULTRA was prepared by the Inspector General who recommended the termination of the surreptitious administration project. The project was suspended following the Inspector General's report. On December 17, 1963, Deputy Director for Plans Helms wrote a memo to the DDCI, who with the Inspector General and the Executive Director-Comptroller had opposed the covert testing. He noted two aspects of the problem: (1) "for over a decade the Clandestine Serv- ices has had the mission of maintaining a capability for influencing human behavior;" and (2) "testing arrangements in furtherance of this mission should be as operationally realistic and yet as controllable as possible." Helms argued that the individuals must be "unwitting" as this was "the only realistic method of maintaining the capability, considering the intended operational use of materials to influence human behavior as the operational targets will certainly be unwitting. Should the subjects of the testing not be unwitting, the program would only be "pro forma" resulting in a "false sense of accomplishment and readiness." 67 Helms continued: clan need not be present. There is no danger medically in the use of this material as handled by TSS trained personnel." The Office of Medical Services had taken the position that LSD was "medically dangerous." Both the Office of Security and the Office of Medical Services argued that LSD "should not be administered unless preceded by a medical examination .. . and should be administered only by or in the presence of a physician who had studied it and its effect." (Memo- randum from James Angleton, Chief, Counterintelligence Staff to Chief of Oper- ations, 12/12/57, pp. 1-2. * Physicians might be called with the hope that they would make a diagnosis of mental breakdown which would be useful in discrediting the individual who was the subject of the CIA interest. " Memorandum for the Record prepared by the Inspector General, 5/15/63, p. 1. 6 Ibid., p. 2. 402 If one grants the validity of the mission of maintaining this unusual capability and the necessity for unwitting testing, there is only then the question of how best to do it. Obviously, the testing should be conducted in such a manner as to permit the opportunity to observe the results of the administration on the target. It also goes without saying that whatever test- ing arrangement we adopt must afford maximum safeguards for the protection of the Agency's role in this activity, as well as minimizing the possibility of physical or emotional damage to the individual tested. 68 In another memo to the Director of Central Intelligence in June, 1964, Helms again raised the issue of unwitting testing. At that time General Carter, then acting DCI, approved several changes in the MKTULTRA program proposed by Mr. Helms as a result of negotia- tions between the Inspector General and the DDP. In a handwritten note, however, Director Carter added that "unwitting testing will be subject to a separate decision." 69. No specific decision was made then or soon after. The testing had been halted and, according to Walter Elder, Executive Assistant to DCI McCone, the DCI was not inclined to take the positive step of authorizing a resumption of the testing. At least through the summer, the DDP did not press the issue. On November 9, 1964, the DDP raised the issue again in a memo to the DCI, calling the Director's attention to what he described as "several other indications during the past year of an apparent Soviet aggressiveness in the field of covertly administered chemicals which are, to say the least, inexplic- able and disturbing." o Helms noted that because of the suspension of covert testing, the Akgency's "positive operational capability to use drugs is diminishing, owing to a lack of realistic testing. With increasing knowledge of the state of the art, we are less capable of staying up with Soviet advances in this field. This in turn results in a waning capability on our part to restrain others in the intelligence community (such as the Depart- ment of Defense) from pursuing operations in this area." " Helms attributed the cessation of the unwitting testing to the high risk of embarrassment to the Agency as well as the "moral problem." He noted that no better covert situation had been devised than that which had been used, and that "we have no answer to the moral issue." 72 Helms asked for either resumption of the testing project or its defini- tive cancellation. He argued that the status quo of a research and de- velopment program without a realistic testing program was causing the Agency to live "with the illusion of a capability which is becoming minimal and furthermore is expensive." "7 Once again no formal action was taken in response to the Helms' request.

From its beginning in the early 1950's until its termination in 1963, the program of surreptitious administration of LSD to unwitting non- volunteer human subjects demonstrates a failure of the CIA's leader- ship to pay adequate attention to the rights of individuals and to pro- vide effective guidance to CIA employees. Though it was known that the testing was dangerous, the lives of subjects were placed in jeop- ardy and their rights were ignored during the ten years of testing which followed Dr. Olson's death. Although it was clear that the laws of the United States were being violated, the testing continued. While the individuals involved in the Olson experiment were admonished by the Director, at the same time they were also told that they were not being reprimanded and that their "bad judgment" would not be made part of their personnel records. When the covert testing project was terminated in 1963, none of the individuals involved were subject to any disciplinary action. 4. Monitoring and Control of the Testing and Use of-Chemical and Biological Agents by the CIA The Select Committee found numerous failures in the monitoring and control of the testing and use of chemical and 'biological agents within the CIA.74 An analysis of the failures can be divided into four sections: (a) the waiver of normal regulations or requirements; (b) the problems in authorization procedures; (c) the failure of internal review mechanisms such as the Office of General Counsel, the Inspector General, and the Audit Staff; and (d) the effect of compartmentation and competition within the CIA. a. The Waiver of Administrative Control.-The internal controls within any agency rest on: (1) clear and coherent regulations; (2) clear lines of authority; and (3) clear rewards for those who conduct themselves in accord with agency regulations and understandable and immediate sanctions against those who do not. In the case of the test- ing and use of chemical and biological agents, normal CIA adminis- trative controls were waived. The destruction of the documents on the largest CIA program in this area constituted a prominent example of the waiver of normal Agency procedures by the Director. These documents were destroyed in early 1973 at the order of then DCI Richard Helms. According to Helms, Dr. Sidney Gottlieb, then Director of TSD: ... came to me and said that he was retiring and that I was retiring and he thought it would be a good idea if these files were destroyed. And I also believe part of the reason for our thinking this was advisable was there had been relation- ships with outsiders in government agencies and other orga- nizations and that these would be sensitive in this kind of a thing but that since the program was over and finished and done with, we thought we would just get rid of the files as "Section 2(9) of S. Res. 21 instructs the Committee to examine: the "extent to which United States intelligence agencies are governed by Executive Orders, rules, or regulations either published or secret." 84 404 well, so that anybody who assisted us in the past would not be subject to follow-up or questions, embarrassment, if you will." The destruction was based on a waiver of an internal CIA regula- tion, CSI 70-10, which regulated the "retirement of inactive records." As Thomas Karamessines, then Deputy Director of Plans, wrote in regulation CSI-70-10: "Retirement is not a matter of convenience or of storage but of conscious judgment in the application of the rules modified by knowledge of individual component needs. The heart of this judgment is to ensure that the complete story can be reconstructed in later years and by people who may be unfamiliar with the events." " The destruction of the MKULTRA documents made it impossible for the Select Committee to determine the full range and extent of the largest CIA research program involving chemical and biological agents. The destruction also prevented the CIA from locating and pro- viding medical assistance to the individuals who were subjects in the program. Finally, it prevented the Committee from determining the full extent of the operations which made use of materials developed in the MKULTRA program.7 7 From the inception of MKULTRA normal Agency procedures were waived. In 1953, Mr. Helms, then Assistant Deputy Director for Plans, proposed the establishment of MKULTRA. Under the proposal six percent of the research and development budget of TSD would be expended "without the establishment of formal contractual relations" because contracts would reveal government interest. Helms also voted that qualified individuals in the field "are most reluctant to enter into signed agreements of any sort which connect them with this activity since such a connection would jeopardize their professional reputa- " Richard Helms testimony, 9/11/75, p. 5. 'Many Agency documents recording confidential relationships with individuals and organizations are retained without public disclosure. Moreover, in the case of MKULTRA the CIA had spent millions of dollars developing both materials and delivery systems which could be used by the Clandestine Services; the reconstruc- tion of the research and development program would be difficult if not impos- sible, without the documents, and at least one assistant to Dr. Gottlieb protested against the document destruction on those grounds. " Clandestine Services Institution (CSI) 70-10. When asked by the Select Committee about the regularity of the procedure by which he authorized Dr. Gottlieb to destroy the MKULTRA records, Helms responded: "Well, that's hard to say whether it would be part of the regular procedure or not, because the record destruction program is conducted according to a certain pattern. There's a regular record destruction pattern in the Agency monitored by certain people and done a certain way. So that anything outside of that, I suppose, would have been unusual. In other words, there were documents being destroyed because somebody had raised this specific issue rather than because they were encompassed in the regular records destruction program. So I think the answer to your question is probably yes." (Helms testimony, 9/11/75, p. 6.) 7 Even prior to the destruction of documents, the MKULTRA records were far from complete. As the Inspector General noted in 1963: "Files are notably incomplete, poorly organized, and lacking in evaluative state- ments that might give perspective to management policies over time. A substan- tial portion of the MKULTRA record appears to rest in the memories of the prin- cipal officers and is therefore almost certain to be lost with their departures." (G Report on MKULTRA, p. 23.) 405 tions"."8 Other Agency procedures, i.e., the forwarding of documents in support of invoices and the provision for regular audit procedures, were also to be waived. On April 13, 1953, then DCI Allen Dulles approved MKULTRA, noting that security considerations precluded handling the project through usual contractual agreements. Ten years later investigations of MKULTRA by both the Inspector General and the Audit Staff noted substantial deficiencies which re- sulted from the waivers. Because TSD had not reserved the right to audit the books of contractors in MKULTRA, the CIA had been unable to verify the use of Agency grants by a contractor. Another firm had failed to establish controls and safeguards which would as- sure "proper accountability" in use of government funds with the result that "funds have been used for purposes not contemplated by grants or allowable under usual contract relationship." " The entire MKULTRA arrangement was condemned for having administrative lines which were unclear, overly permissive controls, and irrespon- sible supervision. The head of the Audit Branch noted that inspections and audits: led us to see MKULTRA as frequently having provided a device to escape normal administrative controls for research that is not especially sensitive, as having allowed practices that produce gross administrative failures, as having per- mitted the establishment of special relationships with unreli- able organizations on an unacceptable basis, and as having produced, on at least one occasion, a cavalier treatment of a bona fide contracting organization. While admitting that there may be a need for special mechanisms for handling sensitive projects, the Chief of the Audit Branch wrote that "both the terms of reference and the ground rules for handling such special projects should be spelled out in advance so that diver- sion from normal channels does not mean abandonment of controls. Special procedures may be necessary to ensure the security of highly sensitive operations. To prevent the erosion of normal internal con- trol mechanisms, such waivers should not be extended to less sensitive operations. Moreover, only those regulations which would endanger security should be waived; to waive regulations generally would result in highly sensitive and controversial projects having looser rather than stricter administrative controls. MKNAOMI, the Fort Detrick CIA project for research and development of chemical and biological agents, provides another example where efforts to protect the security of agency activties overwhelmed administrative controls. No written records of the transfer of agents such as anthrax or shell- fish toxin were kept, "because of the sensitivity of the area and the desire to keep any possible use of materials like this recordless." 81 The 11 Memorandum from ADDP Helms to DCI Dulles, 4/3/53, Tab. A, p. 2. - Memorandum from IG to Chief, TSD, 11/8/63, as quoted in memorandum from Chief, Audit Branch. ' The memorandum suggested that administrative exclusions, because of the importance of such decisions, should require the personal approval of the Deputy Director of Central Intelligence on an inidividual case basis. Present CIA policy is that only the DCI can authorize certain exemptions from regulations. sx Sidney Gottlieb testimony, 10/18/75, Hearings, Vol. 1, p. 51. 86 406 result was that the Agency had no way of determining what mate- rials were on hand, and could not be certain whether delivery systems such as dart guns, or deadly substances such as cobra venom had been issued to the field. b. Authorization.-The destruction of the documents regarding MKULTRA made it difficult to determine at what level specific proj- ects in the program were authorized. This problem is not solely a re- sult of the document destruction, however. Even at the height of MKULTRA the IG noted that, at least with respect to the surrepti- tious administration of LSD, the "present practice is to maintain no records of the planning and approval of test programs." 82 While it is clear that Allen Dulles authorized MiKULTRA, the rec- ord is unclear as to who authorized specific projects such as that in- volving the surreptitious administration of LSD to unwitting non- volunteer human subjects. Even given the sensitive and controversial nature of the project, there is no evidence that when John McCone replaced Allen Dulles as the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency he was briefed on the details of this project and asked whether it should be continued."3 Even during the 1963 discussions on the pro- priety of unwitting testing, the DDP questioned whether it was "neces- sary to brief General Carter," the Deputy Director of Central Intelli- gence and the Director's "alter ago," because CIA officers felt it neces- sary to keep details of the project restricted to an absolute minimum number of people. 4 In May of 1963, DDP Helms told the Inspector General that the covert testing program was authorized because he had gone to the Director, briefed him on it and "the Director indicated no disagree- ment and therefore the testing will continue." 85 Such authorization even for noncontroversial matters is clearly less desirable than ex- plicit authorization; in areas such as the surreptitious administration of drugs, it is particularly undesirable. Yet according to testimony 2 IG Report on MKULTRA, 1963, p. 14. " According to an assistant to Dr. Gottlieb, there were annual briefings of the DCI and the DDP on MKULTRA by the Chief of TSD or his deputy. However, a May 15, 1963 Memorandum for the Record from the Inspector General noted that Mr. McCone had not been briefed in detail about the program. Mr. McCone's Exec- utive Officer, Walter Elder, testified that it was "perfectly apparent to me" that neither Mr. McCone nor General Carter, then the DDCI, was aware of the sur- reptitious administration project "or if they had been briefed they had not under- stood it." (Elder, 12/18/75, p. 13.) Mr. McCone testified that he "did not know" whether he talked to anyone about the project but that no one had told him about it in a way that "would have turned on all the lights." (John McCone testimony, 2/3/76, p. 10.) " According to Elder's testimony, "no Deputy Director, to my knowledge, has ever been briefed or was it ever thought necessary to brief them to the extent to which you would brief the Director." " IG Memorandum for the Record. 5/15/63. On the question of authorization of the covert testing program, Elder testified as follows: "But my reasonable judgment is that this was considered to be in the area of continuing approval, having once been approved by the Director." The theory of authorization carrying over from one administration to the next seems particularly inappropriate for less visible, highly sensitive operations which, unless brought to his attention by subordinates, would not come to the attention of the Director. 87 407 before the Committee, authorization through lack of agreement -is even more prevalent in sensitive situations." * The unauthorized retention of shellfish toxin by Dr. Nathan Gordon and his subordinates, in violation of a Presidential Directive, may have resulted from the failure of the Director to issue written instructions to Agency officials. The retention was not authorized by senior officials in the Agency. The Director, Mr. Helms, had instructed Mr. Karames- sines, the Deputy Director of Plans, and Dr. Gottlieb, the Chief of Technical Services Division, to relinquish control to the Army of any chemical or biological agents being retained for the CIA at Fort De- trick. Dr. Gottlieb passed this instruction on to Dr. Gordon. While orders may be disregarded in any organization, one of the reasons that Dr. Gordon used to defend the retention was the fact that he had not received written instructions forbidding it.87 In some situations the existence of written instructions did not pre- vent unauthorized actions. According to an investigation by the CIA's Inspector General TSD officers had been informed orally that Mr. Helns was to be "advised at all times" when LSD was to be used. In addition TSD had received a memo advising the staff that LSD was not to be used without the permission of the DDP, Frank Wisner. The experiment involving Dr. Olson went ahead without notification of either Mr. Wisner or Mr. Helms. The absence of clear and immediate punishment for that act must undercut the force of other internal in- structions and regulations. One last issue must be raised about authorization procedures within the Agency. Chemical agents were used abroad until 1959 for dis- crediting or disabling operations, or for the purpose of interrogations with the approval of the Chief of Operations of the DDP. Later the approval of the Deputy Director for Plans was required for such operations. Although the medical staff sought to be part of the ap- proval process for these operations, they were excluded because, as the Inspector General wrote in 1957: Operational determinations are the responsibility of the DD/P and it is he who should advise the DCI in these respects just as it is he who is responsible for the results. It is completely unrealistic to consider assigning to the Chief, Medical Staff, (what, in effect, would be authority over clan- destine operations.)" Given the expertise and training of physicians, participation of the Medical Staff might well have been useful. Questions about authorization also exist in regard to those agencies which assisted the CIA. For instance, the project involving the sur- reptitious administration of LSD to unwitting non-volunteer human subjects was conducted in coordination with the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs. There is some question as to the Commissioner of Narcotics' knowledge about the project. a Mr. Elder was asked whether the process of bringing forward a description of actions by the Agency in getting approval through the absence of disagreement was a common one. He responded, "It was not uncommon. . . . The more sensitive the project the more likely it would lean toward being a common practice, based on the need to keep the written record to a minimum." 8 Nathan Gordan testimony, 9/16/75, Hearings, Vol. 1. * 1957 IG Report. 88 - 408 In 1963, the Inspector General noted that the head of the BNDD had been briefed about the project, but the IG's report did not indi- cate the level of detail provided to him. Dr. Gottlieb testified that "I remember meeting Mr. Anslinger and had the general feeling that he was aware." 89 Another CIA officer did not recall any discussion of testing on unwitting subjects when he and Dr. Gottlieb met with Com- missioner Anslinger. In a memorandum for the record in 1967 Dr. Gottlieb stated that Harry Giordano, who replaced Mr. Anslinger, told Dr. Gottlieb that when he became Commissioner he was "only generally briefed on the arrangements, gave it his general blessing, and said he didn't want to know the details." The same memorandum states, however, that there were several comments which indicated to Dr. Gottlieb that Mr. Gior- dano was aware of the substance of the project. It is possible that the Commissioner provided a general authorization for the arrange- ment without understanding what it entailed or considering its pro- priety. A reluctance to seek detailed information from the CIA, and the CIA's hesitancy to volunteer it, has -been found in a number of instances during the Select Committee's investigations. This problem is not confined to the executive branch but has also marked congres- sional relationships with the Agency. c. Internal Review.-The waiver of regulations and the absence of documentation make it difficult to determine now who authorized which activities. More importantly, they made internal Agency review mechanisms much less effective."o Controversial and highly sensitive projects which should have been subject to the most rigorous inspection lacked effective internal review. Given the role of the General Counsel and his reaction to the sur- reptitious administration of LSD to Dr. Olson, it would have seemed likely that he would be asked about the le'ality or propriety of any subsequent projects involving such administration. This was not done. He did not learn about this testing until the 1970's. Nor was the Gen- eral Counsel's opinion sought on other MKULTRA projects, though these had been characterized by the Inspector General in the 1957 Report on TSD as "unethical and illicit."91 There is no mention in the report of the 1957 Inspector General's survey of TSD of the project involving the surreptitious administra- tion of LSD. That project was apparently not brought to the attention of the survey team. The Inspector who discovered it during the IG's 1963 survey of TSD recalls coming upon evidence of it inadvertently, " Gottlieb, 10/18/75, p. 28. 9 The IG's report on MKULTRA In 1963 stated: "The original charter documents specified that TSD maintain exacting con- trol of MKULTRA activities. In so doing, however, TSD has pursued a phi- losophy of minimum documentation in keeping with the high sensitivity of some of the projects. Some files were found to present a reasonably complete record, including most sensitive matters, while others with parallel objectives contained little or no data at all. The lack of consistent records precluded use of routine inspection procedures and raised a variety of questions concerning manage- ment and fiscal controls." " CIA, Inspector General's report on TSD, 1957, p. 217. 409 rather than its having been called to his attention as an especially sensitive project. 92 Thus both the General Counsel and the Inspector General, the prin- cipal internal mechanisms for the control of possibly improper actions, were excluded from regular reviews of the project. When the project was discovered the Executive Director-Comptroller voiced strong op- position to it; it is possible that the project would have been termi- nated in 1957 if it had been called to his attention when he then served as Inspector General. The Audit Staff, which also serves an internal review function through the examination of Agency expenditures, also encountered substantial difficulty with MKULTRA. When MKULTRA was first proposed the Audit Staff was to be excluded from any function. This was soon changed. However, the waiver of normal "contractual pro- cedures" in MIULTRA increased the likelihood of "irregularities" as well as the difficulty in detecting them. The head of the Audit Branch characterized the MKULTRA procedures as "having allowed practices that produced gross administrative failures," including a lack of controls within outside contractors which would "assure proper accountability in use of government funds." It also diminished the CIA's capacity to verify the accountings provided by outside firms. d. Compartmentation and Jurisdictional Conflict Within the Agency.-As has been noted, the testing and use of chemical and biological agents yas treated as a highly sensitive activity within the CIA, This resulted in a high degree of compartmentation. At the same time substantial jurisdictional conflict existed within the Agency be- tween the Technical Services Division, and the Office of Medical Serv- ices and the Office of Security. This compartmentation and jurisdictional conflict may well have led to duplication of effort within the CIA and to Agency policy- makers being deprived of useful information. During the early 1950's first the BLUEBIRD Committee and then the ARTICHOKE Committee were instituted to bring together rep- resentatives of the Agency components which had a legitimate inter- est in the area of the alteration of human behavior. By 1957 both these committees had fallen into disuse. No information went to the Tech- nical Services Division (a component supposedly represented on the ARTICHOKE Committee) about ARTICHOKE operations being conducted by the Office of Security and the Office of Medical Services. The Technical Services Division which was providing support to the Clandestine Services in the use of chemical and biological agents, but provided little or no information to either the Office of Security or the Office of Medical Services. As one TSD officer involved in these pro- grams testified: "Although we were acquainted, we certainly didn't share experiences." 93 " Even after the Inspector came upon it the IG did not perform a complete investigation of it. It was discovered at the end of an extensive survey of TSD and the Inspector was in the process of being transferred to another post within the Agency. "Testimony of CIA officer, 11/21/75, p. 14. 90 410 QKHILLTOP, another group designed to coordinate research in this area also had little success. The group met infrequently-only twice a year-and little specific information was exchanged. 9 Concern over security obviously played some role in the failure to share information,95 but this appears not to be the only reason. A TSD officer stated that the Office of Medical Services simply wasn't "par- ticularly interested in what we were doing" and never sought such information.6 On the other hand, a representative of the Office of Medical Services consistently sought to have medical personnel par- ticipate in the use of chemical and biological agents suggested that TSD did not inform the Office of Medical Services in order to pre- vent their involvement. Jurisdictional conflict was constant in this area. The Office of Security, which had been assigned responsibility for direction of ARTICHOKE, consistently sought to bring TSD operations in- volving psychochemicals under the ARTICHOKE umbrella. The Office of Medical Services sought to have OMS physicians advise and participate in the operational use of drugs. As the Inspector Gen- eral described it in 1957, "the basic issue is concerned with the extent of authority that should be exercised by the Chief, Medical Staff, over the activities of TSD which encroach upon or enter into the medical field," and which are conducted by TSD "without seeking the prior approval of the Chief, Medical Staff, and often without informing him of their nature and extent." 97 As was noted previously, because the projects and programs of TSD stemmed directly from operational needs controlled by the DDP, the IG recommended no further supervision of these activi- ties by the Medical Staff : It is completely unrealistic to consider assigning to the Chief, Medical Staff, what, in effect, would be authority over clandestine operations. Furthermore, some of the activities of Chemical Division are not only unorthodox but unethical and sometimes illegal. The DDP is in a better position to evaluate the justification for such operations than the Chief, Medical Staff .9 [Emphasis added.] Because the advice of the Director of Security was needed for "evaluating the risks involved" in the programs and because the knowledge that the CIA was "engaging in unethical and illicit activi- ties would have serious repercussions in political and diplomatic circles," the IG recommended that the Director of Security be fully advised of TSD's activities in these areas. Even after the Inspector General's Report of 1957, the compartmen- tation and jurisdictional conflict continued. They may have had a sub- The one set of minutes from a QKHILLTOP meeting indicated that individ- uals in the Office of Medical Services stressed the need for more contact. ' When asked why information on the surreptitious administration of LSI) was not presented to the ARTICHOKE committee, Dr. Gottlieb responded: "I imagine the only reason would have been a concern for broadening the aware- ness of its existence." 'IA ifficer. 11/21/75. p. 14. IG Survey of TS), 1957. p. 217. 0a Ibid. 91 411 stantial negative impact on policymaking in the Agency. As the Dep- uty Chief of the Counterintelligence Staff noted in 1958, due to the different positions taken by TSS, the Office of Security, and the Office of Medical Services on the use of chemical or biological agents, it was possible that the individual who authorized the use of a chemical or biological agent could be presented with "incomplete facts upon which to make a decision relevant to its use." Even a committee set up by the DDP in 1958 to attempt to rationalize Agency policy did not have ac- cess to records of testing and use. This was due, in part, to excessive compartmentation, and jurisdictional conflict. C. COVERT TESTING ON HUMAN SUBJECTS BY MILITARY INTELLIGENCE Gnours: MATERIAL TESTING PROGRAM EA 1729, PROJECT THIRD CHANGE, AND PROJECT DERBY HAT EA 1729 is the designator used in the Army drug testing program for Ivsergic acid diethylamide (LSD). Interest in LSD was originally aroused at the Army's Chemical Warfare Laboratories by open litera- ture on the unusual effects of the compound.99 The positive intelli- gence and counterintelligence potential envisioned for compounds like LSD, and suspected Soviet interest in such materials,100 supported the development of an American military capability and resulted in ex- periments conducted jointly by the U.S. Army Intelligence Board and the Chemical Warfare Laboratories. These experiments, designed to evaluate potential intelligence uses of LSD, were known collectively as "Material Testing Program EA 1729." Two projects of particular interest conducted as part of these experiments, "THIRD CHANCE" and "DERBY HAT", involved the administration of LSD to unwitting subjects in Europe and the Far East. In many respects, the Army's testing programs duplicated research which had already been conducted by the CIA. They certainly involved the risks inherent in the early phases of drug testing. In the Army's tests, as with those of the CIA, individual rights were also subordi- nated to national security considerations; informed consent and follow- up examinations of subjects were neglected in efforts to maintain the secrecy of the tests. Finally, the command and control problems which were apparent in the CIA's programs are paralleled by a lack of clear authorization and supervision in the Army's programs. " USAINTC staff study, "Material Testing Program, EA 1729," 10/15/59, p. 4. 'This same USAINTC study cited "A 1952 (several years prior to initial U.S. interest in LSD-25) report that the Soviets purchased a large quantity of LSD-25 from the Sandoz Company in 1951, reputed to be sufficient for 50 million doses." (Ibid., p. 16.) Generally accepted Soviet methods and counterintelligence concerns were also strong motivating factors in the initiation of this research: "A primary justification for field experimentation in intelligence with EA 1729 is the counter-intelligence or defense implication. We know that the enemy phi- losophy condones any kind of coercion or violence for intelligence purposes. There is proof that his intelligence service has used drugs in the past. There is strong evidence of keen interest in EA 1729 by him. If for no other purpose than to know what to expect from enemy intelligence use of the material and to, thus, he pre- pared to counter it, field experimentation is justified." (Ibid, p. 34) 412 1. Scope of Testing Between 1955 and 1958 research was initiated by the Army Chemical Corps to evaluate the potential for LSD as a chemical warfare inca- pacitating agent.. In the course of this research, LSD was administered to more than 1,000 American volunteers who then participated in a series of tests designed to ascertain the effects of the drug on their ability to function as soldiers. With the exception of one set of tests at Fort Bragg, these and subsequent laboratory experiments to evalu- ate chemical warfare potential were conducted at the Army Chemical Warfare Laboratories, Edgewood, Maryland. In 1958 a new series of laboratory tests were initiated at Edgewood. These experiments were conducted as the initial phase of Material Testing Program EA 1729 to evaluate the intelligence potential of LSD, and included LSD tests on 95 volunteers.o' As part of these tests, three structured experiments were conducted: 1. LSD was administered surreptitiously at a simulated social reception to volunteer subjects who were unaware of the purpose or nature of the tests in which they were participating; 2. LSD was administered to volunteers who were subse- quently polygraphed; and 3. LSD was administered to volunteers who were then confined to "isolation chambers". These structured experiments were designed to evaluate the validity of the traditional security training all subjects had undergone in the face of unconventional, drug enhanced, interrogations. At the conclusion of the laboratory test phase of Material Testing Program EA 1729 in 1960, the Army Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence (ACSI) authorized operational field testing of LSD. The first field tests were conducted in Europe by an Army Special Pur- pose Team (SPT) during the period from May to August of 1961. These tests were known as Project THIRD CHANCE and involved eleven separate interrogations of ten subjects, None of the subjects were volunteers and none were aware that they were to receive LSD. All but one subject, a U.S. soldier implicated in the theft of classified documents, were alleged to be foreign intelligence sources or agents. While interrogations of these individuals were only moder- ately successful, at least one subject (the U.S. soldier) exhibited symptoms of severe paranoia while under the influence of the drug. The second series of field tests, Project DERBY HAT, were con- ducted by an Army SPT in the Far East during the period from August to November of 1962. Seven subjects were interrogated under DERBY HAT, all of whom were foreign nationals either sus- pected of dealing in narcotics or implicated in foreign intelligence operations. The purpose of this second set of experiments was to col- lect additional data on the utility of LSD in field interrogations, and to evaluate any different effects the drug might have on "Orientals."

Inadequate Coordination Among Intelligence Agencies On October 15, 1959, the U.S. Army Intelligence Center prepared lengthy staff study on Material Testing Program EA 1729. The stated purpose of the staff study was: "to determine the desirability of EA 1729 on non-US subjects in selected actual operations under controlled conditions. 1 0 2 It was on the basis of this study that operational field tests were later conducted. After noting that the Chemical Warfare Laboratories began experi- ments with LSD on humans in 1955 and had administered the drug to over 1,000 volunteers, the "background" section of the study concluded: There has not been a single case of residual ill effect. Study of the prolific scientific literature on LSD-25 and personal communication between US Army Chemical Corps person- nel and other researchers in this field have failed to disclose an authenticated instance of irreversible change being pro- duced in normal humans by the drug.0 3 This conclusion was reached despite an awareness that there were inherent medical dangers in such experimentation. In the body of this same study it is noted that: The view has been expressed that EA 1729 is a potentially dangerous drug, whose pharmaceutical actions are not fully understood and there has been cited the possibility of the continuance of a chemically induced psychosis in chronic: form, particularly if a latent schizophrenic were a subject, with consequent claim or representation against the U.S. Government.'0 An attempt was made to minimize potential medical hazards by care- ful selection of subjects prior to field tests. Rejecting evidence that the drug might be hazardous, the study continued: The claim of possible permanent damage caused by EA 1729 is an unproven hypothesis based on the characteristic effect of the material. While the added stress of a real situation may increase the probability of permanent adverse effect, the resulting risk is deemed to be slight by the medical re- search personnel of the Chemical Warfare Laboratories. To prevent even such a slight risk, the proposed plan for field experimentation calls for overt, if possible, or contrived- through-ruse, if necessary, physical and mental examination of any real situation subject prior to employment of the subject.10 5 This conclusion was drawn six years after one deaith had occurred which could be attributed, at least in part., to the effects of the very drug the Army was proposing to field test.. The USAINTC staff, however, was apparently unaware of the circumstances surround- ing Dr. Olson's death. This lack of knowledge is indicative of the " TISAINTC staff study. "Material TEsting Program EA 1729." 10/15/.9, p. 4. "03 Ibid., p. 4. 'Ibid.. p. 25. 10 Ibid. 96-408 0 - 77 - 7 414 general lack of interagency communication on drug related research. As the October 1959 study noted, "there has been no coordination with other intelligence agencies up to the present." 10G On December 7, 1959, the Army Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelli- gence (ACSI, apparently a General Willems) was briefed on the proposed operational use of LSD by VUSAINTC Project Officer Jacob- son, in preparation for Project. THIRD CHANCE. General Willems expressed concern that the project had not been coordinated with the FBI and the CIA. He is quoted as saying "that if this project is going to be worth anything it [LSD] should be used on higher types of non-U.S. subjects" in other words "staffers." He indicated this could be accomplished if the CIA were brought in. The summary of the briefing prepared by a MajorMIehorskY continues: "Of particular note is that ACSI did not. direct coordination with CIA and the FBI but only mentioned it for consideration by the planners." 107 After the briefing, four colonels, two lieutenant colonels and Major Mehovsky iet to discuss interagency cooperation with CIA and FBI. The group consensus was to postplone efforts toward coordination: Lt. Col. Jacobson commented that before we coordinate with CIA we should have more factual findings from field experi- mentation with counterintelligence cases that will strengthen our position and proposal for cooperation. This approach was agreed to by the conferees. 08 Had such coordination been achieved, the safety of these experiments might have been viewed differently and the tests themselves might have been seen as unnecessary. 3. Subordination of Individual Rights to National Security Consid- erations Just as many of these experiments may have been unnecessary, the nature of the operational tests (polygraph-assisted interrogations of drugged suspects) reflects a basic disregard for the fundamental human rights of the subjects. The interrogation of an American soldier as part of the THIRD CHANCE 1961 tests is an example of this disregard. The "trip report" for Project THIRD CHANCE, dated Septem- ber 6, 1961, recounts the circumstances surrounding and the results of the tests as follows: [The subject] was a U.S. soldier who had confessed to theft of classified documents. Conventional methods had failed to ascertain whether espionage intent was involved. A significant new admission by subject that lie told a fellow soldier of the theft while lie still had the documents in his possession was obtained during the EA 1729 interrogation along with other variations of Subject's previous account. The interrogation results were deemed by the local operational authority satis- factory evidence of Subject's claim of innocence in regard to espionage intent.o 9 'Ibid., p. 6. 0 Mehovsky Fact Sheet, 12/9/60, p. 1. 1' Ibid., p. 2. 10 SPT Trip Report, Operation THIRD CHANCE, 9/6/61, p. 5. 415 The subject apparently reacted very strongly to the drug, and the interrogation, while productive, was difficult. The trip report concluded: (1) This case demonstrated the ability to interrogate a subject profitably throughout a highly sustained and almost incapacitating reaction to EA 1729. (2) The apparent value of bringing a subject into the EA 1729 situation in a highly stressed state was indicated. (3) The usefulness of employing as a duress factor the de- vice of inviting the subject's attention to his EA 1729- influenced state and threatening to extend this state in- definitely even to a permanent condition of insanity, or to bring it to an end at the discretion of the interrogators was shown to be effective. (4) The need for preplanned precautions against extreme paranoiac reaction to EA 1729 was indicated. (5) It was brought to attention by this case that where sub- ject has undergone extended intensive interrogation prior to the EA 1729 episode and has persisted in a version repeatedly during conventional interrogation, adherence to the same ver- sion while under EA 1729 influence, however extreme the reac- tion, may not necessarily be evidence of truth but merely the ability to adhere to a well rehearsed story."x0 This strong reaction to the drug and the accompanying discomfort this individual suffered were exploited by the use of traditional inter- rogation techniques. While there is no evidence that physical violence or torture were employed in connection with this interrogation, physi- cal and psychological techniques were used in the THIRD CHANCE experiments to exploit the subjects' altered mental state, and to maxi- inize the stress situation. Jacobson described these methods in his trip report: Stressing techniques employed included silent treatment be- fore or after EA 1729 administration, sustained conventional interrogation prior to EA 1729 interrogation, deprivation of food, drink, sleep or bodily evacuation, sustained isolation prior to EA 1729 administration, hot-cold switches in ap- proach, duress "pitches", verbal degradation and bodily dis- comfort, or dramatized threats to subject's life or mental health."' Another gross violation of an individual's fundamental rights oc- curred in September 1962 as part of the Army's DERBY HAT tests in the Far East. A suspected Asian espionage agent was given 6 micrograms of LSD per kilogram of bodyweight. The administration of the drug was completed at 1035 that morning: At 1120, sweating became evident, his pulse became thready. He was placed in a supine position. He began groaning with expiration and became semicomatose.112 .o Ibid., pp. 17-18. "' Ibid., p. 13. ""DERBY HAT" Medical and Pharmacological Report: Case #1, 9/20/62, p. D10-2. 416 For the next 28 minutes, the subject remained semicomatose. At 1148, responses to painful stimuli were slightly improved. At 1155, he was helped to a sitting position. At 1200, he became shocky again and was returned to supine position. At 1212, he was more alert and able to sit up with help. At 1220, Subject was assisted to the interrogation table. At 1230, he began moaning he wanted to die and usually ignored questions. Rarely he stated "he didn't know." At 1250, his phasic alertness persisted. He frequently re- focused his eyes with eyelid assistance. He frequently threw his head back with eyes closed. At 1330, he was slightly more alert. He was forced-walked for 5 minutes. He physically would cooperate until he became shocky again (sweating, thready pulse, pale). For the next three hours the subject remained in about the same con- dition. Continued attempts at interrogation yielded no relevant answers. Six hours after receiving the drug, the subject began giving relevant answers to questions. Eight and one-half hours after the initial dosage, the subject was polygraphed. The interrogation con- tinued for seventeen and one-half hours after the drug was ad- ministered. There was some psychological and medical screening of the in- dividuals tested within the United States, in Europe, and in Asia. The proposal for the field experimentation in fact called for such examinations. The fact of prescreening did not eliminate the risk of injury; .the availability of medical staff did, however, limit injury and may well have prevented the death of one or more of the subjects. As the medical corps member of the team which surrepti- tiously administered the LSD noted, "one subject. . .did collapse after the interrogation and the presence of the medical officer was not only of value to the subject but to the interrogation team who were thus assured that an unnecessary untoward result would not occur." "1 In the October 15, 1959, USAINTC staff study, moral and legal ramifications of covert administration of LSD in field conditions were considered. It was always a tenet of Army Intelligence that the basic American principle of the dignity and welfare of the in- dividual will not be violated. . . . A more meticulous regard for the prohibition against violence or duress is taken in practice when the suspect is a US citizen or ally as against an actual or potential enemy, in peace as against war, and in respect to the nature of the crime. . . . In intelligence, the stakes involved and the interests of national security may permit a more tolerant interpretation of moral-ethical values, but not. legal limits, through necessity. . . . Any claim "n Ibid., p. D10-3. ' SPT Trip Report, Operation THIRD CHANCE, 7/25/61, p. 1. 417 against the US Government for alleged injury due to EA 1729 must be legally shown to have been due to the material. Proper security and appropriate operational techniques can protect the fact of employment of EA 1729.116 On the basis of this evaluation, the stiidy concluded that in view of "the stakes involved and the interests of national security," the pro- posed phtn for field testing should be approved. The surreptitious administration of drugs to unwitting subjects by the Army raises serious constitutional and legal issues. The considera- tion given these issues by the Army was wholly insufficient. The char- acter of the Army's volunteer testing program and the possibility that drugs were simply substituted for other forms of violence or duress in field interrogations raises serious doubts as to whether national se- curity imperatives were properly interpreted. The "consent" forms which each American volunteer signed prior to the administration of LSD are a case in point. These forms contained no mention of the medical and psychological risks inherent in such testing, nor do they mention the nature of the psychotrophic drug to be administered: The general nature of the experiments in which I have voluteered. have been explained to me from the standpoint of jossible hazards to my health. It is my understanding that the experime:dz are so designed, based on the results of aniibals and previous human experimentation, that the antic- ipated results will justify the performance of the experi- ment. I understand further that experiments will be so con- ducted as to avoid all unnecessary physical and medical suffering and injury, and that I ,uill be at liberty to request that the experiments be terminated at any time if in my opin- ion I have reached the physical or mental state where con- tinuation of the experiments becomes undesirable. I recognize that in the pursuit of certain experiments transitory discomfort may occur. I recognize, also, that under these circumstances, I must rely upon the skill and wisdom of the physician supervising the experiment to institute what- ever medical or surgical measures are indicated. [Emphasis added.] i1s The exclusion of any specific discussion of the nature of LSD in these forms raises serious doubts as to their validity. An "understand- ing . . . that the anticipated results will justify the performance of the experiment" without full knowledge of the nature of the experi- ment is an incomplete "understanding." Similarly, the nature of the experiment limited the ability of both the subject to request its re- quest its termination and the experimenter to implement such a request. Finally, the euphemistic characterization of "transitory discomfort" and the agreement to "rely on the skill and wisdom of the physician" combine to conceal inherent risks in the experimentation and may be viewed as disolving the experimenter of personal responsibility for damaging aftereffects. In summary, a "volunteer" program in which subjects are not fully informed of potential hazards to their persons is ''voluinteer" in name only. u9USAINTC staff study, "Material Testing Program EA 1729," 10/15/59, p. 26. " Sample volunteer consent form. 418 This problem was compounded by the security statements signed by each volunteer before he participated in the testing. As part of this statement, potential subjects agreed that they would: . not divulge or make available any information related to U.S. Army Intelligence Center interest or participation in the Department of the Army Medical Research Volunteer Program to any individual, nation, organization, business, association, or other group or entity, not officially authorized to receive such information. I understand that any action contrary to the provisions of this statement will render me liable to punishment under the provisions of the Uniform Code of Military Justice.119 Under these provisions, a volunteer experiencing aftereffects of the test might have been unable to seek immediate medical assistance. This disregard for the well-being of subjects drug testing is in- excusable. Further, the absence of any comprehensive long-term medical assistance for the subjects of these experiments is not only unscientific; it is also unprofessional. 4. Lack of Normal Authorization and Supervision It is apparent from documents supplied to the Committee that the Army's testing programs often operated under informal and nonrou- tine authorization. Potentially dangerous operations such as these testing programs are the very projects which ought to be subject to the closest internal scrutiny at the highest levels of the military com- mand structure. There are numerous examples of inadequate review, partial consideration, and incomplete approval in the administration of these programs. When the first Army program to use LSD on American soldiers in "field stations" -was authorized in May 1955, the Army violated its own procedures in obtaining approval. Under Army Chief of Staff Memorandum 385, such proposals were to be personally approved by the Secretary of the Army. Although the plan was submitted to him on April 26, 1956, the Secretary issued no written authorization for the project, and there is no evidence that he either reviewed or ap- proved the plan. Less than a month later, the Army Chief of Staff issued a memorandum authorizing the tests.120 Subsequent testing of LSD under Material Testing Program EA 1729 operated generally under this authorization. When the plans for this testing were originally discussed in early 1958 by officials of the Army Intelligence Center at Fort Holabird and representatives of the Chemical Warfare Center at Edgewood Arsenal, aivinformal pro- posal was formulated. This proposal was submitted to the Medical Research Directorate at Edgewood by the President of the Army In- telligence Board on June 3, 1958. There is no evidence that the plan was approved at any level higher than the President of the Intelli- gence Board or the Commanding General of Edgewood. The approval at Edgewood appears to have been issued by the Commander's Adju- tant. The Medical Research Laboratories did not submit the plan to the Surgeon General for approval (a standard procedure) because Sample Volunteer Security Statement. Inspector General of the Army Report, "Use of Volunteers in Chemical Agent Research," 3/10/76, p. 109. 99 419 the new program was ostensibly covered by the authorizations granted in May 1956.121 The two projects involving the operational use of LSD (THIRD CHANCE and DERBY HAT) were apparently approved by the Army Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence (General Willems) on December 7, 1960.'22 This verbal approval came in the course of a briefing on previous drug programs and on the planned field experi- mentation. There is no record of written approval being issued by the ACSI to authorize these specific projects until January 1961, and there is no record of any specific knowledge or approval by the Secre- tary of the Army. On February 4, 1963, Major General C. F. Leonard, Army ACSI, forwarded a copy of the THIRD CHANCE Trip Report to Army Chief of Staff, General Earl Wheeler. 123 Wheeler had apparently requested a copy on February 2. The report was routed through a Gen- eral Hamlett. While this report included background on the origins of the LSD tests, it appears that General Wheeler may only have read the conclusion and recommendations. 24 The office memorandum accompanying the Trip Report bears Wheeler's initials.125 5. Termination of Te8ting On April 10, 1963, a briefing was held in the ACSI's office on the results of Projects THIRD CHANCE and DERBY HAT. Both SPT's concluded that more field testing was required before LSD could be utilized as an integral aid to counterintelligence interroga- tions. During the presentation of the DERBY HAT results, General Leonard (Deputy ACSI) directed that no further field testing be undertaken. 126 After this meeting the ACSI sent a letter to the Com- manding General of the Army Combat Developments Command (CDC) requesting that he review THIRD CHANCE and DERBY HAT and "make a net evaluation concerning the adoption of EA 1729 for future use as an effective and profitable aid in counterintelligence interrogations." 127 On the same day the ACSI requested that the CDC Commander revise regulation FM 30-17 to read in part: ... in no instance will drugs be used as an aid to interro- gations in counterintelligence or security operations without prior permission of the Department of the Army. Requests to use drugs as an investigative aid will be forwarded through intelligence channels to the OACSI, DA, for approval.... Medical research has established that information obtained through the use of these drugs is unreliable and invalid.... It is considered that DA [Army] approval must be a pre- requisite for use of such drugs because of the moral, legal, medical and political problems inherent in their use for intel- ligence purposes.2 8 "' Ibid., pp. 135, 137, 138. 1"2 Mehovsky Fact Sheet, 12/9/60.

The official termination date of these testing programs is rather unclear, but a later ACSI memo indicates that it may have occurred in September of 1963. On the 19th of that month a meeting was held between Dr. Van Sims (Edgewood Arsenal), Major Clovis (Chemi- cal Research Laboratory), and ACSI representatives (General Deholm and Colonel Schmidt). "As a result of this conference a deter- mination was made to suspend the program and any further activity pending a more profitable and suitable use." 129 D. COOPERATION AND COMPETITION AMONG THE INTELLIGENCE COM- MUNITY AGENCIES AND BETWEEN THESE AGENCIES AND OTHER INDIVIDUALS AND INSTITUTIONS 1. Relationships Among Ageicies Within the Intelligence Community Relationships among intelligence community agencies in this area varied considerably over time, ranging from full cooperation to intense and wasteful competition. The early period was- marked by a high degree of cooperation among the agencies of the intelligence commu- nity. Although the military dominated research involving chemical and biological agents, the information developed was shared with the FBI and the CIA. But the spirit of cooperation did not continue. The failure by the military to share information apparently breached the spirit, if not the letter, of commands from above. As noted above, the Army Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence was briefed on the proposed operational testing of LSD under Project THIRD CHANCE, and expressed concern that the project had not been coordinated with FBI and CIA. Despite this request, no coordi- nation was achieved between the Army and either of these agencies. Had such cooperation been forthcoming, this project may have been evaluated in a different light. The competition between the agencies in this area reached bizarre levels. A military officer told a CIA representative in confidence about the military's field testing of LSD in Europe under Project THIRD CHANCE, and the CIA promptly attempted to learn surreptitiously the nature and extent of the program. At roughly the same time Mr. Helms argued to the DDCI that the unwitting testing program should be continued, as it contributed to the CIA's capability in the area and thus allowed the CIA "to restrain others in the intelligence community (such as the Department of Defense) from pursuing operations.' 130 The MKNAOMI prdgram was also marked by a failure to share information. The Army Special Forces (the principal customer of the Special Operations Division at Fort Dietrick) and the CIA rather than attempting to coordinate their efforts promulgated different re- quirements which varied only slightly. This apparently resulted in some duplication of effort. In order to insure the security of CIA operations, the Agency would request materials from SO) for opera- tional use without fully or accurately describing the operational requirements. This resulted in limitations on SOD's ability to assist the CIA. Undated ASCI memoifandui, p. 2. 2 Memorandum from the DDP to the DCI, 11/9/64, p. 2. 101 421 0. Relationships Between the Intelligence Community Agencies and Foreign Liaison Services The subjects of the CIA's operational testing of chemical and bio- logical agents abroad were generally being held for interrogation by foreign intelligence or security organizations. Although information about the use of drugs was generally withheld from these organiza- tions, cooperation with them necessarily jeopardized the security of CIA interest in these materials. Cooperation also placed the American Government in a position of complicity in actions which violated the rights of the subjects, and which may have violated the laws of the country in which the experiments took place. Cooperation between the intelligence agencies and organizations in foreign countries was not limited to relationships with the intelligence or internal security organizations. Some MKULTRA research was conducted abroad. While this is, in itself, not a questionable practice, it is important that such research abroad not be undertaken to evade American laws. That this was a possibility is suggested by an ARTI- CHOKE memorandum in which it is noted that working with the scientists of a foreign country "might be very advantageous" since that government "permitted certain activities which were not per- mitted by the United States government (i.e., experimeits on anthrax, etc.). "131 3. The Relationships Between the Intelligence Community Agencies and Other Agencies of the U.S. Government Certain U.S. government agencies actively assisted the efforts of intelligence agencies in this area. One form of assistance was to pro- vide "cover" for research contracts let by intelligence agencies, in order to disguise intelligence community interest in chemical and biological agents. Other forms of assistance raise more serious questions. Although the CIA's project involving the surreptitious administration of LSD was conducted by Bureau of Narcotics personnel, there was no open connection between the Bureau personnel and the Agency. The Bureau was serving as a "cut-out" in order to make it difficult to trace Agency participation. The cut-out arrangement, however, reduced the CIA's ability to control the program. The Agency could not control the process by which subjects were selected and cultivated, and could not regulate follow-up after the testing. Moreover, as the CIA's Inspector General noted: "the handling of test subjects in the last analysis rests with the [Bureau of Narcotics] agent working alone. Suppression of knowledge of critical results from the top CIA management is an inherent risk in these operations." 132 The arrangement also made it impossible for the Agency to be certain that the decision to end the surreptitious administration of LSD would be honored by the Bureau personnel. The arrangement with the Bureau of Narcotics was described as "informal." 113 The informality of the arrangement compounded the problem is aggravated by the fact that the 40 Committee has had vir- 13 ARTICHOKE Memorandum, 6/13/52. IG Report on M1KULTRA. 1963, p. 14. 'xIbid.. This was taken by one Agency official to mean that there would be no written contract and no formal mechanism for payment. (Elder, 12/18/75, p. 31.) 422 apparent unwillingness on the part of the Bureau's leadership to ask for details, and the CIA's hesitation in volunteering information. These problems raise serious questions of command and control within the Bureau. 4. Relationships Between the Intelligence Community Agencies and Other Institutions and Individuals, Public and Private The Inspector General's 1963- Survey of MKULTRA noted that "the research and development" phase was conducted through standing arrangements with "specialists in universities, pharmaceu- tical houses, hospitals, state and federal institutions, and private re- search organizations" in a manner which concealed "from the institu- tion the interests of the CIA." Only a few "key individuals" in each institution were "made witting of Agency sponsorship." The research and development phase was succeeded by a phase involving "phy- sicians, toxicologists, and other specialists in mental, narcotics, and general hospitals and prisons, who are provided the products and findings of the basic research projects and proceed with intensive test- ing on human subjects." 1 According to the Inspector General, the MKULTRA testing pro- grams were "conducted under accepted scientific procedures . . . where health permits, test subjects are voluntary participants in the programs." 135 This was clearly not true in the project involving the surreptitious administration of LSD, which was marked by a com- plete lack of screening, medical supervision, opportunity to observe, or medical or psychological follow-up. The intelligence agencies allowed individual researchers to design their project. Experiments sponsored by these researchers (wiich in- chided one where narcotics addicts were sent to Lexington, Kentucky, who were rewarded with the drug of their addiction in return for participation in experiments with LSD) call into question the deci- sion by the agencies not to fix guidelines for the experiments. The MKUTLTRA research and development program raises other questions, as well. It is not clear whether individuals in prisons, mental, narcotics and general hospitals can provide "informed consent" to participation in experiments such as these. There is doubt as to whether institutions should be unwitting of the ultimate sponsor of research being done in their facilities. The nature of the arrangements also made it impossible for the individuals who were not aware of the sponsor of the research to exercise any choice about their participa- tion based on the sponsoring organization. Although greater precautions are now being taken in research con- ducted on behalf of the intelligence community agencies, the dilemma of classification remains. These agencies obviously wished to conceal their interest in certain forms of research in order to avoid stimulating interest in the same areas by hostile governments. In some cases today contractors or researchers wish to conceal their, connection with these agencies. Yet the fact of classification prevents open discussion and debate upon which scholarly work depends. "m Ibid. p. 9.

(U/AIUO) This memorandum is to advise you that additional MKULTRA documents have been discovered and to obtain your approval for follow-on actions required. Paragraph 7 contains a recommended course of action. 2. (U/AIUO) As a result of John Harks FOXA re- quest (F-76-374), all of the MIKULTRA material in OTS possession was reviewed for possible release to him. Following that review, the OTS material in the Retired Records Center was searched. It was during that latter search that the subproject files were located among the. retired records of the OTS Budget and Fiscal Section. These files were not discovered earlier as the earlier searches were limited to the examination of the-active and retired records of those branches considered mo!t likely to have generated or have had access tp NKULTRA documents. Those branches included: Chmistry, Biological, Behavioral Activities, and Contracts Manage- ment. Because Dr. Gottlieb retrieved and destroyed all the MKULTRA documents he was able to locate, it is not surprising that the earlier search for MIKULTRA documents, directed at areas where they were most likely to be found, was unsuccessful. The purpose of establishing the MKULTRA mechanism was to limit knowledge of the sensitive work being performed to those with an absolute nO'd to know. If those precepts had been followed, the recently found - B&F files should have contained only financial and administrative documents.

Office of Technical Service The Didctor of Central Intelligence The Honorable Daniel K. Inouye, Chairman Select Committee on Intelligence United States Senate Washington, D.C. 20510 Dear Mr. Chairman: During the course of 1975 when the Senate Committee, chaired by Senator Church, was investigating intelligence activities, the CIA was asked to produce documentation on a program of experimentation with the effect of drugs. Under this project conducted from 1953 to 1964 and known as "MK-ULTRA," tests were conducted on American citizens in some.cates without their knowledge. The CIA, after searching for such documentation, reported that most of the documents on this matter have been destroyed. I find it my duty to report to you now that our continuing search for drug related, as well as other documents, has uncovered certain papers which bear on this matter. Let me hasten to add that I am persuaded that there was no previous attempt to conceal this material in the original 1975 exploration-r The material recently discovered was in the retired archives filed under financial accounts and only uncovered by using extraordinary and extensive search efforts. In this connection, incidentally, I have personally commended the employee whose diligence produced this find. Because the new material now on hand is primarily of a financial nature, it does not present a complete picture of the field of drug experimentation activity but it does provide more detail than was previously available to us. For example, the following types of activities were undertaken: a. Possible additional cases of drugs being tested on American citizens, without their knowledge. b. Research was undertaken on surreptitious methods of administering drugs. c. Some of. the persons chosen for experimentation were drug addicts or alcoholics. d. Research into the development of a knockout or "K" drug was performed in conjunction with being done to develop pain killers for advanced cancer patients, and tests on such patients were carried out. 2 e. There is a possibility of an improper payment to a private institution. The drug related activities described in this newly located material began almost 25 years ago. I assure you they were discontinued over 10 years ago and do not take place today. In keeping with the President's commitment to disclose any errors of the Intelligence Community which are uncovered, I-would like to volunteer to testify before your Committee on the full details of this unfortunate series of events. I-am in the process of reading the fairly voluminous material involved and do want to be certain that I have a complete picture when I talk with the Committee. I will be in touch with you next week to discuss when hearings might be scheduled at the earliest opportunity. I regret having to bring this issue to your attention, but I know that it is essential to your oversight procedures that you be kept fully informed in a timely manner.

It is requested that the Chief, TSS indicate his knowledge and approval of this particular expenditure for audit purposes.

While the Director's statutory authority to expend funds for confidential purposes is not limited by law, we believe that a gift of Government funds as such would exceed the intent of the Congress in granting that power. Hoever, where a gift is made for the express purpose of producing something of value to this Agency which cannot ctherwise be obtained and there is a reason- able expectation that the value may be received, the gift may in effect be an expenditure for proper official purposes. 2. In Subproject 35, it is stated that.the donation in question would achieve certain ends desired by TSS. There seems to be no question that those ends would be advantageous, so the main questions appear to be whether they could not be attained by more direct, normal methods, and, if not, whether the return is necessary and reasonable in relation to the donation. 3. We are in no position to review the requirements of TSS or to appraise the advantages that would result from this project. We do not comment, therefore, on the value received if'the project results in the benefits foreseen. We feel we should corment on factors affecting the probability of achieving those ends. In a legal sense, there is little or no control. Once the funds are donated, the individual, his foundation, or the hospital could conceivably refuse to work for us or allow us the use of the facilities. 4. Practically, the control seems to be established as well as circumstances permit. Certainly, as long as the individual is alive and in his present position, we have every reason to expect his complete cooperation in the future as in the past, unless through scoe act or fault of our own he is alienated. Even in the event of his death or incapacity, there appears to be a reasonable DCopy#d1d to:of1cop by authority If: !87475 A *~ao:.~ns1977 - .a 7; La134 Copy #1 ofil copy 121 cherce c ontir.. the ro,:ect. if these probabilities appear zurficient to chtain an adequate return for the expenditure, there can be no legal objection to this aspect of the project. 5. It should be noted that there are two Circumstances which require consideration in a final determination. As stated in Section V, our contribution, by appearing to be from a private source, would increase the matching Government contribution by a similar amount which would not be the case if it were known that this was in fact a Government contributicn also. Secondly, it is the stated policy of the hospital tb charge the Government end commercial organizations 80 per cent overhead on research contracts, whereas nonprofit foxundations pay only direct costs but no overhead. Because of the ostensible source, our projects will not be charged overhead. This could be construed -as mbrally wrongful to the hospital,- .as normally we would pay the 80 Per cent overhead charge for projects performed directly for us, but I believe this can be offset, at least to the amount of our donation, and perhaps by the further a:ount by which the other Government contri- butions are increased by our dcnation. In any case, if the project is a proper one and must be performed in this manner, security dictates these circu'stances and they, therefore, do not present a legal obstacle as such. 6. We raised the question whether funds for the hospital construction could not be obtained from other normal charitable sources. It appeared that there was a sting possibtility that the individual concerned could raise adequate funds from private resources, but it was the position of TSS that if this were the case we would not obtain the-commitment from the individual and the degree of control which this project is desiGned to achieve.

Subproject 35 as approved by the DGI on 15 January 1955 contemplated a financial contribution of $125, 000 to the : to - participate in the construction of a new.repearch wing to cost $3, 0 000 exclusive of furnishings and equipment. Agency funds will be transmitted through the acut-out which - - B will result in oe-sixth oc e s~p=ace inthe new researca wing being made available for Agency-sponsored research involving covert biological and chemical techniques of warfare. 2. At that time (15 January 1955) am with CIA - 1 encouragement indicated a willingness to contribute $500, 000 to the construc- tion fund. The building fund was to have been raised as follows: $1,000,000 - Contributed by - 1 250, 000 - Donation from of which - $125, 000 to be supplied by CIA 1,250,000 - Matching funds under Public Law 2Z1 equal to the amount of the two above contributions 500,000- :-B $3, 000, 000 - TOTAL 3. Since it now appears that the expected contribution by will not be forthcoming, permission is requested to increase the Agency's contribution by $250, 000 which will result in a financial situation as follows: $1, 000, 000 - Contributed by - 1 500,000 - Donation from including . $375,000 supplied by CIA 1,500,000 - Matching funds under Public Law 221 equal to the amount of the two above contributions $3, 000, 000 - TOTAL - 4. The Agency's contribution would thus total $375,000. This investment, together with the equal sum resulting from matched funds, is fully justified in the opinion of TSS for reasons which will be explained by - C. Chief, TSS, and Dr. Sidney Gottlieb, Chief, TSS/Chemical Division. The scope of subproject 35 has not changed since the Director originally approved a request by TSS for permission to spend $125, 000 of available rads for tihs purpose through the controls and rocedures established f- %!.':LTRA. At the time subproject 35 was set up within the scope of tC- :.,S M, D pro:;ram, security considerations and cover arrangements werc c.ircesily.reviewed, and the Office of General Counsel assisted in legal steteri:mations. With the exception of funding arrangements, no changes in :irogram have since been made. .Funds to cover previously approved sum o $125, 000 are available wt -in the TSS budget for FY 55 and have b en set aside. The TSS ,ud ct, however, lacks funds with which to co r the supplemental sum of $250, 000, and it is requested that the TSS udget be increased by this amount. Supplementary funds available for subproject 35 can definitely be obligated by the end of FY 55. L :Llhouty of: 167-175 i. .: !:o 1977 12 .. I:-: CL By 1874175 -2- 128 AMENDMENT TO SUBPROJECT 35, PROJECT MKULTRA For the Purpose of Establishing a Cover Organization for Highly Sensitive Projects in the Field of Biological, Chemical and Radiological Warfare I. Background of Subproject 35. In January 1955 approval was given by the DCI to Subproject 35 of Project MAKULTRA. The documents which lead to this approval (including comments of the OGC) are attached herewith as Tabs 2, A and 3. Project MKULTRA is the framework of procedures and controls under which research projects in certain highly sensitive fields are carried out by TSS. A description of the background of Project MKULTRA may be found on page 1 of Tab A. Subproject 35 establishes cover 'under which the Chemical Division of DD/P/TSS would conduct certain sensitive projects in the fields of biological and chemical warfare and consists of a proposed arrangement whereby the Agency covertly contributes funds to assist th in the construction of a new research wing. Contribution of these funds is to be made through the - B 4 s cut-out so that the would remain - unwitting of Agency participation in the building program. Projects would later be carried out by the Chemical Division using the facilities of the new research wing, and Agency employees would be able to participate in the work without the University or the Hospital authorities being aware of Agency interest. Subproject 35 contemplated the contribution of Agency funds to assist in the construction of facilities. Future research work would be carried out through the. as cut-out and would be - separately funded under existing procedures and controls. and the background of - B h are described on page 2 of Tab A. On the same page there will be found a further description of the - 1 II. Building Fund. The University will require $3, 000, 000 for the six-story addition to the hospital exclusive of the cost of land, heating and power supply which are being provided by the University. Under Public Law 221, Subappropriation 01.'riys: 177 663, dated 26 August 1954, funds are available to match funds raised for this purpose by the University. When Subproject 35 was first prepared, it was hoped and expected that the funds required would be provided as follows: The University has allocated $1, 000, 000 to this project and will assume upkeep and staffing obligations. agreed that if the Agency would provide S - B with a grant of $125, 000, the Fund would match this amount and make a total donation of $250, 000 to the University Building Fund. At that time, discussions with Ago 0- indicated that would contribute $500, 000 to the building project on the basis that radi ogical research would be conducted in the new wing and that the constr ion of the new facilities was of interest to that Agency. In summary, th financial situation was to have been as follows: $1, 000, 000 - 250, 000 - Donation from (of which - 3 $125, 000 was supplied by CIA) 1, 250, 000 - Matched Funds under Public Law 221 500,000 - - Q $3, 000, 000 - TOTAL It was recogpized that the Federal contribution 1,250, 000 under Public Law 221 would be seemingly inflated by reas of the inclusion of the CIA contribution in that of It was felt that the value to the Agency was such that this inflation of the Federal contribution was more than justified by the importance of the over-all project and that furthermore, the inclusion of the CIA contribution in that of _____ was the best means of maintaining security. III /3 The original informal commitment ont pa f w was first obtained through verbal discussions with wl'ch were fcllowed up by an exchange of corresponden e between the DCI and 40 1 - C. Unfortunately at that time was fully occupied with the contro- versy concerning the and continued contact with - C subordinates resulted in a ecision that could not or wvould not contribute to the Building und, but would be w. ing to support an annual research program amount to $50, 000 to $75, 0 It is not Copy # I of I copy 130 known whether this change in policy was suggested tp o or - C_ whether it originated with him. Be that as it may, when the change in policy became apparent, it was evident that additional funds would be re- quired to complete the hospital construction. IV. Suggcsted Funding. It is now suggested that the $3, 000, 000 required for the hospital wing be provided as follows: $1,000,000 - 500, 000 -Dnonfro l'including - $375, 000 supplied by CIA) 1,500,000 - Matched Funds from Public Law 221 $3, 000, 000 - TOTAL The donation from ould thus consist of the original $125, 000 to be. supplied by CIA plus the sum of $125, 000 to be provided by the Fund and a supplemental CIA contribution of $250, 000. Originally Subproject 35 requested permission to make a contribution of $125, 000 to the building fund and approval was given. This approval is enclosed herewith as Tab 2. The purpose of this amendment to Subproject 35 is to request permission to contribute an additional $250, 000 to the building construction fund through it should be noted that - 3 the total Government contribution to the hospital fund still remains unchanged at $1, 875, 000. The increase in the size of the contribution by the Fund is not out of keeping with other operations of 6 and will - 13 not arouse undue comment because of its magnitude. The originally approved contribution has not as yet been transmitted to and neither the -4 original contribution nor the supplement would be paid to 'd until -- funds adequate to complete the project are made available. This condition was specified by the DCI in approving the original contribution. V. Source of CIA Funds. Funds to cover the initially approved sum of $125, 000 are available and have been segregated for this purpose within the TSS FY 1955 Budget for Research and Development. Insufficient funds remain in the TSS budget to cover the supplementary sum of $230, 000, and it is therefore requested that the TSS . budget be increased by this amount and that the increase be made available to Subproject 35 of Project MKULTRA. Copy # 1 of 1 copy -3- 131. VI. Comments by the Office of General Counsel. Tab 3 is a memorandum from the General Counsel to the DCI dated 21 December 1954, commenting on Subproject 35, and stating in part that there are no fundamental legal objections if the probable benefits are con- sidered a fair return for this expenditure. The amendment to the Subproject contemplates only an increase in funds and in no way changes any other aspect of the project. The project has been referred back to the OGC even though no change in its structure is contemplated, and Tab 4 contains his comments. VII. Justification. The advantages and benefits accruing to the Agency outlined in Tab A are felt by TSS to provide adequata and complete justification for the expenditure of the additional sum herein requested which brings the total CIA contribu- tion to $375, 000. The most important of these advantages and benefits may be summarized as follows: (Fuller explanations may be found in Tab A). a. One-sixth of the total space in the new hospital wing will be available to the Chemical Division of TSS, thereby providing labora- tory and office space, technical assistants; equipment and experi- mental animals. b. Agency sponsorship of sensitive research projects will be completely deniable. c. Full professional cover will be.provided for up to three bio- chemical employees of the Chemical Division. d. Human patients and volunteers for experimental use will be available under controlled clinical conditions within the full supervision of - . Subproject 35.was originally conceived in October and November of 1954, and the dnsuing six months have indicated that inc reasing emphasis and importance are being placed on the Chemical Division's work in this field. The facilities of the hospital and the ability to conduct controlled experi- ments under safe clinical conditions using materials with which any Agency connection must be completely deniable will augment and complement other programs recently taken over by TSS, such as - 4 rc,.- 18747115 I'll of'7 1775copy 4 1 of I COPY 7 77 132 It was originally thought that at least 18 months wouLd elapse after the building funds had been raised before the facilities would be finished and could be occupied by TSS, This lengthy delay has now been overcome. IMVJWhas raised the $500, 000 which his Fund will ostensibly contribute, he will then be allowed to use existing space in the present hospital in order that he may build up the organization which will later occupy the new wing. This means that TSS will be able to begin to take advantage of this cover situation within a matter of months instead of waiting for a year and a half. VIII. Security. Security matters. and details are being co-ordinated with the TSS Liaison and Security Officer. Security of transmittal of the funds and cover arrange- ments are described in Tab A and remain unchanged. IX. Agreement with 4 E The agreement with as is described in Tab A, and the extent of his co-operation and the control over his actions remain unchanged. X. Resultant Financial Saving. The total contribution of $375, 000 by CIA will, result in an additional $375, 000 in matching funds provided under Public Law 221. It is felt that the expenditure of these total funds is justified by the importance of the programs which will be pursued at the new facility. Even though the CIA contribution is increased under this amended project, the total of Federal funds remains unchanged. The use of this facility will allow work to proceed under conditions of cover and security which would be impossible to obtain elsewhere without an expenditure of equivalent or greater funds. In addition, by funding individual projects for this facility through the 13- .no charge will be incurred for overhead expense. If research projects 1'ml'111 I iare openly sponsored by the - U1. S. Government, it is customary to pay an overhead rate equivalent to 80% of salaries. However; if a non-profit fund, such as - 5 sponsors research, the funds granted for the work are customarily used only to pay for salaries, equipment and supplies, but not overhead. The Agency thus buys considerably more research.through - 9 40 han would be the case if no cut-out were used.

Background of Project MKULTRA. In 1953 the DCI approved Project MKULTRA which established procedures and controls under which research projects in certain highly sensitive fields could be carried out by TSS without the necessity of signing the usual contracts. The approved procedures apply over-all Research and Development budget, and no additional funds are required. Controls established in the Project Review Committee approval of the Research and Development program (other than the signing of a contract) remain unchanged, and special provisions for audit are included. All files are retained by TSS. Thesd procedures and cbntrols were approved since it is highly un- desirable from a policy and security point of view that contracts be signed indicating Agency or Government interest in this field of en- deavor. In a great many instances the work must be conducted by in- dividuals who are not and should not be aware of Agency interest. In other cases the individuals involved are unwilling to have their names on a contract which remains out of their control in our files. Experience has shown that qualified, competent individuals in the field of physio- logical, psychiatric and other biological sciences are very reluctant to enter into.signed agreements of any sort which would connect them .with this activity since such connection might seriously jeopardize their professional reputations. When Project:MKULTRA was approved, it was not contemplated that it would be used for the establishment of cover. Over forty individual research and development projects have been established under this framework and have been carried out extremely successfully, both from technical and administrative points of view. The experience gained in handling these projects has emphasized that establishment of better cover both for the projects and for associated Agency scientists is of utmost importance. Subproject 35 would establish such cover. Dornareded to: Aba - b z-. 1: ty- or C?75 * 10-77 x.t~ortty Of: 107475 jv~ 1 977 !i2'T; ME BY 18S7475 135 II.

It has been generally recognized for some time that the external re- search activities of the Chemical Division of TSS in the field of covert biological, chemical and radiological warfare are sorely in need of proper cover. Although Project MKULTRA provides excellent admini- strative and financial cover for projects, it does not afford cover for scientific or technical personnel. MKULTRA has been used for dealing through as a cut-out and for working directly with individuals or-private companies. The use of in the future will be increasingly limited-due to (a)' The increasing number of people who, albeit properly cleared, are aware of the Agency connection with - 8 (b) The feeling by M that the Agency - C employees contacting him (Drs. Gottlieb, etc.) have no cover of any sort and - C consequently expose him to unnecessary and highly undesirable personal risk; and (c) The widespread intra-Agency awareness of the nature of the relationship between the Fund and the Agency. Another serious problem faced by TSS/CD as a result of lack of suit- able cover is the difficulty in planning careers for technical and scientific personnel in the biological field. A long-range career concept of activities in this field inevitably includes proper cover for the individual concerned. The availability of research facilities at OI ill offer an excellent opportunity - to solve many of the above problems, and is willing - C and able to make any reasonable arrangements to suit our needs. Up to three Chemical Division employees can be integrated into . - C program for work in the new hospital wing on the Agency's research projects. Although career planning was not a consideration when planning the procedures and controls established by Project MKULTRA, nevertheless this particular subproject, in addition to its primary objective, will be of very great secondary help 7 n uthority of: 187475 -.

'Advantages and Benefits Accruing to TSS. The contemplated arrangements will.jesult in many advantages and benefits, including the following: (a) One-sixth of the total space in the new research .wing is to be available to and - C in turn, will be available to the Chemical Division of TSS. This will provide laboratory and office space, technical assistants, equip- ment and experimental animals for use of Chemical Division personnel in connection with specific future projects. (b) The cost of Chemical Division projects which are to be carried out under this cover will be covered by funds made available through Project MKULTRA, and projects will be subject to the procedures and, controls established for.MKULTRA. The funds will be passed through s has been done in the past. %iIll in turn will either pay expenses directly or transfer the money to the University for this purpose. Each project will be individually funded based on its particular budget, and there will be no other continuing or recurring charges for items such as space, facilities, etc. (c) The Agency's sponsorship of sensitive research projects would be completely deniable since no connection would exist between the University and the Agency. (d) Excellent professional cover would be provided for up to three bio-chemical employees of the Chemical Division of TSS. This would allow open attendance at scientific meetings.. the advancement of personal. standing in the scientific world, and as such, would constitute a major efficiency and L* c Dr rdod to t- :rthrity cf: 137175 C :: Je 1977 Copy #_/ of 2 copies C-5 139 morale booster. (e) Human patients and volunteers for experimental use will be available under excellent clinical conditions with the full supervision of - (f) There would be available the equivalent of a hospital safehouse. (g) It is expected that the output of useful results of the Chemical Division in the bio-chemical field will be greatly improved through the more efficient use of technical personnel who would be able to spend more of their time on actual laboratory work. (h) (i) Excellent facilities would be provided for recruiting new scientific personnel since members of the Chemical Division working under this cover will be in daily contact with members of the Graduate School of the University. (J) The regular University library and reprint seryice will be available as a source of. technical information. VIII. Funding. It is proposed that $125, 000 be granted to if approval is granted, TSS will arrange for payment to be made under the procedures and controls of MKULTRA.

The funds would be transferred as a grant to uIn In turn will match these funds with an equal amount and donate a total -- of $250, 000 to the University as outlined in paragraph V.

Resultant Financial Saving. The $125, 000 to be contributed by CIA plus the $125, 000 in matching funds provided under P. L. 221 to the Building Fund will be more than offset in a few years by the savings which will result from use of this non-profit fund. If a research project at or other educa- tional non-profit institution is sponsored by the 1J. S. Government, it is customary for the Government to pay for salaries, equipment, supplies, .etc. and for overhead as well. In the case of . . the overhead amossnts to 80% of salaries. However, if a non- profit foundation such as sponsors research at a non-profit institution, the funds granted for the work are customarily used to pay for salaries, equipment and supplies but not for overhead. The Government dollar thus buys considerably more research through than would be the case if no cut-out were used. XII. Legal Matters.

The purpose of this triP was to make arrangements for closing out the pro jec. iad been given ample previous notice that such was likely to be the iaent of the visit. anI he pro- pared himself accordingly. Z. It was explained to inp that it would not be possible to carry over funds beyond the end of the current fiscal year. Therefore all work would have to be completed and all pay- ments made prior to 30 June. This deadline appeared acceptable to him, and it was agreed that I would make my final visit there to receive reports and attend to final details on 16 Juno. Q did not have a current financial report, but he estimated that funds currently on hand would be about sufficient for remaining expenditures. Be agreed to send the Society within the next 10 days a more exact state- ment of current balance and estimated remaining expenditures. I tried to impress on him strongly that transfer of additional funds and/ or return of unexpeaded funds must be completed well bfore the end of the fiscal year. 3. Of the 30 cases called for in the original doeign 13 have been completed (but only 4 have been transcribed from the tapes). In addition there are 8 cases in proLreos (of which two are already in interview and 6 are worked up to the point of having the lists of questions prepared). It was agreed that to meet the deadline we would have to limit the design to these 26 cases. 4. It is apparent that' is so Involved in the administrative problems of the project that he is not paying any attention to the results. Since to date only 4 cases have been transcribed there is no way of telling what is coming out of it. I assume there were no dramatic reactions, be- cause the interviewers would have let him know about them had they emerzed. It is possiblo, however, that our own analysis cf the data may dredge up something of value, although I am dubious on this point. 5. gave me his usual long involved talk on the difficulties he had encountered which account for the delays. He also talked at some 143 length about his -- "pcrimear.* -th bypnoul.. gos_ aspecta of wactb are mildly h.aur-raiamng.

FOR THE RECORD SUBJECT: Project MKULTRA, Subproject 2 1. Subproject 42 is to be continued for the same purposes as when originallyestablished: to support covert and realistic field trials of certain research and development items of interest to TSD, and to maintain the physical facilities required for these trials. 2. In the past year a number of covert and realistic field ,trials have been successfully carried out. The seults of these experiments have provided factual data essential to establishing protocols for a number of contemplated operations. A continuation of covert and realistic field trials are necessitated by the production of new materials in TSD programs, particularly in areas requiring detailed knowledge of the effectiveness pnd efficiency of deliverjI systems. Additional trials are also necessitated by the need for better controlled "field-type" experiments. 3. The estimated cost of the ,project is $5,000.00 for a period of six months.

This subproject is being established for the purpose of supporting realistic tests of certain development items and delivery systems of interest. to TSD/BB. 2. During the course of development it is sometimes found that certain very necessary experiments or tests are not suited to ordinary laboratory facilities. At the same time, it would be difficult if not imp&ssible to conduct such tests as operatiqnal field tests. This project is designed .to pro- vide a capability and facilities to fill this intermediate requirement. 3.

TSD/Biological Branch Distribution: Original only 165 SUBJECT: Request for Support of Research on the Mechanism of Brain Concussion 1. This is a request for financial support for research on the mechanism of brain concussion for the period 1 Feb 1956 to 1 Feb 1957. 2. The resonance-cavitation theory upon which this research is to be based, has been presented in the proposal, submitted to th dated 27 March 1954. 3. The program as originally submAtted estimated the duration of the program to be from three to five years requesting a total of $72,109 for the initial year. 4. At the request of the a reduced budget was submitted. , 5. .amounting to $24,925, was then awarded to the to support this program from 1 Feb 1955 t Feb 1950. 6. The progress made to date under the above contract can be summarized as follows: A. RESEARCH FACILITIES The following research facilities have been established for the investigation of the very diverse aspects of the problems being studied: Atotal of 250 square feet of laboratory and office space equipped with much of the diversified machinery and apparatus necessary for research in this field. b. Blast Range A blast range has been established at located approximately f the malaors ry. This area is owned rby theMand is closed to the public. Three blast test-series have been run to date. Arrangments have been made with the for use of their hmncadavers. A test area has been assigned for this WARNING ELLIGENt CE ;ES' AND METHODS IN1VOLVED 166 B. PERSONNEL - - Both full-time technical personnel and part-time professional research personnel have been acquired and indoctrinated relative to their specific function. C. TECHNICAL PROGRESS Following is the technical progress made uxder the current contract: a. Specialized instrumentation and numerous testing techniques have been developed to obtain-the desired dynamic data. b. Considerable data has now been obtained supporting the resonance-cavitation theory of brain concussion. c. Preliminary acceleration threshold data has been obtained for a fluid-filled glass simulated skull. d. Data kas been obtained on the nature and the magnitude of pressure fluctuations within a glass simulated skull subject to either impact or sound waves propagated in air. e. Initial studies have been made on the simulated glass skull attempting to establish the cavitation patterns for various types of impact. 7. The proposed method and program plan remain the same as stated in the original proposal, except for the temporary- deletion of the immersion blast study. 8. The current level of activity on this ptoject can be indicated by the most recent billing to the for the month of November, which amounted to $4,034.61. 9. In the interest of efficiency and economy it is requested that at least this level of activity be maintained for the coming year. WARNING Nfl SELLIGENCE AND METHODS INVOLVED 167 1.1 Trotter. W. defies brain concussion as, 'an essentially transient state due to head injury which is of instantanious onset, manifests widespread symptoms of purely paralytic kind, does not as such comprise any evidence of structural cerebral injury, and is always followed by amnesia for the actual moment of the accident." 10.2 The implication of the underlined portion of the above statement is that if a technique were devised to induce brain concussion without giving either advance warning or causing external physical trauma, the person upon recovery would be unable to recall what had happened to him. Under these conditions the same technique of producing the concussion could be re-used many times without disclosure of its nature. 10.3 First, considering the possibilities of direct impact to the head or body, it should be..possible-from the findings of this research program to determine the following: a. Optimum design of impacting devices. b. Optimum points of impact on skull or body for the specific effects desired.. c. Intensity of the blow for the effect desired. 10.4 In regard to the potential impacting devices, there are certain design requsitesothat are apparent at this time: a. The impact should be delivered without advance warning. b.. The area of impact and force distribution should be such that surface trauma does not occur. c. The intensity of the impacting force and its duration should be such as to obtain the desired effect. d. The device should be as small and as silent as possible. 10.5 The specific impacting devices might take the form of any of the following: a. A pancake type black-jack giving a high peak impact force with a low unit surface pressure. b. Concealed or camouflaged spring-loaded impacting devices that trigger upon contact with the head. (Original and sole copy :agg) 168 - .*. - .- a. A prcjecttle type mpeter oan as an, ear asr. u sing a sall shot fllb eack fo a proJectle. d. An explosive pad detonated in contact with the head or the body. 10.6 Let us now consider the possibilities of exciting the resonance cavitation directly without impact. There is coaisiderable evidence that resonance cavitation can be induced directljr in the following ways: a. A blast wave propagated in air. (Blast Concussion) b. Physical excitation with a mechanical driver or horn, tuned to the resonant frequency of the head. 10.7 A single blast pressure wave propagated in air must have considerable intensity in order to produce brain concussion, however, there is considerable evidence (Carver & Dinsley) that modification of the pressure wave can produce profound effects. 10.8 Excitation of the resonance cavitation by using a tuned driver at this time appears to be well within the relm of possibility. The neurotic-like manifestations normally associated with blast concussion could possibly be induced by this method. Use of this methodtiowever, would require actual physical contact with the drivers. 10.9 Excitation of the resonance cavitation by tuned sound waves also appears to be a reasonable possibility.

The ability of this bubble to expand under dynamic loading would be most effective in preventing resonance cavitation from occuring.

Funding commenced in FY 1966, and ended in FY 1972. Its purpose was to develop, test, and evaluate capabilities in the covert use of biological, chemical, and radioactive material systems and techniques for producing predictable human behavioral and/or physiological changes in support of highly sensitive operational requirements. OFTEN/CHICKWIT In 1967 the Office of Research and Development (ORD) and the Edgewood Arsenal Research Laboratories undertook a program for doing research on the identification and characterization of drugs that could influence human behavior. Edgewood had the facilities for the full range of laboratory and clinical testing. A phased program was envisioned that would consist of acquisition of drugs and chemical compounds believed to have effects on the behavior of humans, and testing and evaluating these materials through laboratory procedures and toxi- cological studies. Compounds believed promising as a result of tests on animals were then to be evaluated clinically with human subjects at Edgewood. Substances of potential use would then be analyzed structurally as a basis for identifying and synthesizing possible new derivatives of greater utility. The program was divided into two projects. Project OFTEN was to deal with testing the toxicological, transmisivity and behavioral effects of drugs in animals and, ultimately, humans. Project CHICKWIT was concerned-with acquiring infor- mation on new drug developments in Europe and the Orient, and with acquiring samples. There is a discrepancy between the testimony of DOD and CIA regarding the testing at Edgewood Arsenal in June 1973. While there is agreement that human testing occurred at that place and time, there is disagreement as to who was responsible for financing and sponsorship.

It highlights how the book broke the silence in the American media on CIA covert operations. It documents the CIA’s attempts to censor the book upon its publication. It will also show how the book was reinterpreted by conspiracy theorists, Soviet propagandists, and leading figures within the decolonization movement. Finally, it argues that the book’s ultimate legacy, although a misreading of their original argument, can be found in the ‘deep state’ narrative so prevalent among conspiracy theorists today. ARTICLE HISTORY Received 28 September 2023 Accepted 30 November 2023 Introduction ‘There are two governments in the United States today. One is visible. The other is invisible’. With this stark declaration, journalists David Wise and Thomas Ross opened their bestselling history of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), titled pointedly: The Invisible Government.1 It was a landmark book. Published in 1964, it was the first bestselling history of CIA, and one of the first detailed accounts of US covert operations abroad. It was also remarkably influential, inspiring a generation of journalists and activists who would soon come of age amidst the turmoil of US intervention in Vietnam, and the disenchantment with US foreign policy back home that this would inspire. Published in 1964, it marked something of a turning point in the public discussion of both the CIA specifically, and US foreign policy more generally. It was also a foundational text in the evolution of a narrative about US government secrecy that would eventually metastasize into the ‘deep state’ narrative of unaccountable federal bureaucracies run amok. In recent times this narrative has become a key rhetorical instrument utilized by, among others, President Donald Trump to galvanize his base. Indeed, this idea of a ‘deep state’, or an Invisible Government to use Wise and Ross’ term, has become one of the central pillars in the chaotic narrative universe of the QAnon movement that inspired the attempted insurrection at the United States Capitol on the 6 January 2021. Perhaps more than any other story about the United States intelligence community, it has also sig­ nificantly tarnished the reputation of the CIA and other US intelligence services. When, for example, CIA reporting became uncomfortable for Trump (CIA whistleblowers on Hunter Biden in Ukraine, or reports about Russian influence in the 2016 election), Trump repeatedly used the term ‘deep state’, and the narrative it invokes, to dismiss his own intelligence community.2 It would be unfair, however, to condemn The Invisible Government as a paranoid conspiracy theory. Whilst Wise and Ross certainly did argue that the CIA had at times exceeded their authority, and even acted without Presidential approval, their argument was more nuanced than the coarse polemics of many contemporary purveyors of ‘deep state’ paranoia.

Part of the reason its impact was so significant was that it provided a narrative framework for understanding activities that were hitherto largely undiscussed, namely, CIA covert action. Up until the CIA’s very public failure at the Bay of Pigs in 1961, CIA covert operations were almost entirely absent from the American media. The Invisible Government was part of a wave of journalism that sought to come to terms with the meaning of CIA covert operations for our understanding of US foreign policy. As the first bestselling history of the CIA which focused upon covert action, it was perhaps the most significant work to emerge from this effort, helping to shape the interpretation of CIA covert operations for decades to come. Utilizing archival research this article examines the history of The Invisible Government. First it contextualizes its impact by exploring what came before it: the absence of widespread public discussion of CIA covert operations followed by a growing interest in the topic in the wake of the Bay of Pigs. It then documents the book’s production history, in particular the attempts by the CIA to prevent its publication. This was a major precursor for the later efforts by the CIA to censor critical histories of its own organization, for example its later lawsuits against CIA insiders Victor Marchetti, Philip Agee and Frank Snepp. In this much earlier example, we find evidence of the CIA attempting to go beyond the maintenance of official secrecy for the preservation of national security, veering instead into a conscious effort to censor a book that by the CIA’s own admission, included no content that would constitute a security breach. The strongest argument that they could find against the book’s publication was that its critical narrative would provide ample propaganda opportunities for the Soviet Union. They were right. The USSR did utilize The Invisible Government in its anti-CIA propaganda. But if providing the enemy with a critical narrative were reason enough to block a book’s publication, then almost any critique of the CIA, or U.S. foreign policy, might qualify it for censorship. The final section of this article explores the influence of The Invisible Government. It was not only conspiracy theorists and Soviet propagandists who read the book. Leading activists, student protestors, policymakers, revolutionary leaders, prime ministers, and leading advocates of decoloni­ zation, were also inspired by Wise and Ross’s framing of US covert operations. By examining the history of The Invisible Government, from pre-publication through to its lasting influence, this article argues that, for better or worse, it is one of the most significant books that has ever been published about the CIA. A conspiracy of silence?: The absence of covert action in the American media before the Bay of Pigs One of the remarkable features of the early Cold War obsession with espionage in the United States was that spies were invariably portrayed as foreign agents. The notion that the United States conducted espionage and covert operations abroad was almost entirely absent from American popular culture in this period. ‘For fifteen years or more’, wrote the former spy turned novelist John Le Carré, both the West and the Soviet Union ‘believed that in the public mind only Counter- Intelligence was respectable. Each side spoke with horror of the treachery of the other, each spoke proudly of its own vigilance in frustrating the efforts of hostile spies and saboteurs, but maintained the fiction that it abstained from aggressive espionage’.3 Although David Hadley has convincingly documented a ‘rising clamour’ of press criticism of the CIA from the 1950s onwards, almost none of that criticism concerned CIA covert operations until the disastrous attempt to invade Cuba at the Bay of Pigs made the topic almost unavoidable.4 Journalists were critical of perceived CIA intelligence failures, such as their apparent failure to predict the outbreak of war in Korea, and the riots that broke out in Bogota in 1948 during Secretary of State George Marshall’s visit to the Pan-American Conference.5 They also covered Senator Joseph McCarthy’s attacks against the CIA for apparently harboring communist spies.6 From time to time they also questioned whether a more robust system of accountability was necessary to oversee the fledgling intelligence service.7 What they didn’t cover was the CIA’s involvement in coups in Iran, Guatemala and Indonesia, or the myriad other CIA covert 282 S. WILLMETTS operations of this period that is sometimes referred to as the ‘golden age’ of covert action. Indeed, it is not a coincidence that one of the CIA’s most active periods of engaging in covert action was simultaneously an era in which the American press routinely avoided covering those operations. In later decades, with the presence of a more recalcitrant press that were perfectly prepared to report on covert CIA operations, it became far more difficult for the Agency to engage in such risky operations. Many journalists were not ignorant of CIA covert action. Kennett Love, a New York Times foreign correspondent and one of only two American journalists in Tehran during the 1953 coup, was introduced to the leader of the coup, General Fazlollah Zahedi, through his CIA contacts. He even helped distribute propaganda leaflets that were printed by the CIA and was well aware, even involved with, CIA operatives on the ground during the coup.8 Yet, not a single article that he published during those tumultuous days mentioned the CIA’s involvement. James Reston, the Times’ Washington bureau chief, acknowledged that ‘we left out a great deal of what we knew about U.S. intervention in Guatemala and in a variety of other cases’ because ‘we are clearly in a form of warfare with the Communist world’ and therefore ‘it has not been difficult to ignore information which, if published, would have been valuable to the enemy’.9 Journalists were not the only representatives of the American media to ignore US covert opera­ tions abroad. Hollywood also deliberately avoided the subject. Joseph Mankiewicz’s 1958 big screen adaptation of Graham Greene’s novel The Quiet American completely inverted the original story from a cautionary tale about the dire consequences of US covert intervention in Vietnam into a film starring an American war hero successfully foiling a communist plot. Indeed, Greene’s novel was one of the few popular texts of this era to condemn CIA covert action: Alden Pyle, the eponymous Quiet American, is a young and idealistic CIA officer who supplies plastic explosives to Caodaist rebels who then detonate them in a crowded central Saigon square, killing many innocents. When the novel was published in the United States Greene was attacked for being ‘anti-American’, and accused of depicting Americans as mass murderers.10 The notion that the United States covertly funded violent insurgencies abroad was still a taboo subject, inspiring consternation among a significant section of Greene’s American readership. Helped and encouraged by real CIA officer Edward Lansdale, often assumed to be Greene’s inspiration for Alden Pyle, Mankiewicz bowdlerized Greene’s plot.11 Pyle, in the movie, was played by American war hero Audie Murphy, and is a much more sympathetic character. Crucially, Mankiewicz pins the blame for the Saigon Square bombings firmly on the communists. Once again, a story of American covert intervention abroad is ignored, replaced instead with a story of communist subversion. Popular spy radio and television shows of this era further reinforced this idea that Americans did not involve themselves in aggressive covert operations abroad. In the popular radio and later television series The Man Called X, central protagonist Agent X does indeed fly to exoticized foreign locales. But the show’s writers were careful to make sure that Agent X is always invited as a guest to the country. As the show’s producer, Maurice Unger, instructed one of the show’s Directors, Eddie Davis, ‘Officially our government has no foreign espionage system in peacetime . . . therefore, it is important in our stories that when X goes to a foreign country, it must not be for the purpose of official or unofficial espionage’.12 Another television show of the era, Diplomatic Courier, likewise featured an American government official invited by friendly foreign nations to help foil communist or criminal plots. Remarkably, in a funhouse mirror inversion of the real history of covert action in the 1950s, episodes were often set in countries like Iran or Guatemala. Except, rather than instigating coups in these places like their real-life counterparts, this show’s American officer abroad helps foil the attempted overthrow of a number of governments, including Iran’s. Once again, American spies (although never directly identified as such in the movies) were there to defend democracy against foreign subversion, and were never themselves engaged in acts of covert aggression abroad.13 One noteworthy exception to this widespread taboo on discussing American covert operations proves the rule. In 1954 a series of three high profile articles were published in the Saturday Evening Post by husband-and-wife team Richard and Gladys Harkness, which for the first time revealed the INTELLIGENCE AND NATIONAL SECURITY 283 CIA’s involvement in the Iranian and Guatemalan coups.14 The CIA had assisted the Harkness’ with their research and Director of Central Intelligence Allen Dulles sat with them for an extended interview. The articles appeared in the aftermath of Senator McCarthy’s attacks on the Agency, who claimed, characteristically, that the CIA had been infiltrated by communist agents. The Agency needed publicity that, contra McCarthy’s allegations, portrayed them as a vital lynchpin in the struggle against communism. With impeccable timing, the Harkness articles appeared, celebrating the CIA’s role in helping to topple governments in Iran and Guatemala that the Harknesses portrayed as indisputably wedded to the Soviet Union. Indeed, even though these articles broke with conven­ tion by acknowledging US covert operations abroad, they did so within a broader narrative frame­ work that nevertheless portrayed the United States acting defensively in reaction to Soviet provocation. In Guatemala, according to the Harknesses’ account, the CIA’s hand was forced by the Soviet Union after they discovered that they had been supplying weapons to what the Harknesses describe as ‘Red-dominated Guatemala’.15 Likewise, the ‘strategic little nation of Iran was rescued from the clutching claw of Moscow’ by the CIA’s intervention.16 Even this first acknowl­ edgment of CIA covert operations in a major American news outlet could not rationalize America’s covert interventions abroad without framing it as a form of defensive reaction to Soviet provoca­ tions. Even more telling, is that although these well-publicized articles blew the lid on the CIA’s involvement in Guatemala and Iran, among other places, the American media continued to ignore covert action. As the Times journalist who had been in close contact with CIA officers in Tehran during the Iran coup later remarked, the Harkness articles were ‘an exception’ in that they acknowl­ edged the CIA’s role in the events that led to Mossadegh’s downfall. Despite this, Love noted, ‘it appears not to have influenced subsequent accounts [of the Iran coup] and if later writers have quoted the Harknesses, I am unaware of it’.17 Despite their awareness of CIA covert action, including detailed knowledge of specific operations, American journalists, filmmakers and radio and television producers consistently refused to write stories that featured aggressive US covert action. Coupled with the ‘spy-mania’ that gripped the nation in the 1950s amidst the hysteria of red politics that imagined a contagion of Soviet sub­ terfuge, the popular image of espionage and covert operations in American culture during this period fixated almost exclusively upon Soviet plots, and the counter-espionage efforts of the United States to unearth and foil them. When texts like Graham Greene’s The Quiet American did try to puncture the myth that American espionage was purely defensive, they were met with consternation from the American press and public, and in the case of The Quiet American, adapted into a screenplay that safely returned the subject of covert operations to an exclusively communist/Soviet activity, bowdlerizing the original point of Greene’s novel in the process. It was not until the debacle at the Bay of Pigs, a disastrous CIA covert operation too big to ignore, that the American media began to take on American covert action in earnest. Controlling the past: The Bay of Pigs and the first wave of critical histories of the CIA The Bay of Pigs marked an important turning point in CIA-press relations. For the first time a major CIA covert action appeared across the front pages of the American newspapers, and the CIA’s role in it was openly discussed. The planned invasion of Cuba was simply too big of an operation to keep secret. Indeed, details of the planned attack appeared on the front page of the New York Times 10 days before the invasion!18 Although Kennedy later blamed the Times for blowing the operation, they were actually late to the game. News of Cuban exiles training at a CIA camp in Guatemala made the headlines of Guatemela’s leading national newspaper, La Hora, on the 30 October 1960, almost six months prior to the invasion.19 Whilst attempts were made to keep this reporting out of the American newspapers, stories still trickled out, and among the Cuban exile population in Miami it was an open secret.20 In the aftermath of the invasion the floodgates opened. It was such a public failure that Kennedy had little choice but to openly acknowledge U.S. involvement and accept responsibility for the debacle. A week later Kennedy chastised the press in a speech at the 284 S. WILLMETTS American Newspaper Publishers Association, warning them that the publication of classified material might aid the Soviet Union.21 The genie, however, was out of the bottle. A wave of reportage and opinion pieces weighed in on whether Kennedy or the CIA were to blame for the disaster. Kennedy helped to fan the flames of this speculation by famously declaring that ‘victory has a hundred fathers and defeat is an orphan’.22 In the months and years that followed a public relations war was waged between the CIA and President Kennedy’s defenders, with each side seeking to blame the other for the disaster.23 For the first time, a CIA covert action was subjected to widespread public scrutiny, and for the first time far-reaching questions began to be asked about whether the CIA should engage in such activities. The Invisible Government was part of this wave of critical press scrutiny of CIA covert operations in the aftermath of the Bay of Pigs. Although it was not published until 1964, Wise and Ross were journalists for the New York Herald Tribune and Chicago Sun-Times respectively, and penned numer­ ous articles on the CIA in the wake of the Bay of Pigs, some rehearsing the thesis that they would later develop in The Invisible Government.24 The pair had also worked on the Gary Powers U-2 Spy Affair story, and co-wrote a book about the incident.25 Their reporting on the CIA and their collaboration on the U-2 book was the basis for The Invisible Government. Despite their experience covering other CIA activities, the Bay of Pigs became a dominant focus of the book. The opening four chapters were about the invasion and its aftermath. Covert operations, Wise and Ross argued, ‘cannot become so unwieldy that they are irreconcilable with the kind of society that has launched them. When that happens, the result is disaster. This was nowhere better illustrated than on the beaches of Cuba’.26 The Invisible Government, however, was not the first book to re-examine the history of the CIA and covert action in the wake of the Bay of Pigs. A number of books appeared in the aftermath of the invasion that offered the first wave of critical histories of the CIA and covert action. Andrew Tully’s CIA: The Inside Story (1962) was the first. By the standards of the books about the CIA that would soon follow, Tully’s criticisms of the Agency were relatively mild, and they were accompanied by tales of derring-do and spy ingenuity that were drawn from the CIA’s own public relations department. Although peppered with anecdotes that reflected favourably on the CIA, Tully’s book did contain a few arguments that troubled the Agency. The first was the already-established thesis that the Agency was heavily comprised of Ivy Leaguers. The second was that the CIA had too-often supported right-wing regimes on the basis of their anti-communist credentials, whilst turning a blind eye to their corrupt practices which failed to improve the lot of local populations. The third critical argument, floated gently by Tully but later rammed home by David Wise and Thomas Ross in their book, was that the CIA had occasionally overstepped the boundaries of policy by taking decisions on the ground in operations that might otherwise not have been authorized by elected officials. In one telling example, Tully argued that the CIA had managed, against Eisenhower’s wishes, to persuade the Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi, to cancel Ike’s visit due to communist agitation in the country. According to Tully, Eisenhower was left furious with the CIA’s decision to go behind his back.27 One of the ironies of The Inside Story was that it was, to an extent, a product of CIA public relations. Tully had interviewed Allen Dulles whilst researching the book, and many of the newspaper clippings that his account relied upon were handed to him by Stanley Grogan, the CIA’s publicity chief.28 Dulles and Grogan were merely extending the same courtesy to Tully that they had to so many other American journalists, and it is doubtful that they told him any more or less than they told others previously. But Tully, realizing the publicity value of touting the idea that the CIA had assisted him in writing the book, included a foreword in which he thanked numerous senior officials for their assistance with the book, including Allen Dulles and Stanley Grogan ‘of CIA’. Dulles, now retired, and Grogan, still working as the CIA’s head of public affairs, were furious. Not only had Tully written what they regarded as a deeply damaging book for the CIA’s public reputation, but he had also advertised the cursory assistance they gave him to lend authority to his narrative. Enraged, Dulles wrote to the publisher demanding that they remove the offending foreword, which they did in subsequent print runs, and condemned the book as a ‘compilation of rumor, hearsay and INTELLIGENCE AND NATIONAL SECURITY 285 republication of previous published speculation about the C.I.A. by Moscow and other Communist centers’.29 Dulles also took to the airwaves. Ten days before the book was published he appeared in a pre-taped interview on NBC’s Meet the Press in which he quipped that The Inside Story would better be described as the ‘upside-down story of the CIA’.30 Not content with condemning the book himself, he also sought to shape the critical reaction to it in the press. He invited the New York Times correspondent Jack Raymond for one of his customary off-the-record discussions, in which he repeated his condemnations of The Inside Story and furnished Raymond with the letter he had written to the publisher denouncing the book.31 Raymond promptly wrote a review of the book for the Times in which he quoted liberally from the former Director’s letter of protest to the publisher, stressed that Tully had exaggerated his claims of insider access, and repeated Dulles’ accusations that it was riddled with factual errors and repetitions of Soviet propaganda. In response, Tully penned a letter to the Times noting that he had been careful to relay this story from one step removed, as an account cited in Edwards and Dunne, and in no way accepted the version as true. Pointedly, he also rebuked Raymond for depending so heavily in his review upon his interview with Dulles, who had already condemned the book as the product of Soviet propaganda: ‘Surely we are past the time’, Tully wondered out loud, ‘when all that is necessary to discredit a work is to say that it says what communists say. The question is not who says what, but whether what is said is so’.32 Despite Tully’s furious rebuttal, there was some truth to Dulles’ claim that Tully had reproduced Soviet propaganda. In particular, Tully had quoted from a biography of Allen Dulles ostensibly written by the British Member of Parliament Bob Edwards and his co-author Kenneth Dunne. But in reality, this damning portrayal of Dulles was penned in Moscow by a senior KGB officer named Vassily Sitnikov.33 Whilst Dulles, now a private citizen, went on the offensive to defend his former agency, and his reputation, the CIA itself wavered. Within the Agency several senior officers urged Dulles’ replace­ ment as Director of CIA, John McCone, to publicly condemn the book, and take action to limit its impact. Lyman Kirkpatrick, the CIA’s Executive Director was particularly vocal, insisting that some­ thing should be done about this ‘terribly damaging book from the viewpoint of the CIA’. But McCone and his Deputy Director Marshall S. Carter disagreed: ‘there is simply no point in getting into you know what kind of a match with a skunk’, they told him. Kirkpatrick’s initial plan to counter the book was relatively modest. After months of research and agency-wide consultations, Sherman Kent, the so-called ‘father of intelligence analysis’, produced a lengthy scholarly rebuttal of Tully’s book. It was an exercise in extreme punctiliousness, running to forty-eight pages in length with an entire section devoted to pointing out Tully’s spelling mistakes, followed by seven pages of bullet-points that simply listed all the factual inaccuracies in Tully’s account. Kent also dedicated considerable space to placing excerpts from Tully’s book side-by-side with the original sources they were based upon, essentially accusing Tully of extensive plagiarism. Like Dulles, Kent condemned Tully’s reliance on Soviet propaganda, describing it as ‘the tired old space garbage that circles in the wake of a secret organization. It passes from journalist to propagandist to journalist again . . . It is a bad book’, Kent concluded, ‘a shoddy piece of goods. From the purely technical point of view it is by all odds the worst bad book that this reviewer has ever encountered’.34 Kent published the review in the CIA’s in-house classified journal, that he edited, Studies in Intelligence. Kirkpatrick’s plan, however, was to have the article declassified, and to distribute a hundred copies of it to influential diplomats, politicians, and journalists. In addition, he recom­ mended a campaign of persuasion to convince influential figures in government, ‘and perhaps to a certain extent . . . publishers and reputable journalists’, that ‘this book is the complete phony document that it is’.35 After serious consideration of Kirkpatrick’s proposals, however, McCone demurred, fearing that any CIA response would simply draw more attention to the book, which by the time Kent had compiled his review, had slipped off the bestseller list. McCone also noted that many of the people he had discussed the book with believed it was, on the whole, quite positive about the CIA, despite Tully’s occasional relaying of anti-CIA Soviet propaganda.36 Clearly the research materials that the CIA had passed to Tully had some impact. But if McCone thought that 286 S. WILLMETTS the disappearance of The Inside Story from the bestseller list was the last time he would have to deal with a bestselling critical history of the CIA, he was mistaken. The next popular histories of the Agency to be published in the wake of the Bay of Pigs, unlike Tully, would pull no punches in their criticism of the Agency, and firmly establish the idea in the American psyche that the CIA constituted an invisible government, capable of directing America’s foreign policy from behind the scenes. In the spring of 1964, the CIA quietly obtained advanced copies of two manuscripts that, upon publication, might further damage the Agency’s public reputation. The first of these was a history of the Bay of Pigs invasion by the Washington Evening Star columnist Haynes Johnson.37 What made Johnson’s account unique, was that, unlike previous books about the CIA, it was based almost entirely on unofficial sources, and Johnson received no help from the Agency in putting his account together. This represented a decisive break from the previous era when official support or endorse­ ment was almost a pre-requisite for non-fiction accounts of the secret state to be taken seriously.38 Instead of interviewing CIA leadership, or other officials in Washington, Johnson told his story from the perspective of the Cuban exiles who fought in the invasion, and who were recently freed by Castro from Cuban prisons in exchange for a ransom of $53 million in food and medical supplies.39 As an internal CIA memo pointed out, the book was potentially damaging in several respects. First, and perhaps most problematic for the Agency, the book claimed that CIA planners had told the exile forces to ‘go ahead and land even if Washington canceled (sic) the operations’.40 As one reviewer later put it, perhaps Johnson’s most serious charge in the book is that ‘the CIA operated as an imperium in imperio’, or in other words, an ‘invisible government’ willing to ignore and override orders from Washington. But despite Johnson’s criticism of the CIA’s involvement in the Bay of Pigs, his criticism of the Agency was not unwavering, and in his conclusion he reiterated the essential role the CIA played in maintaining the security of the United States. The CIA’s attempts to censor “the Invisible Government” Unlike Johnson’s book, the other pre-publication manuscript that the CIA had obtained in the spring of 1964 pulled no punches in its criticism of the Agency. David Wise and Thomas Ross’ The Invisible Government is one of the two or three most important books ever written about the CIA. It had a profound impact, demonstrably altering attitudes towards the CIA at a pivotal moment in the history of US foreign policy, and the American people’s attitudes towards that policy. A few months after the book’s publication, an incident in the Gulf of Tonkin provided President Johnson with a pretext to commit conventional US military forces to open warfare in Vietnam. It was that war, more than anything else, that altered the American people’s attitudes towards the US foreign policy establishment, including the CIA. And it was The Invisible Government, more than any other book about the Agency in this period, that became a key text for student protestors and the anti-war movement. In clipped prose The Invisible Government outlined the history of CIA covert operations. Contrary to the claims of the book’s many critics within the intelligence community, the authors did not deny that these operations were authorized at the highest level by the President and his ‘Special Group’ of advisors. Nor did it argue that the CIA set its own policy. This latter claim, according to Wise and Ross, was ‘oversimplified’. What they did argue, however, was that within the broad parameters laid down by the President and his advisors, the CIA had considerable room to ‘shape events in the field’, and to ‘influence policy and chart their own course within the flexible framework laid down by Washington’.41 It was not as radical of a book as its critics later perceived, but that was not how the CIA saw it, and the nuances of its argument would get lost in the furor that accompanied the book’s release. Sometime in late April 1964 the CIA surreptitiously obtained a pre-publication copy of The Invisible Government. Immediately, DCI John McCone ordered the formation of a CIA task force on the book to determine its implications for the Agency. Over a single frantic weekend the task force reviewed the manuscript. The Office of Security were drafted in to assess the damage, but INTELLIGENCE AND NATIONAL SECURITY 287 they could not ‘identify any specific security violation breached’ and therefore concluded that the ‘chances of prosecution, particularly of a successful one, were not very high’. Despite their inability to identify any specific threats to national security posed by the book’s publication, the task force nevertheless recommended that ‘an approach at the highest level to the book publisher be considered, either to stop the book from being printed or to have deletions of at least some of the material’ on the grounds that it was ‘most harmful’. This appeal, they concluded, should be ‘made in the name of national interest’. They cautioned, however, that the CIA would need to play dumb in their initial approach to the publisher, and request a copy of the manuscript, ‘since the present one was gotten through irregular channels’. If this approach failed, they concluded, ‘CIA may have to secure unfavorable book reviews’ from ‘such assets as CIA may have’ in order to ‘lessen the book’s impact and to cast doubt on the validity of its claims’.42 The Agency’s campaign to discredit The Invisible Government in the American press was, however, a consequence of their failure to prevent its publication. Throwing caution to the wind, Director John McCone invited the authors to a meeting a few months prior to the book’s publication. He told them that the book would certainly damage US national security, and would provide ‘a vast stockpile of material for critical speeches and editorials’ in nations unfriendly to the United States.43 According to Wise, McCone then produced a list of 10 national security breaches that the CIA wanted removed from the book. Noting that the list was stamped ‘Top Secret’, Wise refused to look at it, and said that he could not possibly leave the Agency’s headquarters building with it in his possession. Lyman Kirkpatrick then appeared with a pair of scissors and snipped off the classification markings.44 The authors refused to cooperate with the CIA’s request. Undeterred, McCone approached Mike Cowles, a co-founder and editor of Look Magazine that was due to serialise the book, and asked him to stop publication, or to remove sections that were potentially damaging. ‘I think you are unduly agitated about [Wise and Ross’] story’, was Cowles’ sharp reply, ‘my observation of the material is there is little told that is new’.45 The next stop was the book’s publisher, Random House. McCone approached one of their editors, Robert Loomis, and pleaded with him to remove damaging sections in the book, even threatening him with the Espionage Act. In fairness, the CIA did offer to compensate the publisher for revenues lost by buying up all 2000 pre-publication copies of the book.46 Loomis and Random House chose instead to persevere with publication.47 Failing these personal overtures to the authors and their publishers, the CIA’s lawyers went to the Department of Justice, and asked the Assistant Attorney General to put out a temporary restraining order. It would have been a remarkable move, pre-empting Nixon’s famous showdown with the American press over the publication of the Pentagon Papers more than seven years later. The Assistant Attorney General’s office advised the CIA that such an injunction might be possible, but eventually the CIA’s leadership balked, fearing that a prolonged legal battle would simply provide additional publicity for the book.48 In a last ditch attempt to head off the book before its release, McCone approached the President of the United States, Lyndon Baines Johnson, and asked him to hold a news conference at which he would publicly condemn the book. Johnson, ‘ever attuned to his personal image’, demurred.49 Realising they had failed to prevent The Invisible Government’s publication, the CIA went into damage limitation mode, and instigated its previously stated ‘plan B’, by mobilizing friendly CIA assets in the media to discredit the book. According to veteran CIA clandestine operative Joseph Burkholder Smith, ‘[a]ll stations were deluged with dispatches giving instructions how to handle the matter’. The CIA’s propaganda section wrote fake book reviews, and sort to get them published in the foreign press.50 Another CIA asset prepared a review and sent it to Life Magazine. They rejected it, so they then submitted it to Reader’s Digest.51 The CIA also leaked information to friendly journalists, including Marquis Childs who reported that ‘high government officials’ had revealed that the book contained 112 breaches of security, some of them serious’.52 Numerous other press reports citing ‘intelligence sources’ or ‘government officials’ reported similar security breaches.53 This contradicted 288 S. WILLMETTS the CIA’s own internal review by the Office of Security which concluded that no security breaches could be found in the book. The CIA’s campaign against the book, both before and after its publication, failed. It was profoundly influential, a bestseller in the United States, and with the help of Soviet propagandists and prominent leaders of the decolonization movement, it also achieved worldwide influence. What made its impact so long-lasting, however, was its timeliness. Upon its release, in 1964, John Le Carré’s sinister vision of Western espionage in the Cold War in his landmark novel The Spy Who Came in From the Cold topped the fiction bestseller list. For a while, The Invisible Government hovered around the top of the non-fiction bestseller list, whilst Le Carré’s equally damning vision of Western intelligence sat stop the fiction list. Attitudes were beginning to change. The tide was about to turn. In the years that followed the book’s release the United States’ deepening involvement in the Vietnam War, accompanied by frequent revelations of sinister secret state activity in the United States confirmed the ‘invisible government’ thesis in many Americans’ minds. It became a clarion call for the anti-war movement and helped budding conspiracy theorists hone and lend weight to their claims that a hidden government hand was behind President Kennedy’s assassination. The ‘deep state’ narrative was starting to take hold, and despite their best efforts, the CIA had failed in their attempts to block the publications of one of its foundational texts. A lasting legacy: the widespread influence of the Invisible Government The Invisible Government had an immediate impact upon public discussions about intelligence and covert operations. It shot to the top of the non-fiction bestseller lists in many newspapers, although much to the authors chagrin, remained in the number two spot on the New York Times’ bestseller list for 22 weeks, second only to Ernest Hemingway’s Movable Feast. ‘We were a bit disappointed’, recalled Wise, ‘but . . . if we had to be second to someone, Hemingway was it’.54 The book’s critical reception was polarized, revealing a nascent faultine in American society between those critical of American foreign policy and its institutions, and those who sought to defend it. Ben Badikian’s review in the New York Times, for example, highlighted the book’s central significance in disabusing the American population of the naïve belief that the United States were not involved in aggressive covert operations. Until very recently, Badikian noted, it was perfectly reasonable for members of Congress and the general public to be entirely naïve of CIA covert operations, and assume they were not engaged in them. ‘Today this . . . would be so naïve as to border on the stupid’, Bedikian remarked. ‘In 1964 every serious newspaper reader knows that American agencies are engaged in “operational activities” – secret manipulations and subversion of foreign societies – all over the world, not only keeping others from doing unto us but also doing unto others’.55 William Buckley Jr., the renowned conservative commentator and former CIA officer, was less sympathetic: ‘the thesis that the CIA is an invisible government is so palpably absurd that one must conclude that the purpose of the book, notwithstanding its sanctimonious pretentions, is simply to make a little scandal, and make a little money’. Buckley repeated the claim made by Marquis Childs that the book contained serious security breaches, including ‘naming 26 persons who are CIA agents in deep cover’. Though it appears that the CIA leaked this claim to Childs and other friendly journalists, their own Office of Security could find no security breaches, and Random House strenuously denied the allegation.56 John Chamberlain, a veteran reporter and one of Buckley’s close friends, also penned an article for his syndicated column defending the CIA. He described Wise and Ross’ anti-CIA attacks as a ‘contagion’ that was spreading dangerously across American society, which risked undermining one of the nation’s strongest bulwarks against the Soviet Union.57 ‘Contagion’ was of course a loaded term; it was a common Cold War metaphor to describe the spread of communism.58 But the book was certainly influential, including among Soviet propagan­ dists and domestic protest movements in the United States that the U.S. intelligence community and many of its defenders in the press deemed suspicious. In 1966, for example, a wave of anti-CIA protests on university campuses were directly inspired by Wise and Ross’ account. One of the first INTELLIGENCE AND NATIONAL SECURITY 289 took place in February 1966 at Grinnell College, Iowa. A group of students picketed a presentation by a CIA recruiter, holding signs reading ‘Where there is an invisible government there is no democracy’.59 The students also lifted their central point of contention with the CIA from the pages of Wise and Ross’ book: ‘Our main concern is that, rather than relaying the information gathered through its intelligence operations to responsible government officials, the agency fre­ quently takes action on its own . . . ’60 Later that year students at Boston University staged a similar protest. They produced an information pamphlet on the history of CIA covert action, and cited Wise and Ross at length, again echoing the argument that the CIA had acted outside the authority of elected officials: ‘Time after time the C.I.A. has created American policy’, they wrote, and listed examples lifted directly from The Invisible Government where Wise and Ross argued that the Agency had acted without informing relevant policymakers.61 The ‘Contagion’ begun by Wise and Ross soon spread to numerous other college campuses. Almost invariably, the pamphlets the students pro­ duced to rationalize their anti-CIA protests cited The Invisible Government, with some borrowing the same title.62 Students at Emory University, for example, having already quoted liberally from Wise and Ross, charged that the ‘CIA is guilty of putting its own institutional interests above that of the American people. It is guilty of sabotage of our foreign policy when such policy does not agree with its own’.63 Other student protestors, although still greatly indebted to The Invisible Government, took a slightly different position. For example, in February 1968, amidst the Tet offensive that would dramatically undermine public support for the war in Vietnam, the Wisconsin chapter of the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) produced a pamphlet titled ‘The CIA: Or Who Was that Dictator I Seen Ya With?’ The pamphlet repeated many of the charges from Wise and Ross’ history, and cited it as the most significant source upon which the pamphlet was based. However, instead of regarding the CIA as a rogue organization that corrupted US foreign policy, they instead saw the former as the apotheosis of the latter: The CIA is not an aberration in an otherwise democratic society. The point is not that the CIA has been an ‘invisible government’, nor that it has dictated American foreign policy, but that its activities constitute a particularly outrageous aspect of that policy. It is an internal part of a political and economic system which oppressed and misleads its own people just as it does the people of other lands for the benefit of those whose profits come from racism and exploitation. It is because the SDS opposes this system of exploitation and racism that it opposes the CIA.64 The SDS’ more systemic critique of the CIA that was nevertheless still indebted to The Invisible Government was shared by other influential critics of U.S. foreign policy in this era. Influential world leaders and several major voices for the decolonization movement often invoked The Invisible Government to support their claims that the United States were engaged in a form of neo- colonialism. CIA covert operations, which often targeted former European colonies in the developing world, were regarded as imperial interventions, replacing the cruder and more overt forms of European colonialism from the previous age of empires. Kwame Nkrumah, for example, the President of Ghana and a leading pan-Africanist, published an influential book in 1965 titled Neo Colonialism: The Last Stage of Imperialism, which cited The Invisible Government at length in support of its thesis that Western powers, and particularly the United States, continued to dominate and dictate life in ostensibly post-colonial nations.65 The ‘extended tentacles of the Wall Street octopus’, he wrote, with ‘its suction cups and muscular strength are provided by a phenomenon dubbed “The Invisible Government” . . . ’66 Admittedly, the CIA were frequently attacked in the Ghanaian media even prior to the publication of The Invisible Government. In February and March 1963, a series of articles in the Ghanaian press accused the CIA of assassinating Premier Qassim in Iraq. One article in the Ghana Evening News was headlined ‘Neo-Colonialist Terror in Iraq Menacing Threat Against Africa’. The weekly Ghanaian newspaper Spark also carried a front page story titled ‘The Secret War of CIA: The Killer at Your Door’, which noted that ‘[t]he murderous game, which goes by the innocent- sounding name of intelligence, has its Western-world nerve-centre in America’s Central Intelligence Agency . . . ”’67 The Invisible Government, it seemed, gave credence and a powerful narrative 290 S. WILLMETTS framework to an idea that was already taking root in Ghanaian society. Nkrumah was not the only leading figure in the decolonization movement to cite The Invisible Government. The first President of Algeria Ahmed Ben Bella, Indonesia’s Foreign Minister Subandrio, and of course, Fidel Castro, all cited the book at length in support of their protests against US-led neocolonialism.68 The CIA believed, accurately, that The Invisible Government would be a great boon for Soviet propagandists, and much of their criticism of the book internally, and to friendly journalists, emphasized this.69 The State Department likewise issued a circular telegram to all American diplo­ mats and consular staff, warning that the book would likely damage the American image abroad, and advised them to ‘muffle’ the impact of the book ‘as far as possible’ by avoiding statements or actions that might arouse further curiosity in it.70 Their fears were soon realized when the Soviet press jumped on the book with relish. Pravda journalist Victor Maevsky, for example, borrowed heavily from Wise and Ross’ account to pen a history of controversial CIA covert interventions.71 When Admiral Raborn replaced John McCone as the Director of Central Intelligence in the spring of 1965, The Invisible Government provided another Pravda journalist with a framing device to cast Raborn’s links to big business as sinister: ‘For good reason the CIA is called the “invisible govern­ ment” of the United States and the “state within a state”. Behind the scenes there was . . . a bitter struggle of the owners of big industrial concerns for the right to place their own man at the helm of this spy state. And the choice fell on Raborn, the president of a gigantic corporation . . . ’72 Media outlets in Eastern bloc countries also used the occasion of The Invisible Government’s publication to mount attacks against the CIA. One Romanian journalist, for example, concluded that the title of Wise and Ross’ book ‘admirably reflects the position occupied by the CIA in the United States.73 In Slovakia, the Hungarian language daily newspaper of the Slovakian communist party, Slovak Daily, published an entire series of articles on the CIA inspired by The Invisible Government.74 In response to this global impact of Wise and Ross’ book, DCI John McCone ordered a ‘comprehensive report’ to be written on the ‘usages of “The Invisible Government” by unfriendly countries for unfriendly purposes or for unfriendly purposes by friendly countries – in other words, all inclusive’. The Director added that although the exact use to which the report would be put was yet to be determined, it was very likely that portions of it ‘might be made a matter of public disclosure and it is therefore essential to annotate sources as well as to indicate the possible sensitivity of source disclosure’.75 Later that year, the CIA released the report to friendly journalists, leading to a raft of stories in the American press reporting on the Soviet Union’s anti-CIA disinformation campaign, and citing The Invisible Government as a favourite source of Soviet propagandists.76 Perhaps the most lasting legacy of The Invisible Government was its impact upon conspiracy theories, and what would later become the ‘deep state’ narrative. The book was published less than a year after the Kennedy assassination, when many Americans were still coming to terms with the President’s death. Conspiracy theories, including those alleging CIA involvement in Kennedy’s death, emerged almost immediately, though they grew in popularity as the long 1960s wore on.77 Anxieties about government secrecy, piqued by The Invisible Government, compounded popular suspicions that Kennedy had died at the hands of a conspiracy, perhaps orchestrated by the invisible government itself. The CIA and the FBI’s reticence in the face of the Warren Commission enquiry, refusing, for example, to share details of the CIA’s attempts to assassinate other foreign leaders, or their surveillance of Kennedy’s assassin Lee Harvey Oswald in the months prior to the event, suggested to some that they had something else to hide. When these revelations of CIA assassination plots and other details they had withheld from the Warren Commission were made public during the 1975 Congressional enquiries into the activities of the US intelligence community, some began to question why the CIA had refused to cooperate with the commission. Thus, The Invisible Government was published at the beginning of an era of public revelations about the more nefarious activities of the US intelligence community, espe­ cially the CIA. Its central thesis, when read retrospectively through the lens of these subsequent scandals that seemed to implicate the CIA in a whole range of morally questionable activities, was easily exaggerated into an all-encompassing explanation for the moral quagmire into which INTELLIGENCE AND NATIONAL SECURITY 291 US foreign policy seemed to be slipping. For popularizers of ‘deep state’ Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories like Hollywood director Oliver Stone, the explanation for this descent was simple: Kennedy represented the myth of Camelot, a young and idealistic President who, had he lived, would have avoided the disastrous intervention in Vietnam. The CIA, among other shady benefactors of the military-industrial-complex, wanted war in Vietnam. And so they killed the President. For Stone this was personal. As a Vietnam war veteran he regarded the Kennedy assassination as the event that sealed his fate, committing him as a young enlistee to fight in an immoral war. What Stone, and other popularizers of this myth ignore, of course, is that Kennedy’s record in Vietnam was one of escalating U.S. involvement, and that his record suggested that he was certainly not a ‘dove’ in his foreign policy.78 Stone’s 1991 drama J.F.K. popularized this particular Kennedy assassination conspiracy theory for a new generation. But it was a narrative that was by then decades old. Stone’s film romanticized the efforts of New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison to prosecute David Ferrie for Kennedy’s assassination. Garrison insinuated that Ferrie had been part of a much greater government con­ spiracy instigated by secretive government officials. Garrison used The Invisible Government as part of his background research in preparation for the trial, and was clearly inspired by it. In a book he published shortly after the trial, Garrison repeatedly uses the term ‘invisible government’ to describe the development of the US intelligence apparatus after the war, concluding that the Warren Commission had ‘validated the existence and ascendancy of invisible government in the United States’.79 Though Garrison had not used this line in his closing argument at Ferrie’s trial, Oliver Stone lifted this quote almost verbatim in his dramatization of Garrison’s speech to the courtroom, which forms the film’s emotional apogee and denouement: ‘Who determines our “national security”?’, asks Kevin Costner’s Garrison to a packed courtroom in the film’s final scenes. ‘What “national security” permits the removal of fundamental power from the hands of the American people and validates the ascendancy of the invisible government in the United States?’80 Another inspiration for Stone’s film was another well-known popularizer of the ‘invisible government’ or ‘deep state’ JFK conspiracy theory: Leroy Fletcher Prouty.81 In his 1973 book The Secret Team he cites The Invisible Government as one of the central inspirations for his own thesis, describing it as ‘that most valuable book’ that first outlined and provided the descriptive vocabulary for understanding the presence of an unaccoun­ table secretive elite within the United States intelligence community, capable of influencing and even directing US policy.82 These influences demonstrate the profound legacy of Wise and Ross’ book. But they were not necessarily legacies of their own making. Propagandists, politicians and conspiracy theorists exag­ gerated The Invisible Government’s eponymous thesis for their own purposes. What began as a still somewhat measured critique of the CIA’s lack of accountability, was repeatedly invoked to support more radical conspiracy theories that saw a secret cabal dictating American history and foreign policy, up to and including the assassination of the President. In this sense, the CIA and the State Department were right – Wise and Ross had provided grist for the Soviet propagandists’ mill, and damaged the United States’ image abroad, and at home for that matter. But the CIA’s contention that this might justify censorship, regardless of the lack of any evidence of security breaches in the book, was a dangerous proposition, implying that the United States government could veto uncomfortable narratives, even if the facts mobilized to support a particular story were true. Moreover, if the threshold for censorship was the inclusion of arguments that might be harnessed by enemies of the United States, then virtually any narrative critical of U.S. policy could be banned. As Tully remarked in response to the CIA attacks on his own far-from-radical history of the Agency: ‘surely we are past the time when all that is necessary to discredit a work is to say that it says what communists say. The question is not who says what, but whether what is said is so’.83 Although, as was customary when the CIA reviewed books that it objected to, the Agency punctiliously identified ‘several hundred petty errors on such matters as dates and alleged statements of fact which are actually one individual’s opinion’, they also conceded that the book was ‘in general accurate and revealing’.84 292 S. WILLMETTS This final acknowledgment unsettled the Agency. As one senior CIA officer reflected in his notes on the book, made in preparation for the Deputy Director: I still find it very difficult in my own mind (and I think this is true of most others in the Agency as well) to determine or define what really constitutes a security breach or a damaging revelation in a book like ‘The Invisible Government’. We all agree that such books are terrible and damaging but we don’t have any professional definition of what makes them so .85 Perhaps part of this confusion was a failure to come to terms with the fact that a book like The Invisible Government might be ‘terrible and damaging’ for the CIA, without containing direct security breaches, as the Agency’s own security office conceded. This was perhaps because the CIA were still relatively unaccustomed to such negative publicity about their covert operations. In this respect Wise and Ross had written a landmark text. Only later, via lawsuits against apostate CIA officers like Victor Marchetti and Frank Snepp, as well as major First Amendment rulings such as the Pentagon papers trial, would some of the ambiguities around which ‘terrible and damaging’ books could be censored, and which could not, would be clarified. Nevertheless, The Invisible Government was an important early example of a book that probed the boundaries of freedom of speech and national security. Perhaps more importantly, it provided the content, language and a narrative framework that would inspire many future generations of CIA critics.

It describes not only the program's technological and bureaucratic aspects, but also its politi­ cal and international context. The manned reconnaissance program1 along with other overhead systems that emerged from il, changed the CIA's work and structure in ways that were both revolutionary and permanent. The formation of the Directorate of Science and Technology in the I~60s, principally to develop and direct reconnais­ sance programs, is the most obvious legacy of the events recounted in· this study.· The authors tell an engrossing story. The struggle between· the CIA and the US Air Force to control the U-2 and A-12 OXCART pr0jects reveals how the manned reconnaissance program confronted problems that still beset successor programs today. The U-2 was an. enormous technofogical success:" its first flight over the USSR in July 1956 made it immediately th~ most important source of intelligence on the Soviet Union. Using it against the Soviet target it was designed for nevertheless produced a persistent "tension between its program managers and the President The program managers, eager for cover­ age, repeatedly urged the ·President to authorize frequent missions over the Soviet Union. President Eisenhower, from the outset doubt­ ful of the ·prudence and propriety of invading Soviet airspace, only reluctantly allowed any overflights at all. After the Soviets shot down Francis Gary Powers' U-2 on I May 1960, President Eisenhower forbade any further U-2 flights over· the USSR. Since the Agency must always assess a covert operation's potential payoff against the diplomatic or l!lilitary cost if it fails, this account of the U-2's em­ ployment over the Soviet Union offers insights that go beyond overhead reconnaissance progra111s. Indeed, this study should be useful for a variety of purposes. It is the only history of this program based upon both full access to CIA . records and extensive classified interviews of its participants: The authors have found records that were nearly irretrievably lost and have interviewed participants whose personal recollections gave in· formation available nowhere else. Although the story of tlie manned Scc1.et ;. . ' : I reconnaissance program offers no tidy model for imitation, it does reveal how resourceful managers coped with unprecedented techno­ logical challenges and their implications' for inielligence and national· policy. For this reason, the program's history provides profitable reading for intelligence professionals and policymakers today. Many people made important ccintributions to the production of r-~--_IJ Withheld under statutory authority of the Central Intelligence Agency Act of 1949 (50 U.S.C., section 403g) this volume .. In the History Staff's pre aration of 'the manuscript, Gerald Haines 'did the final revision, a· ain demon- .straled her high talent as acopy editor, and provided staunch secretarial support throughout. As usual, we are indebted to more members Lhan we can riame from Lhe Publications, Design, and Cartography Centers in the Office of Current Production and Analytic . . Support, whose lively interest in the publication went far.beyond the call of duty. Their exceptional professional skill and the masterly work of the Printing and Photography Group combined to create this handsome volume. Donald E. Welzenbach, who began this study, and Gregory W, Pedlow, who completed it, brought complementary strengths to this work. A veteran of CIA service since 1960, Mr. Welzenbach began researcli on this study in 1983, when he joined the DC! History Staff on a rotational· assignment from the Directorate of Science and Technology. After tireless documentary research and extensive inter­ viewing, he finished a draft manuscript of the history before returning to his directorate. In early 1986, Gregory W. Pedlow, a new member of the DCJ History Staff, was assigned to complete the study. A Johns Hopkins University Ph.D. who has served as an Army intelligence officer and University of Nebraska professor of history, Dr. Pedlow undertook important research in several new areas, and reorganized, edited, and revised the entire manuscript before leaving CIA to. be­ come NATO Historian in late 1989.

Seti ct NOFORN PREFACE When the Central Intelligence Agency came irito existence in 1947, no one foresaw that, in less than a decade, it would undertake a major progra1n of overhead reconnaissance, whose principal purpose. would be to fly over the Soviet Union. Traditionally, the military services had been responsible for overhead reconnaissance, and flights deep into unfriendly territory only took .place during wartime. By the early 1950s, however, the United States had an urgent and growing need for strategic intelligence on the Soviet Union and its satellite states. At great risk, US Air Force and Navy aircraft· had been conducting peripheral reconnaissance and shallow-penetration overflights, but these missions were paying a high price in lives lost and increased interilational tension. Furthermore, many important areas of the Soviet Union lay beyond the range of existing reconnais­ sance aircraft. The Air Foree had therefore beguo to develop a high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft that would be able to conduct deep-penetration reconnaissance missions over the Soviet Union. President Dwight D. Eisenhower and his civilian scientific advisers feared that the loss of such an aircraft deep in Soviet territory could lead to war and therefore authorized the development of new non­ military aircraft, first the U-2 and later the A-12 OXCART, to be manned by civilians and operated only under cover and in the greatest secrecy. Primary responsibility for this new reconnaissance program was assigned to the Central Intelligence Agency, but the Air Force provided vital support. The Agency's maimed overhead reconnaissance program lasted 20 years. It began with President Eisenhower's authorization of the U-2 project in late 1954 and ended witl1 the transfer of the remaining Agency U-2s to the Air Force in 1974. During chis period the CIA developed a successor ~o the U-2, the A-12 OXCART, but this ad­ vanced aircraft saw little operational use and the program was canceled iri 1968 after the Air Force deployed a fleet of similar air-~ craft, a military varianc of rhe A-12 called rhe SR-71. Neither of these aircrafr remains secret today. A grea! deal of in­ formation about the U-2 and its overflight program became known to ;: ... the public after I May 1960, when the Soviet Union shot down a CIA U-2 and publicly tried its pilot, Francis Gary Powers. Four years later, at. press conferences in February and July 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson revealed t)le existence of lhe OXCART-type of aircraft, although only in its µiilitary YF-12A (interceptor) and SR-71 (strategic reconnaissance) versions. The two CIA reconnaissance aircraft have also been the subject of a number of books, beginning with David Wise's and Thomas B.' , Ross's The U-2 Affair 'in 1962 and· then Francis Gary Powers' memoirs, Operation Overflight, in 1970. 1\vei recent books give many more details about the U-2 and OXCART aircraft: Michael. Beschloss's Mayday: Eisenhower, Khrushchev and the U-2 Affair . (1986) and 'William' Butrows's De~p B(acjc:' SpacJ'·F:spionage an'd. Naiional Security (1987). Although well writien and generally ac­ curate, these books suffer from their authors' lack of access. to classified official documentation. By drawing upon the considerable amount of formerly classified data on the U-2 now available to the public, Reschloss has provided an accurate and insightful depiction of the U-2 program in the context of the Eisenhower admfnistration's overall foreign policy, but his book does contain errors and omissions on some aspects· of the U-2 program. Burrows's broader work suffers more from the lack of classified documentation, panicularly in the OX<;:ART/SR-71 section, which concentrates on the Air Force air­ craft because little information about the Agency's aircraft has been .officially declassified and released. After the present ~tudy of the Agency's overhead reconnaissance project~ was completed, a new book on the U-2· was published in the United Kingdom. Chris Pocock's Dragon Lady: The History of the U-2. Spyplane is by far the most accurate unclassified account of the U-1 program. Pocock has been able to compensate for his· lack of ac­ ' cess to classified documents by inter.viewing many former panicipants in the program, especially former pilots ..Pocock is also quite familiar with aircraft itself, for he bud worked with Jay Miller on the latter's excellent technical study of !he U-2: Lockheed U-2 (1983). . .

This 16-volume Top Secret Codeword study of the Agency's reconnaissance aircraft provides a wealth ·of tec!mical and operational information on the two projects but does not attempt to place them in their historical context. Without examining the international situation and bureaUcratic pressu-res af­ fecting the president and other key policymakers, however, it is impossible to understand the decisions thal began, carried out, and ended the CIA's reconnaissance aircraft projects. In preparing this study of ClA's overhead reconnai~sance pro­ gram, the authors drew .on published sources, classified ·government docu~ents, and interviews with key participants from the CIA, Air Force, contractors, scientific advisory committees, and the Eisenhower administration: The interviews were particularly impor­ tant for piecing together the story of how the CIA became involved in overhead reconnaissance in the first place because Agency documen­ tation o.n the prehistory of the U-2.project is very sketchy and there are no accurate published accounts. Research on the period of actual reconnaissance operations included the records of the Director of Central Intelligence, the Office of Special Activities in. the Directorate of Science and Technology, and the Intelligence Community Staff, along with documents from the Eisenhower Presidential Library in Abilene, Kansas, and additional interviews. Both authors are grateful for the assistance they have received from many individuals who played important roles in the events they recount. Without their help a good deal of this story could never have become known. The assistance of Agency records management officers in the search for documents ·On the overhead reconnaissance program is also greatly appreciated. ( To ensure that this study of the Agency's involvement in over­ head reconnaissance reaches the widest possible audience, the authors have kept it at the Secret classification level. As a result, some aspects of the overhead reconnaissance program, particularly those involving satellites and related interagency agreements, have had to be described in very general terms. The omission of such infonnation is not significant for.this book, which focuses on the Agency's recon­ naissance aircraft. + C01462740 SECRET See1 et NOFORN Chapter 3 1 >I·' . ~: ., Searching for a System THE NEED FOR HIGH-ALTITUDE RECONNAISSANCE For centuries, soldiers in wartime have sought the highest g19und or Structure in order to get a better view of the enemy. At first it was tall trees, then church steeple.5 and bell towers. l3y the time of the American Civil War and the Franco-Prussian War o( 1870-71, ob­ servers were using hot-air balloons to get up in the sky for a better view of the "other side of the. hill." With the advent of dry film, it became possible to carry cameras into the sky. to record the disposi­ tion of enemy troops and emplacements. Indeed, photoreconnaissance proved so valuable during World War I that in 1938 Gen. Werner von Fritsch, Commander in Chief of the German Army, predicted: "The nation with the best aerial reco1mai~sance facilities will win the next war." 1 By World War II, lenses, films, and cameras had undergone many improvements, as had the airplane, which could fly higher and faster than the primitive craft of World War I. Now it was possible to use · photo~econnaissance to obtain Jnformation aQ9ut potential targets be­ fore a bombing raid and to assess the effectiveness of the bombing afterward. Peacetime applications of high-altitude photography at first in­ cluded only photomapping and surveying for transcontinental high­ ways and mineral and oil exploration. There was little thought given to using photography for peacetime espionage until after World war·n, when the Iron Curtain.rang down and cut off most fo1ms of communi­ cation between the Soviet Bloc of nations and the .rest of the world. ~ ' ~ r. {<,, '~. -:1,.,, ~ ..·l '1' ..~ lp !J J/,i 'i• ·1; ,.

All Soviet strategic capabilities­ bomber forces, ballistic missiles, submarine forces, and nuclear weap­ ons plants-were concealed from outside observation. The Soviet air defense system,. a prime consideration in determining US retaliatory policies, was also largely an unknown factor. · Tight security along .the. Soviet Bloc borders severely curtailed the movement of human intelligenc.e sources. In addition, the Soviet Union made its conventional means of communication-telephone, telegraph, and radio-telephone-more secure, thereby greatly ·reduc­ ing the intelligence available from these sources. The stringent secu­ rity measures imposed by tl1e Communist Bloc nations effectively blunted traditional methods for gathering intelligence: secret agents using covert means to co1nmunicate intelligence, travelers to and from target areas who could be asked to keep their eyes open and re­ port tl1eir observations later, wiretaps and other eavesdropping meth­ ods, and postal intercepts. Indeed, the entire panoply of intelligence tradecrafr seemed ineffective against the Soviet Bloc, and no other methods were available. Early Postwar Aerial Reconnaissance Although at the end of World Wadi the United States had captured large quantities of German phoios and documents on. the Soviet Union, this material was rapidly becoming outdated. The main source' of current intelligence on the Soviet Union's military installations was inte1rogation of prisoners of war returning from Soviet captivity. To obtail) information about Soviet scientific progress, the intelligence community established several programs to debrief German scientists who had been taken to the Soviet Union after the end of the war but y,•ere now being. allowed to leave. 2 ~ At the end of World War II, the British had e~1ablisbed Project DRAGON co gain infor­ mation from German scientislS who had worked on the Pecncmundc rocket project, and the term DRAGON later was used to refer to individuals possessing scientific or technical infprmation.

In Octobt:r 1951, a .~eparate organizalion to exploit individuals with scientific or 1echnicill back.grounds, especi:illy German scienlists who had worked inside the Soviet Union, came into existence. ·n1it1 organization was known as the Returnee Exploitation Group (REG) and was located i'n Frankfurt.

Interrogation of returning Germans offered only fragmentary in­ formatio!l, and this' source could not be expected to last much longer. As a result, in the late 1940s, the US Air Poree and Navy began u·ying to obtain aerial photography of the Soviet Union. The main Air Force effort involved Boeing RB-47 aircmft (the reconnaissance version of the B-47 jet-propelled medium bomber) equipped with cameras and electronic "ferret" equipment that enabled aircrews to detect tracking by Soviet radars. At that time the Soviet Union had no! yet com­ pletely ringed its borders with radars;·and much of the interior also lacked radar coverage. Thus, when the RB-47s found a gap in the air-warning network, they would dart inland to take photographs of any accessible targets. These "penetration photography" flights (called SENSTNT-sensitive intelligence-missions) occurred .along J" the northern and Pacific coasts of Russia. One RB-47 aircraft even managed to fly 450 miles inland and ppotogrnph the city. of lgarka in Siberia. Such intrusions brought protests from Moscow but no Soviet military response.' In 1950 there was a major chang~ in So.viet policy. Ai1' defense units became very aggressive in defending their airspace, attacking all aircraft that came near the borders of the ,Soviet Union.' On 8 April 1950, Soviet fighters shot down a US Navy Privateer patrol air~raft over the Baltic Sea. Following the outbreak of.die Korean war in June 1950, the Soviet Union extended its "severe air defense poiicy" to the Far East. In die autumn of 1951, Soviet aircraft downed a twin-en­ gine US Navy Neptune bomber ~ear Vladivostok. An RB-29 lost in the Sea of Japan on 13 June 1952 was probably also a victim of Soviet fighters. The United States was not the only country affected by die new aggressive Soviet.air defense policy;· Britain and Turkey also reported attacks on their planes.' " !

Two months laler, on 7 October 1952, Soviet fighter aircraft stalked ·and shot down a US RB-29 flying over Hokkaido. Aerial re­ connaissance of the Soviet Union and surrounding areas had b~co1nC a very dangerous business. Despite the growing risks associated with aerial reconnaissance of the Soviet Bloc, senior US officials strongly believed th.at such missions were necessary. The lack of information about the Soviet Union, coupled with the perception that it was an aggressive nation determined to expand its borders-a perception that had been greatly strengthened by the Soviet-backed North Korean invasion of South Korea in June 1950-increased US determination to obtain infonna­ tion about Soviet. intentions and capabilities and thus reduce tl1e dan­ ger of being surprised by a Soviet attack. \ New Approaches to Photoreconnaissance While existing Navy and Air Force aircraft were flying their risky re­ connaissance missions over the Soviet Union, the United States began planning for a more systematic and less dangerous approach using new technology. One of the leading advocates of the need for new, high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft was Richard S. Leghorn, a Massachusetts Institute o.f Technology graduate and ~mployec of Eastman Kodak who had commanded the Army Air Forces' 67th Reconnaissance Group in Europe during World War rr: After the war he returned to Kodak but maintained his· interest in photoreconnais­ sance. Leghorn strongly believed in the need for what he called pre-D-day reconnaissance, that is, reconnaissance of a potential enen1y before the outbreak of actual hostilities, in contrast lo combat reconnaissance in wartime. [n papers presented in 1946 and 1948, Leghorn argued that the United States needed to develop·such a capa­ bility, which would require high-altitude aircraft and high-resolution cameras. The outbreak of the Korean war gave· Leghorn an opportu­ nity to put his ideas into effect. Recalled to active duty by the Air Force, Lieutenant Col~nel .Leghorn became the head of' the Reconnaissance Systems Branch of the Wright Air Developm.ent Command al Dayton, Ohio, in April 1951.' 1, ' ·) ,.~ ;I ;; ' .·, ' \~; t•: y.,, .';'i '-!

Seeret ,.· •:t;:' C01462740 SECRET Seer et NOFORN Chapter 1 In Leghorn's view, altitude was the key to success for overhead reconnaissance..Since the best Soviet interceptor at that. time, the MIG-17, had to stmggle to reach 45,000 feet,' Leghorn reasoned that an aircraft that could exceed 60,000 feet would be safe from Soviet fighters. Recognizing. that the fastest way to produce a high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft was to modify an existing aircraft, he began looking ·for the highest flying aircraft available in the Free World. This search soon led him to a British t\Vin-engine medium bo1nber­ the Canberra-built by the English Electric Company. The Canberra had made its first flight in May 1949. Its speed of 469 knots (870 ki­ lometers per hour) and its service ceiling of 48,000 feet made the Canbcml a natural choice for high-altitude reconnaissance work. The Royal Air Force quickly developed a reconnaissance version of the Canberra, the PR3 (the.PR stood for photoreconnaissance), which be­ gan flying in March 1950.' At Leghorn's insistence, the Wright Air Development· Cornn1and invited· English Electric representatives to Dayton in the summer of 195 I to help find ways to make the Canbcrrh fly even higher. By this time the Air Force had already adopted the bomber version of the Canberra, which the Glenn L. Martin Aircraft Company was to produce under license as the B-57 medium bomb­ er. Leghorn and his English Electric colleagues designed a new. Canberra configuration with very long high-lift wings, new Rolls-Royce Avon-l09 engines, a solitary pilot, and an airframe. that was stressed to less than the standard military specifications. I.;eghom calculated thal a Canberra so equipped might reach 63,000 feet early in a long mission and as high as 67,000 feet as the declin­ ing fuel supply lightened the aircraft. He believed that such a modi­ fied Canberra could penetrate the Soviet ·Union and China for a radius of 800 miles from bases around their periphery and photo­ graph up to 85 percent of the intelligence targCts jn those countries. Leghorn persuaded his superiors to submit his suggestion to the Pentagon for funding.

P~a~i:i'iii.e·.ieconna~s~ sance missions, fpr he -l:ielieved· that all Air. Force reconnaissance aircraft should be capable of operating under wartime conditions. Pellegrini therefore insisted tlrnt Leghorn's design meet the specifica­ tions for combat aircraft, which required heavily stressed airframes, armor plate, and other apparatus that made an aircraft too heavy to reach the higher "altitudes necessary for safe overflights of the Soviet Bloc. The final result of Leghorn's concept after its alteration by Pellegrini's staff was tl1e RB.-570 in 1955, whose maximum altitude See1et co.1462740 si;;:CRET Soeret NOFORN Chapter 1 7 was only 64,000 feet. Meanwhile Leghorn, frustrated by the rejection of his original concept, had transferred to the Pentagon in early 1952 to work for Col. Bernard A. Schriever, Assistant for Development Planning to the Air Force's Deputy Chief of Staff for Development.' In his new position Leghorn became responsible for planning the Air Force's reconnaissance needs for the next decade. He worked closely with Charles F. (Bud) Wienberg-a colleague who'had fol­ lowed him from Wright Field-and Eugene P Kiefer, a Notre Dame-educated aeronautical engineer who had designed reconnais­ sance aircraft at the Wright Air Development Center during World War !I. All three of tl1ese reconnaissance experts believed that the Air Force should emphasize high-altitude photoreconnaissance. Underlying their advocacy of high~altitude photoreconnaissance was the belief that Soviet radars would not be able to track. aircraft flying ·above 65,000 feet. This assumption was based on the fact that the Soviet Union used American-built radar sets that had been sup­ plied under Lend-Lease during World War II. Although the SCR-584 (Signal Corps Radio) l.arget-tracking radar could track targets. up to 90,000_ feet, its high power consumption burned out a key component quickly, so this radar was normally not. turned on until an early warn­ ing radar had detected ·a target. The SCR-270 early warning radar could be left on for much longer periods and had a greate_r horizontal range (approximately 120 miles) but was limited by the curvature of the earth to a maximum altitude of 40,000 feet. As a result, Leghorn, Kiefer, and Wienberg believed that an aircraft that could ascend to 65,000 feet before entering an area being swept by the early warning radar would go undetected, because the target-tracking radars would not be activated.' · The problem wiU1 this assumption was that the Soviet Union; un­ like Britain and the United States, had continued to i1nprove radar technology after the end of World War II. Even after evidence of im­ proved Soviet radar capabilities became available, however, many ad­ vocates of high-altitude overflight continued to believe that ait·craft flying above 65,000 feet were safe from detection by Soviet radars.

In September 1952, the Air Research and Development Command gave the Martin Aircraft Company a contract to examine the high-altitude potential of the B-57 by modifying a single aircraft to give it long, high-lift wings and the American version of the new Rolls-Royce Avon-109 engine. These were the modifications that Richard Leghorn had suggested during.the previous year." At about the same time, another Air Force office, tlic Wright Air Development Command (WADC) in Dayton, Ohio, was also examin­ ing ways to achieve sustained flight at high altitudes. Working with two German aeronautical experts-Woldemar Voigt and Richard Vogt-who had come to the United States after World War II, Air Force Maj. John Seaberg advocated the development of a·new aircraft that would combine the high-allitude performance of the latest turbo­ jet engines with high-efficiency. wings in order to reach ultrahigh alti­ tudes. Seaberg, an aeronautical engineer for the Chance Vought .Corporation until his recall to active duty during the Korean war, was serving as assistant chief of the New Developments Office of WADC's Bombardment Branch. By March 1953, Seaberg had expanded his ideas for a high-alti­ tude aircraft into a con1plcte request for proposa~ for "an aircraft weapon system having an operational radius of 1".500 nm [nautical miles] and capable of conducting pre- and post-strike reconnaissance missions during daylight, good visibility conditions."

In July 1953, the Bell Aircraft Corporation of Buffalo, New York, and the Fairchild Engine and Airplane Corporation of Hagerstown,.Maryland, received study con­ tracts to develop an entirely new high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft. In addition, the Glenn L. Martin Company of Baltimore was asked to examine the possibility of improving the already exceptional high-al­ titude performance of the B-57 Canbe1Ta. By January 1954 all three firms had submitted their proposals. Fairchild's entry was a single-en­ gine plane known as M-195, which had a maximum altitude potential of 67,200 feet; Bell's was a twin-engine craft called the Model 67 (later the X-16), which had a maximum altitude of 69,500 feet; and Martin's design was a big-wing Yersion of the 3c57 called the Model 294, which was to cruise at 64,000 feet. ln March 1954, Seaberg and other engineers at Wright Field, having evaluated the three contend­ ing designs, recommended the adoption of both the Martin and Bell proposals. °They considered Martin's version of the B-57. an interim project that could be completed and deployed rapidly while the more advanced concept from Bell was still being developed." Air Force headquarters soon approved Martin's proposal to mod­ ify the B-57 and was very much interested in the Bell design. But word of the con1pet~tion for a new reconnaissance airplane had reached another aircraft manufacturer, the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation, which submitted an unsolicited design. Lockheed had first become aware of the reconnaissance aircraft competition in the fall of 1953. John H. (Jack) Carter, who had recently retired from the Air F01'ce to become the assistant director of Lockheed's Advanced Development Program, was in the Pen~1gon on business and dropped in to see Eugene P. Kiefer, an old friend and colleague from the Air Force's Office of Development 'Planning (n1ore commonly known as AFDAP fron1 its Air Force· office symbol). Kiefer told Carter about the competition for a high-flying aircraft and expressed the opinion that tqe Air Force was going about the search in the wrong way by requiring the new aircraft to be suit­ able for bolh strategic and tactical reconnaissance. Immediately after returning to California, Carter proposed to Lockheed Vice President L. Eugene Root (previously the top civilian official in the Air Force's Office of Development Planning) that 11 The, requesl for proposal, known as "Design Study Require1ne·nts, IdtinLilica!ion No. 53WC-16507;" has been reprinted in Miller, L-Ockheed U-2, pp. 10-11. 9 -: ,.

Carter noted that the proposed aircraft would have to rea'b altitudes of between 65, 000 and 70,000 feet and correctly forecast, "If exrren1e altitude perfonnance can be realized in a practical aircraft at speeds in the vicinity of Mach 0.8, it should be capable of avoiding virUially all Russian defenses ·until about 1960." Carter added, "To achieve these characteristics in an aircraft which will have a reasonably useful operational life during the period before J 960 )'Jill, of course, require very strenuous efforts and extraordinmy procedures, as well as nonstandard design philosophy." Some of the "nonstandard" design cbaracteristics suggested by Carter were the elimination of landing gear, the disregard of military specifications, and the use of very low Joa<\ factors. Carter's memorandum closed ·with a warning tl1at .time was of tl1e essence: "In order that this spe­ cial aircraft can have a reasonably !orig and useful life, it is obvious that its development must be greatly accelerated beyond that consid­ ered nonnal. 11 1 , Lockheed's semor officials approved Carter's proposal, and early in 1954 the corporation's besi aircraft designer-Clarence L. (Kelly) Johnson-began working on the project, then known .as the CL-282 but later to become famous under its Air Force designator­ the U-2. Already one of the world's leading aeronautical engineers, Kelly Johnson had many successful military mid civilian designs to his credit, including· the P-38, P-80, F-104, and Constellation. Johnson quickly came up with a radical design based upon the fuselage of the F-104 jet fighter but incorpo~ating a high-aspect-ratio sailplane wing. To save weight and thereby increase the aircraft's al­ titude, Johnson decided to stress the airframe to only 2.5 units of 'u Miller, l..ockheerl U-2, p. 12. " ',l " I '' Seeret SECRET C01462740 SECRET ,: gravity (g's) instead of the military specification strength of 5.33 g's. For the power plant he selected the General Electric J73/GE-3 nonaf­ terburning turbojet engine witn 9,300 pounds of thrust (this w_as the same engine he had chosen for the F-104, which had been the basis for the U-2 design)." Many of the CL-282's design features were adapted from gliders. Thus, the wings and tail were detachable. Instead of a conventional landing gear, Johnson proposed using two skis and a reinforced belly rib for landing-a common sailplane technique--and a jettisonable wheeled dolly for takeoff. Other fea­ tures included an unpressurized cockpit and a 15-cubic-foot payload area that could accommodate 600 pounds of sensors. The CL-282's maximum altitude would be just over 70,000 feet with a 2, 000-mi!e range. Essentially, Kelly Johnson had designed a jet-propelled glider.u Early in March 1954, Kelly Johnson submitted the CL-282 de­ sign to Brig. Gen. Bernard A. ·Schriever's Office of Development Planning. Eugene Kiefer and Bud· Wienberg studied the design and recommended .it to General Schriever, who then asked Lockheed to submit a specific proposal. In early April, Kelly Johnson pr~senled a full description of the CL-282 and a proposal fo1: the construction and n1ainlenance of 30 aircraft lo a group of senior Pentagon ofQcials that included Schriever's superior, Lt. Gen. Donald L. Putt, Deputy Chief of Slaff for Development, and Trevor N. Gardner, Special" Assistant for Research and Development to the Secretary of Lhe Air Force. Afterward Kelly Johnson noted that the civilian officials were very much interested in his design but the generals were not. 16 . The CL-282 design was also presented to the commander of the Strategic Air Command (SAC), Gen. Curtis E. LeMay, in early April by Eugene Kiefer, Bud Wienberg, and Burton Klein fro1n the Office of Kelly Johnson Seeret NOFORN Chapter 1 11 · :. '.i . .'

According to Wienberg, General LeMay stood up halfway through the briefing, took his cigar out of his mouth, and told the briefers that, if he wanted high-altitude photographs, he would put cameras in his B-36 bombers a0d added that he was not interested in a plane that had no wheels or guns. The general then left the room, re111arking that' the whole business was a waste of his time. 17 Meanwhile, the CL-282 design proceeded through the Air Force development channels aiid reached Major Seaberg at the Wright Air Development Command in mid-May. Seaberg and his colleagues care­ fully evaluated the Lockheed submission and finally rejected it in early June. One of their main reasons for doing so was Kelly Johnson's ·choice of the unproven General Electric 173 engine. The engineers at Wright Field considered the Pratt ·and Whitney J57 to be the most powerful engine available, and the designs from Fairchild, Martin, and Bell all incorporated tl1is engine. The absence of conventional landing gear was also a perceived shortcoming of the Lockheed design." . < . ' Another factor in the rejection of Kelly Johnson's submission was the Air Force preference.for multiengine aircraft. Air Force re­ connaissance experts had gained their practical experience during " C.

In addition, aerial photography experts in the late 1940s and early 1950s emphasized focal length as the primary factor in reconnaissance photography and, therefore, pre­ " ferred large aircraft capable of accommodating long focal-length cameras. This preference.reached an extreme in the early 1950s· with the development of the cumbersome 240-inch Boston camera, a de­ . vice so large that the YC-97 Boei~g Stratocruiser that carried it had to be partially disassembled before the camera could be installed. Finally, there was the feeling shared by many Air Force officers that two engines are always better than one because, if one fails, there is a spare to get the aircraft back to base. In reality, however, aviation re­ cords show that single-engine aircraft have always been more .reliable than mulriengine planes. Furthermore, a high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft deep in enemy territory would have little chance of returning if one of the engines failed, forcing the aircraft to descend." ( On 7 June .1954, Kelly Johnson received a Jetter from the Air Force rejecting tl1e CL-282 proposal because it had only one engine and was too an.usual and because the Air Force was already commit­ ted to the modification of the Martin B-57." By. this time, the Air Force had also selected the Bell X-16; the formal contract calling for 28 aircraft was signed in September. Despite the Air Force's selection of the X-16, Lockheed conlinued to work on the CL-282 and began seeking new sources of support for the aircraft. Lockheed CL-282 Supporters and th~_ CIA·'------- Allhough the Air Force's uniformed hierarchy had decided in favor of the Bell and Martin aircraft, so1ne high-level civilian officials contin­ ued to favor the Lockheed design. The mo.st prominent proponent. of the Lockheed proposal was Trevor Gardner, Special Assistant for Research and Development to Air Force Secretary Harold E. Talbott. Gardner had many contacts in west coast aeronautical circles because before coming to Washington he had headed the Hycon · Manufacturing Company, which n1ade aerial cameras in Pasadena, , . California. He.had been present at Kelly Johnson's pres'entation on the CL-282 at the Pentagon in early April 1954 and believed that this 19 Allen F. Donovan, interview by Donald E.

This belief was shared by Gardner's special assistant, Frederick Ayer, Jr., and .Garrison· Norton, an adviser to Secretary Talbott." According to Norton, Gardner. tried to interest SAC commander LeMay in the Lockheed aircraft because Gardner envisioned it pri­ marily. as a collector of strategic, rather than tactical, intelligence. But General LeMay had already shown that he was not interested in an unarmed aircraft Gardner, Ayer, and Norton then decided to seek CIA support for the high-Hying aircraft. At that time the Agency's official involven1ent in overhead reconnaiss~nce was limited to advising the Air Force on the problems of launching large camera-carrying bal­ loons for reconnaissance flights over hostile territory (for the details of this program, see ci1aptcr 2). The Chief Qf the Operations Staff in the Office of Scientific lntelJigence, Philip G_ Strong, however, served. on several Air Force advisory boards a~d kept himself well in­ formed on developments in reconnaiSsance aircraft. 22 Gardner, Norton, and Ayer met with Strong in the Pentagon on 12 May 195~, six days before the Wright Air Development Command began to evaluate the Lockheed proposal. Gardner described Kelly Johnson's proposal and showed the drawings to Strong. After this 1neeting, Strong sumn1arized his iJnpressions of !be Air Force's search for a high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft: Proposals for special reconnaissance aircraft have been re­ ceived in the Air Staff from Lockheed, FaircJiild, and Bell . .. _ The Lockheed proposal. i>" considered to be the best.

The Bell.proposal is a ntore conventional aircraft having nor­ mal landing gea"r. As a result, its maximun1 altitude over target is 69,500 feet and the speed and range are not as good as the Lockheed CL-282." · Gardner's enthusiasm for the CL-282 had given Strong the false impression that most Air Force officials supported the Lockheed de­ sign. In reality, ·the Air Force's uniformed hi"erarchy was in the pro­ cess of choosing the modified version of the Martin B-57 and the new Bell X-16 to incet future reconnaissance needs. During their meeting with Su·ong, Trevor Gardner, Frederick Ayer, and Garrison Norton explained that they favored the CL-282 because it gave promise of flying higher tlian the o_ther designs and because at inaxiinu1n altitude its stnaller radar cross section 1night make it invisible lo existing Soviet radars. The three officials asked Strong if the CIA would be interested in such an ajrcraft. Strong promised to talk to the Director of Central Intelligence's newly hired Special Assistant for Planning and Coordination, Richard M. Bissell, .Tr., about possible Agency interest in the CL-282." I Richard Dissell had already had an active and varied career be­ fore he joined the CIA. A graduate of Groton and Yale, Bissell stud­ ied at the London School of Economics for a year and then completed a doctorate at Yale in 1939. He .iaught economics, first at Yale and then from 1942 at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where he became a full professor in 1948. During World War JI~ Bissell had n1unaged American shipping as executive officer of the Combined Shipping Adjustment Board. After the war, he served as deputy director of tjle Marshall Plan from 1948 until the end of 1951, when he became a staff member of the Ford Foundation.

Bissell quickly concluded that there was not much hope for clandestine operations against Bloc nations. As he remarked. later: "I .know I emerged.from that exercise feeling that very little coula be done." This belief would later ·make Bissell a leading advocate of lechnicai" rather than hu111an nieans of intelligence collection.l.~ Bissell joined the Agency in late January 1954 and soon became involved in coordination for the operation ain1ed at overthrowing Guatemalan President Jacobo Arbenz. He was, therefore very preoc' cupied when Philip Strong approached him in mid-May 1954 with the concept of tl1e proposed spyplane from I .ockheed. Bissell said that the idea had merit and told Strong to get some topflight scientists to ad­ vise on the matter. Afterward he returned to the final planning for the Guatemalan operation and promptly forgot about the CL-282."' Meanwhile, Strong went. about drumming up support for high-al­ titude overflight. Tu May I 954 he persuaded DC! Allen W. Dulles to ask the A]r Force to t;ike the initiative in gaining approval fo1' an overflight of the Soviet guided-missile test range at Kapustin Yar. Dulles's memorandum did not mention the CL-282 or any of the other proposed high-altitude aircraft. CIA and Air Force officials met on several occasions to explore the overilight proposal, which the Air Force finally turned down in October .1954." · Although Allen Dulles was willing to support an Air Force over­ flight of the Soviet Union, he was not enthusiastic about the CIA un­ dertaking such a project. Few details about Dulles's precise attitude toward the proposed Lockheed rcconnaissarice aircraft are available, but many who kiiew him believe that he did not want the CIA lo be­ come involved in projects that belonged to the 0 military, and the Lockheed CL-282 had been designed for an Air Force requirement. ,_, Thomas Po_wers, The Man Who Kept tlte Secrets: Richard Helms and the CIA (New York: Alfred A.

He tendc~ to favor the classical form of espionage, which relied on agents rather than technology." · At this point, the summer of 1954, Lockheed's CL-282 proposal still lacked official support. Although the design had strong backers among some Air Force civilians and CIA officials, the key decisionmakers at both Air Force and CIA rern.ained unconvinced. To make Kelly Johnson's revolutionary design a reality, one additional source of support was necessary: pro1ninent scie1ltists serving on gov­ ernment advisory boards. SCIENTl.STS AND OVERHEAD RECONNAISSANCE Scientists and. engineers fro1n universities and private industry had played a inajor role in advising lhe government on technical 111atters during World War II. At the end of the war, most of the scientific ad­ visory boards were disbanded, but within a few y'ears the growing tensions of the Cold War again led gover111nent agencies to seek sci­ entific advice and assistance. In 1947 the 'Air Force estoblished a Scientific Advisory Board, which met periodically to discuss topics of current interest and advise the Air Force on the potential usefulness of new technologies. The foJlowing year the Office of Defense Mobilization established the Scientific Advisory Committee, but the Tru1nnn ad111inistration inade little use of this new advisory· body.29 DC/ Alie~ W.

By the end of the year, these experts had assembled in Boston to begin their research. Their head­ quarters was located over a secretarial school on Beacon Hill, which soon beca1n~ lhe codename for the ·reconnaissance project. The con­ . . . sultants were called the BEACON HILL Study Group. . The study group's chairman was Kodak physicist Carl F. P. Overhage, and its members included James G. Baker and Edward M.

Perkin of tlie Perkin-Elmer Company; and Louis N. ~idenour of Ridenour Associates, Inc. The Wright Air Development Command sent Lt. Col. Richard Leghorn to serve as its liaison officer." During January and February 1952, the BEACON HILL Study Group traveled every weekend ·to various airbases, laboratories, and firms for briefings on the latcs.t technology and projects. The panel members were particularly interested in new approaches to aerial re­ connaissance, such as photography from high-flying aircraft and camera-carrying balloons. One of \he more unusual (alb~it unsuccess­ ful) proposals examined by the p~nel was an "invisible" dirigible. This was to be a.giant, almost flat-shaped airship with a blue-tinted, nonreflective coating; it would cruise at an altitude of 90,000 feet along the borders of the Soviet Union at very slow speeds while using a large lens Lo photograph targets of interest."

Its 14 chapters covered radar, radio, and photo­ graphic surveillance; exan1ined the use of passive infrared and inicroWave reconnaissance; and discussed the develop1nent of ~d­ vanced reconnaissance vehicles. One of the report's key recommenda­ tions called for the developmen! of high-aJtitude reconnaissanc~ aircraft: We have reached a period in history ~vhen our peacetirne knowl­ edge of the capabilities, activities and dispositions of a poten­ tially hostile nation is such as to demand that we supplement it wi1h the 171axirnum a1nount of information obtdinable through aerial reconnaissanr:e. To avoid political involve1nents, such aerial reconnaissance must be conducted either j'rom vehicles flying in j"riendly airspace, or-a decision, on rhis point permitting--frmn vehicles whose performance is such that they can operate in Soviet airspace with greatly reduced chances of detection or interception. 11 Concern About the Danger of a Soviet Surprise Attack The Air Force did not begin to implement the ideas of the BEACON HILL Report until the summer of 1953. By this time interest in recon: naissancc had increased after Dwight D. Eisenhower became President in January 1953 and soon expressed his dissatisfaction with the quality of the intelligence estimates of Soviet strategic capabilities and the paucity of reconnaissance on the Soviet Bloc." To President Eisenhower and many other US political and mili­ tary leaders, the Soviet Union- was a .dangerous opponent that ap-· peared to be moving inexorably toward a position of military parity with the United States. Pa11icu(arly alarming was Soviet progress in .the area of nuclear weapons. In the late summer of 1949, the Soviet Union had detonated an atomic bomb nearly three years sooner than US expe11s had predicted. Then in August 1953-a scant nine months after the first US test of a hydrogen bomb-the Soviet Union deto­ nated a hydrogen bomb manufactured from lithiuindeuteride, a tech­ nology more advanced than the heavy water method _used by US ~ 2 IJEACON I/ILL Repon, pp. 164.

Thus, new and extremely powerful weapons were coming into the hands of a government whose actions greatly disturbed the leaders of the West. Only two months before the successful hydrogen bomb test, Soviet troops had crushed an uprising in East Berlin. And, at the United Nations, the Soviet Bloc seemed bent on causing dissen­ sion between Western Europe and the United States and between Lhe developed and undeveloped nations. This aggressive Soviet foreign policy, combined with advances in nuclear weapons, led officials such as Secretary of State John Foster Dulles to see the Soviet Union as a menace to peace and wo1:ld order. The Soviet Union's growing military strength soon became a threat·not just.to US forces overseas but to the continental United States itself. In the spring of 1953, a top secret RAND study pointed out the vulnerability of the SAC's US bases to a surprise attack by Soviet long-range bombers." · Concern about the danger of a Soviet attack on the continental United States grew after an American military attache sighted a new Soviet intercontinental bo1nber at Ra1uenskoye airfield, south of Moscow, in 1953. The new homher was the lvlyasishchev-4, later designated Bison by NATO. Powered by jet engines rather than the turboprops of Russia's other long-range bombers, tl1e Bison appeared to be the Soviet' equivalent of the US B-52, which was· only then going into production. Pictures of the Bison taken at the Moscow May Day air show in 1954 had an enormous impact on the US intel­ ligence community. Unlike several other Soviet postwar aircraft, the Bison was nol a derivative of US or British designs but represented a native Soviet design capability that surprised US intelligence ex­ perts. This new long-range jet bomber, along with the Soviet Union's large numbers of older propeller and turboprop bombers, seemed to pose a.significant threat to Lhe United States, and, in the su1n1ner of 1954, newspapers and·magazines began publishing articles highlight­ ing the growing airpower of the Soviet Uni01i.

Some of the schemes went be­ yond the existing level of technology; others, like the camera-carrying balloons, were technically feasible .but involved dangerous ·political consequences. British Overflight of Kapustin Var The British were also working on high-altitude reconnaissance air­ craft. In 1952 the Royal Air.Force (RAF) began Project ROBIN, which was designed to modify tl1e Canberra bomber for high-altitude reconnaissance. This project· was probably inspired .by Richard Leghorn's collaboration with English Electric Company designers in l 951, when they calculated ways to increas.e the altitude of the Canberra. The RAF equipped the new Canberra PR7 wilh Rolls­ Royce Avon-109 engines and gave it long, fuel-filled wings. The range.of this variant of the Canberra was now 4,300 miles, and, on 29 August 1955, it achieved an altitude of 65,880 feet." Sometime during the first half of 1953, the RAF employed a high-altitude Canberra 011 a daring overflight of .the Soviet Union to photograph the missile test range at kapustin Yar. Bec~usc of ad­ vanced warning fro111 either radar or agents inside British inti:lli~ gence, the overflight did not catch the Soviet Union by surprise. Soviet fighters damaged and nearly shot down the Canberra." Rumors about this flight reached Washington during the summer of 1953, but official confinnation by the United Kingdom did not come until February· i954. While on a six-week tour of Europe to study aerial reconnaissance problems for the US Air Force's Scientific Advisory Board, James Baker was briefed by RAF intelligence offi­ cials on the Canbe1Ta overfiigllt of the Soviet Union. On 22 and 23 March 1954, he reported 011 it to the full Scientific Advisory Board at Langley AFB, Virginia. · "' Yan der A.in. Aerial Espio11u8e. p. 18; Philip G.

Even without Iylartin 1s specifications or drawings, Donovan· had been able to estimate what could be done to the B-57 by lengthening the wings and lightening the fuselage.

When he was finally able to nlake this trip in late sum1ner, Donovan foun_d the plane that he and the other ISP members had been seeking. On the afternoon of 2 August 1954, Donovan met with L. · Eugene Root, an old Air Force acquaintance who was now a Lockheed vice-president, and learned about the Air Force's competi­ tion for a high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft. Kelly Johnson then showed Donovan the plans for Lockheed's unsuccessful entry: A life­ long sailplane enthusiast, Donovan immediately recognized Uial the •!

Upon his return east on 8 August, Donovan got in touch with · James Baker and suggested an urgent. meeting of the Intelligence . Syste1ns Panel. Because of other con1mitn1ents by the members, how~ ever, the panel did nol meet to hear Donovan's report until 24 September 1954 at the Cornell Aero'nautical Laboratory. Several members, including Land and Strong, were absent. Those who did at­ tend Were upset to learn that the Air Force had funded a closed com­ petition for a tactical reconnaissance plane withool informing them. But once Donovan began describing Kelly Johnson's rojected design for a jet-powered glider, 'they quickly forgot their annoyance and lis­ tened intently. Donovan began by stressing that high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft had to fly above 70,000 feet to be safe from interception. Next, he set out what he considered to be the three essential re-. quirements for a high-altitude spyplane: a single engine, a sailplane wing, and low structural load factors. Donovan strongly favored single-engine aircraft because they are both lighter and more reli­ able than multiengine aircraft. Although a twin-engine aircraft could ' ' I' i i I ·" theoretically return to base on only one engine, Donovan explained, it could only do _so al a much lower altitude, about 34,000 feet, where it was sure to be shot down.· The second of Donovan's essential factors, a sailplane wing (in technical terms .a high-aspect-raHo, low-induced-drag wing),· was needed to lake maximum advantage of the reduced thrust of a jet en­ gine operating in the rarefied allnosphere .of extre1ne altitude. Because of the thinness of the atmosphere above 70,000 feet, engineers esti­ 1nated that the po\vcr curve of a jet engine would fa11 ·off to about 6 percent of its sea-level th111st. · · Finally, low structural load factors, like U1ose used by transport aircraft, were necessary to reduce weight and thereby achieve 1naxi­ mum altitude. Donovan cxplai!1ed that strengthening wings and " Donovan interview J)1 Seer et SeGRET' C01462740 SE:GRET See1 et NOFORN Chapter 1 26 _ wingroot areas to withstand the high speeds and sharp turns man­ dated by the standard military airworthiness rules added too much weight to the airframe, thereby negating the ·efficiency of the sail­ plane wing. In short, it was possible to achieve altitudes in excess of 70, 000 feet, but only by making certain that all parts of the aeronautical equation were in balance: thrust, lift, and weight. The only plane meeting these requirements, Donovan insisted, was Kelly Johnson's CL-282 because it was essentially a sailplane. In Donovan's .view, the CL-282 did not have to meet the specifications of a combat aircraft because it could fly safely above Soviet fighters." Donovan'.s arguments convinced Lhe Intelligence Systems Panel of the ·merits of the CL-282 proposal, but this panel reported to the Air Force, which had already rejected the CL-282. Thus, even though the Lockheed CL-282 had several important sources of support by September 1954---the members of the Intelligence Systems Panel and high-ranking Air Force civilians such as Trevor Gardner-these back­ ers were oil! connected with .the Air Force. They could not offer funds to Lockheed to pursue the CL-282 concept because the Air Force was already committed to the Martin RB-57 and the Bell X-16. Additional support from outside the Air Force was needed lo bring the Cl~282 project to life, and this support would come from scientists serving on high-level advisory committees.· · The Technological Capabilities Panel The Eisenhower administration was growing increasingly concerned over the capability of the Soviet Union to launch a surprise attack on the United States. Early in J954, Trevor Gardner had beco1ne alarmed by a RAND Corporation sn1dy warning that a Soviet surprise attack might destroy 85 percent of the SAC.bomber force. Gardner then met with Dr. Lee DuBridge, President of the California Institute of Technology and Chairman of the Office.of Defense Mobilization's Science Advisory Committee, and crilicized the committee for not dealing with such essential problems as the possibility of.a surprise attack. This criticism led DuBri<lge to invite Gardner to speak at the Science Advisory Committee's next meeting. After listening to [ I I · I ' I ! !

Stressing the high priority he gave to reducing the risk of mili­ tary surprise, the President asked the committee to advise him on this problem." The President's request led Chairman DuBridge to ask one of the most prominent members, MIT President James R. Killian, Jr., to meet with other Science Advisory Committee members in the Boston area to discuss the feasibility of a comprehensive scientific assess­ ment of the nation's .defenses. At their meeting at MlT on 15 April 1954, the group called for the recruitment of such a task force if the President endorsed the concept. On 26 July 1954: President Eisenhower authorized Killian· to re­ cruit and lead a panel of experts to study "the country's technologi­ cal capabilities to meet some of its current problems." Killian quickly set up shop in offices located in the Old Executive Office Building and organized 42 of the nation's leading scientists into three special project groups investigating US offensive, defensive, and intelligence capabilites, with an additional communications working group (see chart, page 28). The Technological· Capabilities Panel (TCP) groups began meeti"ng on 13 September 1954. For the . next 20 weeks, the members of tl1e various panels met on 307 sepa­ rate occasions for briefings, field trips, conforcnces, and meetings with every major unit of the US defense.and intelligence establish­ ments. After receiving the ·most up-to-date information available on the nation's defense and intelligence programs, the. panel members began drafting their report to the National Security Council."

(Din) Land, the inventor of the polarizing fil­ ter and the instant camera. When James Killian asked Land to ·head· Project Three, Land. had to make a major decision about. his career. At the liinc, the 45-year-old inillionaire was on a leave of absen_ce fro1n "Polaroid and was living in Hollywood, advising Alfred Hitchcock on the technolilgical aspects of making three-dimensional movies. Land decided to give up his interest in cinen1a's th~rd ditnension and ferurn east to Polaroid and the panel appointinent. 47 Land's Project Three was the smallest of the three Technological Capabilities Panel projects, for he preferred what he called "taxicab commiuees" -committees small enough to fit into a single taxicab. The Project Three coinmiuee consisted of Land; James !laker and Edward Purcell of Harvard; chemist Joseph W. Kennedy of Washington University, St. Louis; mathematician John W. Tukey of Princeton University and Bell Telephone Laboratories; and Allen Latham, Jr., of Arthur D. Little, Inc., an engineer and former treasurer of the Polaroid Corporation." · In mid-August 1954, Land and Baker went to Washington to ar­ rauge for the various intelligence organizations to brief the Project. Three study group. As the briefings progressed, the panel members became 1nore and more distressed <1.t the poor state of the nation's in­ telligence res0tirccs. Land later noted, "We would go in and interview generals and admirals in charge of intelligence and come away wor~ ried. Here we ·were, five or six young men, asking questions that these high-ranking officers couldn't answer."· Land added that the Project Three me1nbers were also not overly in1pressed with the Central Intelligence Agency.". Land learned the details of Lockheed's proposed CL-282 aircraft soon after he arrived in Wasl1ington.

As soon as Land saw Strong's copy of the CL-282 drawing, howev<;r. he telephoned Baker to say, "Jim, I think I have the plane you are after." .~o A few days later, when Land showed Kelly Johnson's conceptual drawing to Baker and the other Project Three members, they all be­ came enthusiastic about the aircraft's possibilities. Although !laker had heard Allen Donovan's brief mention of the Lockheed design in May, he had not yet seen a drawing of the aircraft because Donovan did not report to the ISP on his ear-ly-August trip to Lockheed until 24 September. After seeing the CL-282 drawing,_ Baker began designing a camera and lens system that would fit in the Lockheed craft." At the end of August, Land discussed the CL-282 with Allen Dulles's Special Assistant for Planning and Coordination, Richard Bissell, who came away from the meeting without any definite ideas as to what Land wanted to do with the aircraft. Overhead reconnais­ sance was not uppennost in Bisscll's mind· at the tin1e, and it was un~ clear to him why he had even been contacted." Bissell's outstanding academic credentials, his acquaintanceship with James Killian through his previous teaching experience at MIT, and his direct access to DC! Dulles may have led the Technological Capabilities Panel members to consider him the liest CIA point of contact Although surprised that he had become involved in the CL-282 project, Bissell's interest was piqued, and he set out to learn "!hat he could about reconnaissance ·systems. In early September 1954, Bissell had Douglas E. Ashford, a young Air Force officer on· his . staff, put together a general slatus report on air reconnais~ance pro~ grams. Bissell forwarded the 16-page study to the Deputy Director of Central ·Intelligence (DDCI), LL. Gen. Charles PeruTe Cabell, USAF, on 24 September.

By September 1954, Land's Project Three study group had be­ come very much interested in the Lockheed CL-282 design. Their in­ terest grew· even stronger when James Baker told them of Allen Donovan's strong case for the CL-282 at the 24-25 September meeting of the ISP. It is not possible to dctcnmine exactly when the Land com­ . mittee decided to back the CL-282; in fact, there may never have been a formal decision as such. In v·iew of Land's in1pulsivc nature, he probably seized upon the CL-282 design as being a workable concept and immediately_ began developing it into a con1plcte rec~nnaissance system. During September and October tl1e Project Three study group met frequently to discuss the Lockheed design and the reconnaissance equipment it would carry. Meetings were small, generally with fewer than 10 participants; Garrison No1ton was often the only government official in attendance. At times outside experts joined in the proceed­ ings. When the discassion turned to cameras and film, Land invited Dr. Henry Yutzy, Eastman Kodak's film expert, and Richard S. Perkin, President of the Perkin-Elmer Company, to participate. For discussions on the 157 engine, the panel members asked Perry W. Pratt, Pratt and Whitney's chief engineer, to attend. Kelly Johnson also met with the panel to review plans for the CL-282 system." By the end of October, the Project Three meetings had covered every aspect. of the Lockheed design. The. CL-282 was to be more lhan an airplane· with a camera, it was to be an integrated intelli­ gence-collection system that the Project Three members were confi­ dent could find and photograph the Soviet Union's Bison bomber fleet and, thus, resolve the growing "bomber gap" controversy. It '>'(as not just the Lockheed aircraft that had captured the Land group's fan­ cy; the plane was seen as the platform for a \Vhole new generati9n of aerial cameras that several co111mittee men1bers had been discussing since the BEACON HILL and Intelligence Systems Panel meet!ngs.

The one remaining question was who would conduct the overflights. The committee's members, particularly Land, were not in favor of the Air Force conducting such 1nissi.ons in peacetilne. Firmly believing that military overflights in armed aircraft could pro­ voke a war, they argued for civilian overflights in unarmed, unmarked aircraft. In their view, the organization most suited for this n1ission was the Central Intelligence Agency." Jn late October 1954, the Project_ Three panel discussed the CL-282 system concept with DC! Allen Dulles and the Secretary of the Air Force's Special Assistant for Research and Development, Trevor Gardner. Dulles was reluctant to have the CIA undertake the project. He did not like to involve the CIA with military projects, even ones that the military had rejected, like the CL-282. Furthermore, the DC! strongly believed that the Agency's mission.lay in the use of hu­ man operatives and set:ret com111unications 1 the classic fo1ms of intel­ ligence gathering. Land came away from this meeting with the impression thal Dulles somehow thought overflights were not fair play. Project Three con1n1ittee men1bers were·nevertheless convinced that technology, particularly in the form of the CL-282 and the new camera designs, would solve the nation's incclligcn.ce problems." A Meeting ~!th the President Allen Dulles's reluctance to involve the CIA in the CL-282 project did not stop the Project Three committee from pursuing its aims because it was able to go over Dulles's head and appeal directly to the President. Having participated in the BEACON HILL Study and the Intelligence Syste1ns Panel, several Project Three i11en1bers had definite ideas on hO\v· to iinprove intelligence collection, ideas that they were deter­ mined to present lo the highest levels of government.

The committee thus had a direct line to the White House through James Killian's contacts there. Early in November 1954, Land and Killian met with President ,Eisenhower to discuss high-altitude reconnaissaoce. Killian's mem­ oirs contain an account of this crucial meeting: Land described the [CL-282] system using an unarmed plane and reco11Unended that its developmenl be undertaken. After listening to our proposal and asking many hard questions, Eisenhower ap­ proved the development of the system, but he stipulated that it should be handled in an unconvenJional way so that it ~vould not become entangled in the bureaucracy of the Defense Departmeni or troubled by rivalries among the .services.j11 The scientists from the advisory committees and the President \Vere thus in agreement that the new reconnaissance program should be controlled by the CIA, not the military. CIA and Air Force Agreement on the CL-282 Meanwhile Edwin Laod and his Project Three colleagues were work­ ing to convince Allen Dulles that the. CIA should run the proposed overflight prognun. On 5 November Land wrote to the DCI strongly urging that the CIA undertake the CL-282 project: Here is the brief reporz from our panel telling why we think overflight is urgent and presently feasible. I [Land] am not sure zhat we have made it clear that ive feel there are many reasons why this activity is appropriate for CIA, always with Air Force assistance.

The committee members also listed the advantages of using the CL-282 rather than an Air Force aircraft: . The Lockheed super glider will.fly at 70,000 feet, well out of the reach ofpresent Russian interceptors and high enough to have a good chance of avoiding detection. The p(ane itself is so light (15,000 pounds), so obviously unarmed· and devoid of military U!J'efulness, that it would 1ninimize affront to the Russians even if through some re1note mischance it were detected and identi­ fied." · One ·additional advantage of the Lockheed.design over the Air Force's proposed high-altilude··reconnaissance aircraft was a faster completion time. Kelly Johnson had promised the Land committee that his aircraft would be flying by August 1955, just eight months after he proposed to start construction.The Bell X-16 prototype was not scheduled for completion before the. spring·of 1956.

Some Air Force officials, however, feared that a decision Lo build the CL-282 might jeopardize the Air Force's own RB-57 and X-16 projects. Just" one month earlier, in October 1954, the Wright Air Development Command bad appealed to the Air Force Deputy Chief of Staff for Development, Lt. Gen. Donald L. Putt, to oppose tl1e adoption of the Lockheed design. The officials ar­ gued that the Bell X-16 was a better design because it was more air­ worthy than the CL-282 ai1d could be used throughout the Air Force in different types of missions because it had two engines, wheels, and an armor-plated, pressurized pilot's compartment. If 157 engines were diverted to the CL-282, the appeal to General Putt warned, there would not be enough of tl1ese popular powerplants to meet the needs of the X-16 progrnm." Having heard of the Wright Air Development Command attack on lhc CL-282, Allen Donovan of the Intelligence Systems Panel met with General Putt on 19 October to. argue in favor of the Lockheed design: This discussion led General Putt to meet with 15 scientists from the Technological Capabilities Panel on 18 November 1954 to discuss the merits of the four proposed reconnaissance aircraft. Also present as a briefer was Maj. John Seaberg from the Wright Air. Development Command, who later recalled: What I did was presenl the results ofmy comparative analysis of all four designs. T showed the relative high altilude·performance capabilities of alt Joun I pointed out that aerodynamically the Bell, Fairchild, and Lockheed designs were close.

Andfurlher, I overlaid a curve showing that with the 157 [Pratt & Whitney en­ gine] installed, it would then be competitive wilh the Bell and Fairchild designs." This meeting-along with the knowledge . that President Eisenhower also supported the CL-282-helped win over the Air Force. To be on Lhe safe side, however, the Air Force clitl not abandon the X-16 program until the Lockheed aircraft had begun flying. 1 ~ Donovan int~rview>8"· ~ 1 Quoted in Miller, Lockheed lJ-2, p. l3.

The participants-Dulles and Cabell from the CIA; Gardner, Ayer, and General ·rutt from the Air Force; Kelly Johnson; and Edwin Land"-all agreed "that the special item of material described by Lockheed was· practical and desirable and would be sought. ... It was agreed that the Project should be a joint Air Force-CIA one but that, regardless of the source of the funds, whether AF or CIA, CIA unvouchered channels would be needed to pass the funds. " 64 It is interesting to note that Lockheed, which had originally de­ veloped the CL-282 on its own and had devoted considerable effort to promoting it, had to be persuaded to undertake the project in Noveinbcr I 954 because the company had become heavily committed to several otl1er civilian and military projects. When Kelly Johnson received a call from Trevor Gardner on 17 November asking him to come to Washington for conversations on the project, his Instructions from Lockheed'.s senior management were "to not commit 10 any program during ·1he visit, but to get the information and return." Whim ·he returned to California, Johnson noted in his project fog that. "! was .impressed with the secrecy aspect and was told by Gardner that I was essentially being drafted for the project. It seemed, in fact, that if I did not talk quietly,· I might ·have to talce a leave of absence from my job at Lockheed to do this special project."" Of course, Kelly Johnson did not need to be drafted or persuaded into undertak­ ing such a bold step forward in aircraft design. He used Gardner's · i I l statement 10 convince'Lockheed's senior management to approve the project, which they did afier meeting with Johnson when he returned to California on the evening of 19 November . . Four days later, on 23 November, the Intelligence Advisory Committee (!AC) approved DC! Dulles's request to undertake the CL-282 project. The following day Dulles signed a three-page mem­ orandum, drafted by DDCI Cabell, asking President Eisenhower to approve the overhead reconnaissance project.

Saying it was too secret for him to explain, Dulles gave Bissell apacket of documents and told him he could keep it for several days to acquaint himself with the project. Bissell had long known of the proposal to build a high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft, but only in the most general terms. Now he learned in detail about the project that proposed send­ ing aircraft over'the Soviet Union. Late on the morning of 2 December 1954, Dulles told Bissell to go to the Pentagon on the following day .to represent the Agency at an organizational meeting for the U-2' project. Before leaving, Bissell asked Dulles which agency was to run the project. The DC! repli<~d that nothing had been ·clearly decided. Bissell then asked who was going to pay for the pr9ject. Dulles answered: "That wasn't even mentioned. You'll have to work that out." 1 Bissell was accompanied by Herbert I.

The participants spent very lit­ tle time delinea.ting Air Force and Agency responsibilities in the pro­ ject, laking for granted that the CIA would handle the security matters. Much of the discussion centered on methods for diverting Air Force materiel to the program, particularly the Pratt & Whitney J57 engines, because a separate contract for the engines might jeop­ ardize the project's security. The Air Force pro'nlised to turn ovei- a number of J57 engines, which were then being produced for B-52s, KC-l35s, P-IOOs, and RB-57s. Eventually Bissell asked who was going to pay for the airframes to be built by Lockheed. His query was greeted with silence. Everyone present had their eyes on h_im because they all expected the Agency to come up with the funds; Bissell rose .from his chair, said he would see what he could do, and the meeting adjourned.' · After the meeting, Bissell told Dulles that the CIA would have to use money from the. Contingency Reserve Fund to get the project going. The DC! used this fund to pay for cove1t activities, following approval by the President and the Director of the Budget. Dulles told Bissell to draft a memorandum for the President on funding the over­ flight program and to start putting together a staff for Project AQUATONE, the project's new codename. At first the new "Project Stuff" (renamed· tl1e Development Projects Staff in April 1958)- consisted of Bissell, Miller, and the small existing staff·in Bissell's Office of the Special Assistant to the DC!.

Kelly Johnson's willingness to begin work on the aircraft with­ out a contract illustrates one of the most important aspects of this pi"o­ gram: the use of unvouchered funds for covert procurement.

Public Law 110, approved by the 8lst Congress on 20 June 1949, designates the Director of Central Intelligence as the only government employee who can obligate Federal money Without the use of vouch­ ers. By using unvouchered funds, it is possible to eliminate competi­ tive bidding and thereby limit the number of parties who know about a given project. The use of unvouchered funds also speeds up the Federal procurement cycle. A general contractor such as Lockheed can purchase much, if not all, of the supplies needed for a project without resorting at each step to the mandated rocurement proce­ dures involving public, competitive bidding. In mid-December 1954, President Eisenhower authorized DC! Dulles to use $35 million from the Agency's Contingency Reserve Fund lo finance the U-2 project. Then on 22 December 1954, the Agency signed -a 'letter contract with Lockheed, using the codename Project GARFISH. The Agency had proposed to give Lockheed "performance specifications" rather than the standard Air Force "technical specifica­ tions," which were more 1igid and demanding, and Kelly Johnson agreed that such a move would save a lot of money. Lockheed's original pro­ posal to the Air Force in May 1954 had been $28 ntillion for 20 U-2s equipped with GE 173 engines. During negotiations with CIA General Counsel Lawrence R. Houston, Lockheed changed its proposal to $26 million for 20 airframes plus a two-seat trainer model and spares; the Air !'orce was to furnish the engines. Houston insisted that the Agency could only budget $22.5 million for the airframes because it needed the balance of the available $35 million for cameras and life-support gear. The two sides finally agreed on a fixed-price contract witl1 a provision for a re­ view three-fourths of the way through to detennine if the costs were going to exceed the $22.5 million' figure. The formal contract, No. SP-1913, was signed on 2 March 1955 and called for the delivery of the first U-2 in July 1955 and the last in November 1956. Meanwhile, to keep work moving at Lockheed, Richard Bissell wrote a check for $1256,000 1~2-5-X-1,-E-.0-.-1-3-52-6~1 and mailed it to Kelly Johnson's home on 21 February 1955.' --------··--·----·--"··-­ 9 John S. \Varner, Office of lhe General Coun~el, interview by Donald E.

Lockheed delivered the aircraft not only on time but under budget. During the final contract negotiations in the spring of 1958, Lockheed and the US Government agreed on a price for the original 20 aircraft of $17,025,542 plus a profit of $1,952,055 for a total of $18,977,597-less than $1 million for each aircraft. Because its design was based on Lockheed's F-104, the U-2 was relatively in­ expensive even though only a small number of aircraft had been or­ dered. Only the wings and tail were unique; Lockheed manufactured the other portions of the aircraft using the F-104 's jigs and dies. MAJOR DESIGN FEATURES OF THE U-2 Aware -of the great need for secrecy in the new projec~ Kelly Johnson placed it in Lockheed's Advanced Development facility at Burban\(, California, known as the Skunk Works. ' 0 Lockheed had established this highly secure area in 1.945 to develop the nation's first jet aircraft, the P-80 Shooting Star. The small Skunk Works staff began making the detailed drawings for the U-2, which was nicknamed the "Angel" because it was to fly so high. Kelly Johnson's approach to prototype development was to have his engineers and draftsmen located not more than 50 feet from the aircraft assembly line. Difficulties in construction were immediately brough.t to theauention of the engineers, who gathered the mechanics around the drafting tables to discuss ways to overcome the difficul­ ties. As a result, engineers we'e generally able to fix problems in the design in a matter of hours, not days or weeks. There was no e1npha­ sis placed on producing neatly typed memorandums; engineers sim­ ply made pencil notations on the engineering drawings in order to keep the project n1oving quickly. 11 A little more than a week after he had been authorized to begin the project, Kelly Johnson wrote a 23-page report detailing his most recent ideas on the U-2 proposal. The aircraft, he explained, would be designed to meet load factors of only 2.5 g's, which was the limit for transport aircraft rather than combat planes.

SECRET C01462740 SECRET SeeFOt NOFORN Chapter 2 47 In designing the U-2 aircraft, Kelly Johnson was confronted with two major problems-fu"el capacity and weight. To achieve interconti­ nental range.,the aircraft had to ca1Ty a large supply of fuel, yet, it also had to be light enough to attain the ultrahigh altitudes needed to be safe frcim interception. Although the final product resembled a.typ­ ical jet aircraf~ its construction was unlike any other US military air-· craft. One unusual design feature was the tail assembly, which-to save weig~t-w.as attached to the main body with just three tension bolts. This feature had been adapted from sailplane designs. The wings were also unique. Unlike conventiorial aircraft, whose main wing spar passes through the fuselage to give the wings continu­ ity and strength, the U-2 had two separate wing panels, which were attached to the fuselage sides with tension bolts (again, just as in sail­ planes). Because the wing spar did not pass through the fuselage, Johnson was able to locate the camera behind the pilot and ahead df the engine, thereby improving the aircraft's center of gravity and re­ ducing it• weight. The wings were the most challenging design feature of the entire airplane. Their combination of high-aspect ratio and low-drag ratio (in other words, the wings were long, narrow, and thin) made them unique in jet aircraft design. The wings were actually integral fuel tanks that carried almost all of the U-2's fuel supply. · The fragility of the wings and tail section, which were only bolted to the fuselage, forced Kelly Johnson to look for a way to pro­ tect the aircraft from gusts of wind at altitudes below 35,000 feet, which otherwise might cause lhe aircraft to disintegrate. Johnson again borrowed from sailplane designs to devise a "gnst conn·o!" mechanism that set the ailerons and hodzontal stabilizers into a posi­ tion that kept the aircraft in a sfightly nose-up attitude, thereby avoiding sudden stresses caused by w}nd gusts. Nevertheless, the U-2 ren1ained a very fragile aircraft that required great skill and concen­ tration from Jes pilots. ' The final major design feature was the lightweight, bicycle-type landing gear. The entire structure-a single oleostrut with two light­ weight wheels toward the front of the aircraft and two small, solid-mount wheels under the tail__:._weighed only 208 pounds yet could withstand the force of touchdown for this 7-ton aircraft. Because both sets of wheels were located underneath the fuselage, the U-2 was also equipped with detachable pogos (long, curved sticks with two small wheels on them) on each wing to keep the wings level during takeoff. The pilot would d(9p the pogos immediately after takeot'f'so ! ! .

Existing cameras were too bulky and lacked sufficient resolution to be used in high-altitude reconnaissance. The workhorses of World War H aerial photography had been the Fairchild K-19 and K-21 framing cameras with lenses of varying focal lengths from 24 to 40 inches. Late in the war, the .trimetrogon K-17 mapping-camera system came into use. This system consisted of three separate cameras which made three photographs simultaneously: a vertical, an oblique to the left, and an oblique to the right. The major shortcomings of the trimetrogon system were the large amoun.t of film required and the system's lack of sharp definition on the obliques. The stan<lard aerial cameras available in the early 1950s could achieve resolutions of about 20 to 25 feet (7 to 8 meters) on a side when used at an.altitude of 33,000 feet.(10,000 meters), or about 25 lines per millimeter in current terms of reference. Such resolution was considered adequate because aerial photography was then used pri­ marily to choose targets for strategic bombing, to assess bomb dam­ age after air raids, and to make ·maps and charts. Unfortunately, a camera witl1 a resolution of only 20 to 25 feet at a height of 33,000 feet was too crude IP be used at twice that altitude. Indeed, for intelli­ gence purposes a resolution of less than 1 O feet was necessary to dis­ cern smaller targets in greater detail. This meant that any camera carried to altitudes above 68, 000 feet had to be almost four times as good as existing aerial cameras in order tc:> achieve a resolution of less than' JO feet. As a result, some scientists doubted that useful photogra­ phy could be obtained from altitudes higher than 40,000 feet." 1 ~ lial<er interview ~- SE(JRET U-2 landing gear and poflos C01462740 SECRET Sec1 et NOFORN Chapter 2 50 Photo of James G. Baker James G. Baker The first success in designing very-high-acuity lenses came in the mid-1940s, when James G. Baker of Harvard and Richard S. Perkin of the Perkin-Elmer (P-E) .Company of Norwalk, Connecticut, collaborated on a design for an experimental camera for tl1e Army Air Force. They developed a 48-inch focal-length scanning camera that was mounted in a modified B-36 bomber. When tested over Fort Worth, Texas, at 34,000 feet, the new camera produced photographs· in which two golf balls on a putting green could be distinguished (in reality, however, the "golf balls" were 3 inches in di~meter). These photographs demonstrated the high acuity of Baker's lens, but the ca111era weighed more than a ton and was much too large to be carried aloft in· an aircraft as small as the U-2. Realizing that size and weigl:tt were the major restraining factors in developing a camera for the U-2; James Baker began working on a ra~ically new system in October 1954, even before the CIA adopted the Lockheed proposal. Baker quickly recognized, however, that he would need almost a year to produce a working model of such a com­ plex camera. Since Kelly Johnson had promised to have a U-2 in the air within eight months, Baker needed to find an existing camera that could be used until the new camera was ready. After consulting with his friend and colleague Richard Perkin, Baker decided to adapt for the U-2 an Air Force camera known as the K-38, a 24-inch aerial framing camera built by the Hycon Manufacturing Company of Pasadena, California. Perkin suggested modifying several standard K-38 cameras in order to reduce their weight to the U-2's 450-pound payload limit. At the same time, Baker would make critical adjustments to existing K-38 lenses to improve their acuity. Baker was able to do this in a few weeks, so several modified K-38s, now known as A-1 cameras, were ready when the first "Angel" aircraft took tO the ait· in mid-1955." / CIA awarded Hycon a contract for the modified K-38 cameras, and Hycon, in tum, subcontracted to Perkin-Elmer to provide new lenses and to make other modifications to the cameras in order to make them less bulky. In its turn, Perkin-Elmer subcontracted to Baker to rework the existing K-38 lenses and later design an im­ proved lens system.

The A-1 camera system consisted of two 24-fiich K-38 frruning cameras. One was mounted vertically and photographed a 17.2' swath beneath the aircraft onto a roll of 9.5-inch film. The second K-38 was placed in a rocking mount so that it alternately photographed the Jeff oblique and right oblique out to 36.5' onto separate rolls of 9.5-inch film. The film supplies unwound in opposite directions in order to 1ninhnize their effect on the balance of the aircraft. Both cameras used standard Air Force 24-inch focal-length lenses adjusted for max­ imum acuity by Baker. The development of the special rocking mount by Perkin-Elmer's Dr. 'Roderic M. Scott was a major factor in reduc­ ing the size and weight of the A-l system, because ·the mount pro­ vided broad transverse coverage with a single lens, ending the need for two separate cameras."

The A-2 consisted of three separate K-38 framing cameras and 9.5-inch film magazines. One K-38 filmed the right oblique, another the vertical, and a third the left oblique. The A-2 system also included a 3-inch tracking camera. All A-2 cameras were equipped with the new 24-inch f/8.0 Baker-designed lenses. These were the first relatively large photo­ graphic objective lenses to employ several aspheric surfaces. James c '. I I I j i i , I :: Secaet : I Baker personally ground these su1faces and made the final bench tests on each lens before releasing it to the Agency. These lenses were able to resolve 60 lines per millimeter, a 240-percent improvement over existing lenses. 11 Once Baker and Scott had redesigned the 24-inch lens for the K-38 devi"'s, they turned their attention to Baker's new camera de­ sign,°known as the B model. !t was a totally new concept, a high-reso­ . lution panoramic-type framing camera with a niuch longer 36-inch f/10.0 aspheric lens. The B camera was a very complex device that used a single lens to obtain photography from one horizon to the other, thereby reducing weight by having two fewer lenses and shutter assemblies than the standard trimetrogon configu·ration. Because its lens was longer than those used in tl1e A cameras, the B camera ac.hieved even higher resolution-IOO lines per millimeter., The B camera used an 18- by 18-inch format, which was achieved by focusing the image onto two counterrotating but overlap­ ping 9. 5-inch wide strips of film. Baker designed this camera so that one film· supply was located forward, tlie other aft. Thus, as the film supplies unwound, tl1ey counterbalanced each other and did not dis­ ti1rb the aircraft's center of gravity. The B camera had two modes of operation. In mode J; the camera used a sitigle lens to make seven unique exposures from 73.5'. on the far right and far left obliques to vertical photos beneath the air­ craft, effectively covering from h01izon to horizon. Mode II narrowed the lateral coverage to 21 S on either side of vertical. This increased · the available. number of exposures and almost doubled the camera's '" "Busic ConfigLJration and C:amcra Data," 24 January· 1956, OSA Records (TS Codeword}; OSA Hi.story, chap.

' : I SE:GRET I C01462740 SECRET -secret-NOFORN Chapter 2 55 Realizing that the 240-inch lens was both Loo large and too heavy for the camera bay, Baker scaled Lhe lens down to a 200-inch f/16. 0 system. This was still too big. Further reductions followed, re­ sulting by July 1955 in a 120-inch f/10.9 lcns.that met boU1.the weight and space limitations. Later in the year, Baker decided to make the mirrors for the system out of a new, lightweight foamed silica mate­ rial developed by Pittsburgh-Corning Glass Company. This reduced the weight significantly, and he was able to scale up the Jens Lo a 180-inch (Y.13.85 reflective system for a 13- by 13-inch format. In the past, the calculations for such a complex camera lens would have· taken years to complete, but thanks to Baker's ray-tracing computer program, he was able to accomplish the task in just 16 days. When a C camera built by Hycon was night:tested on 31 January 1957, project engineers discovered that its 180-inch focal length, which was five times longer tl10n that of the 'B 9amera, made the camera very sensitive to aircraft vibration and Jed to great difficulty in aiming the C camera from altitudes above 68,000 feet. The engi­ neers, therefore, decided to shelve the camera. More than five years later,· a redesigned C camera was employed during the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962, but the results were not very satisfactory. The failure of the C camera design was pot a selious setback to the high-altitude reconnaissance progr3.1n, because the B camera proved highly successful. Once initial difficulties with the film-trans­ port system were overcome, the B camera became the workhorse ·of high-altitude photography. An improved version known as the B-2 is still in use. Both of the earlier A-model cameras were phased out after Septmnber 1958. During the period when he was designing lenses for the C!Ns overhead reconnaissance program, James Baker was also working on classified lens designs for the Air Force and unclassified designs for the S1nithsonian Institution. To protect the security of Baker's work for .the Agency, Herbert Miller of the Development Projects Staff told Baker to work on lenses for the U-2 in the open and not make any effort to classify the documents connected with the project. Miller be­ lieved that by not calling attention to the effort through the use of spe­ cial security measures, the project could be completed faster and still not be compromised; This "hid.ing in the open" strategy proved very successful. 21 • 11 Ibid.

Designed by James Baker and built by Walter Baird of Baird Associates, the optical peri­ scope helped pilots recognize targets beneath the aircraft and also proved to be a valuable navigational aid.n PREPARATIONS FOR TESTING THE U-2 Sea1et­ As work progressed in California on the airframe, in Connecticut on the engines, and in Boston on the camera system, the lop officials of the Development Projects Staff flew to California and Nevada to search for a site where the aircraft could be tested safely and secretly. On 12 April 1955 Richard Bissell and Col. Osr.nund Ritland (ihe se­ nior Air Force officer on the project staff) flew over Nevada with Kelly Johnson in a small Beechcraft plane piloted by Lockheed's chief test pilot, Tuny Le Vier. They spatted what appeared to be an air­ strip by a salt flat known as Groom Lake, near the northeast corner of the Atomic Energy Commission's '(AEC) Nevada Proving Ground. After, debating about landing on tl1c old airslrip, Le Vier set the plane down on the lakebed, and.all four walked over to· examine the strip. The facility had been used during World War II as an aerial gunnery range for Army Air Corps pilots. From the air the strip appeared to be paved, but on closer inspection it turned out to have originally been fashioned from compacted earth that had turned iiito ankle-deep dust after more than a decade of disuse. IfLeVier had attempted to land on the airstrip, the plane would probably have nosed. over when the wheels sank into the loose soil, killing or injuring all of the key fig­ ures in the U-2 project." , Bissell and his colleagues all agreed that Groom Lake would make an ideal site for testing the U-2 and !raining its pilots. Upon re­ turning to Washington, Bissell discovered tliat Groom Lake was not · part of the ABC proving ground. After consulting with Dulles, Bissell and Miller asked the Atomip Energy Commission ·to add the Groom· Lake area to its real estate holdings in Nevada. AEC Chairman Adm. Lewis Strauss readily agreed, and President Eisenhower also ap­ proved the addition of this strip of wasteland, known by it< map des­ ignation as Area 51, to the Nevada Test Site.

Chapter 2 59 SECURITY FOR THE U-2 PROJECT ·1 On 29 April 1955, Richard Bissell signed an agreement with the Air Force and the Navy (which al lhat time was also interested in the ·u-2) in which the services agreed that the CIA "assumed primary respon­ sibility for all security" for the overhead re.connaissance project (AQUATONE). From this time on, the CIA has heen (esponsible for the security of overhead programs. Thi~ responsibility has placed a heavy burden on the Office of Secmity for establishing procedures to keep large numbers of contracts untraceable to the Central Intelligence Agency. The Office of Security has also had to detennine which contractor employees require security clearances and has had to devise physical security measures for the vatjous manufacturing fa­ cilities. Keeping tl1e U-2 and subsequent overhead systems secret has been a time-consuming and costly undertaking.25 The. most important aspect of the security program for tho U-2 ·project was the creation of an entire pew companmented systc1n for the product of U-2 missions. Access lo the photographs taken by the U-2 would be strictly controlled, which often limited the ability of CIA analysts to use the products of U-2 missions.. · The terminology used to describe U-2 aircraft and pilots also played a part in maii1taining the security of the overhead reconnais­ sance progra111. To reduce the chances of a security breach, tlie Agency always referred to its high-altitude aircraft as "articles," with each aircraft having its own "article number." Similarly, the pilots were always called "drivers." In cable traffic the aircraft were known as KWEXTRA-00 (the two-digit number identified the precise air­ craft; tl\ese numbers were not related to the three-digit article num­ bers assigned by the factory). The pilots' were referred to as KWGLITrER-00 (the two-digit number identified the precise pilot). Thus, eVen if a message or docu1nent about overflight activities fell into unfriendly hands, the contents would simply refer to codcw9rds or at worsL to "articlcsH. and "drivers," giving no indication of the nature of the prograin. 26 Even the aircraft's onboard equipment required the involvement of CIA security planners. Thus, when Kelly Johnson ordered altime­ ters from the Kollman Instrument Company, he specified that the ,..

This immediately raised eyebrows at Kollman because its instruments only went to 45..000 feet. Agency security personnel quickly briefed several Kollman.offi­ cials and produced a cover story that the altimeters were tq be used on experimental rocket planes." THE CIA- AIR FORCE PARTNERSHIP At the initial interagency meetings to establish the· U-2 program in December 1954, the paiticipanls did not work out a clear delineation .of responsibilities between the CIA and the Air Force. They agreed only that the Air Force would supply the engines and the Agency would pay for ti1e airframes and cameras. With a !IlYriad of details still unsettled, CIA and Air Force representatives began to work on an interagency agreement that would assign specific responsibilities for the program. These negotiations proved difficult. Discussions on this subject between DC! Allen Dulles and Air Force Chief of Staff Nathan Twining began in March 1955. Twining wanted SAC, headed by Gen. Curtis E. LeMay, to nm the project once the planes and. pilots were ready to fly, but Dulles opposed such an arrangement. The CIA-USAF talks dragged on for several months, with Twining determined that SAC should have full control once the aircraft was deployed. Eventually President Eisenhower settled the dispute. "! want this . whole thing to be a civilian operation," the President wrote. "If uni­ formed personnel. of the armed services of the United States fly over Russia, it is an act of w.;.-legally-and I don't wa~t any. pait of it." " With the issue of control over the program settled, the two agen­ cies soon worked out the remaining details. On 3 August 1955, Dulles and Twining met at SAC headquarters in Omaha to sign the basic agreement, titled "Organization and Delineation of Responsibilities­ Project OILSTONE" (OILSTONE was the Air Force codename for the project). This pact gave the Air Force responsibility for pilot selection and training, weather inforination, mission plotting, and operational support. The Agency was responsible for cameras, security, contract­ ing, film processing, anO arrangements for foreign bases, and it afso had a voice in the selection of pilots. All aeronautical aspects of the 27 Ibid. i• OSI\ /iistory, chap. 3, pp. 8-15 ¢codeword); B~schloss, May¢.ay, pp. 105-107. ·SsGRET 11 ' 1· ' I · [ I. li !~ '' '' I! 'I 1', I II . I 'II·I!

As a result of this agreement, CIA remained in control of the program, but t~e Air Force played a very importapl role as well. As Richard Bissell later remarked about the U-2 project, "The Air Force wasn'tjust in on this as a supporting element, and to a major degree it wasn't in on it just supplying about half. the government personnel; but the Air force held, if you want to be precise, 49 percent of the common stock. " 30 One of the fim Air Force oCiicers assigned to Project OfLSTONE was Col. Osmund I. Ritland. He. began coordinating Air Force activi­ ties in the U-2 program with Richard Bissell in December 1954. On 27 June 1955, Ritland became Bissell's deputy, although Air Force Chief of Staff Twining did not officially approve this assignment until 4 August, the day after the signing of the CIA-Air Force agreement. [n . March 1956, Colonel Ri.tland returned to tlte Air Force and was fol­ lowed as deputy project director by Col. Jack A. Gibbs. Osmund J. Ritland Another Air Force officer, Lt.. Col. Leo P. Geary, joined the pro­ gram in June 1955 and remained with it until August 1966, longer than any of the other project managers ..Using the Air Force [nspector General's office as cover with the Litle of Project Officer, AFCIG-5, Geary served as the focal point for all Defense Department support to the U-2 and OXCART programs. His 11 years with the overhead reconnaissance projects provided a high degree of Air Force continuity. 31 TECHNICAL CHALLENGES TO HIGH-ALTITUDE FLIGHT To get the U-2 aircraft ready to lly, Lockheed engineers had to solve problems never before encountered. Among these problems was the need for a fuel that would not boil off and ~vaporate at the very high altitudes for which the aircraft was designed. Gen. James .H.

The result was a dense mixture, known as LF-1 A, JP-TS (thermally stable), or JP-7, with a boiling point of 300'F at sea level. Manufacturing this special fuel required petroleum byproducts that Shell normally used to make its "Flit" fly and bug spray. In order to produce several hundred thousand gallons of LF-lA for the U-2 pro­ ject in. the spring and summer of 1955, Shell had lo limit the produc­ tion of Flit, causing a nationwide shortage. Because of the new fuel's density, it required special tanks and modifications to the aircraft's fuel-control and ignition systems." . J Even more important than the problem of boiling fuel was the problem of boiling blood, namely the pilot's. At altitudes above 65,000 feel, fluids in the human body will vaporize unless the body can be kept under pressure. Furthermore, the reduced atmospheric pressure placed considerable stress on the pilot's cardiovascular sys- · tern and did not provide adequate oxygenation of the blood. Keeping tl1e pilot alive at the extreme altitudes required for overflights there­ fore called for a totally different approach to environmental equlp­ ment; it required a system that could maintain pressure over much of the pilot's body. The technology that enabled U-2 pilots to operate for extended periods in. reduced atmospheric pressure would later play a major role in the manned space program. · Advising the Agency on· high-altitude survival were two highly experienced Air Force doctors, Col. Donald D. Flickinger and Col. W. Randolph Lovelace, II. Dr. Lovelace had begun his research on high-altitude flight before World War Il·and wus a coinventor of the standard Air Force oxygen mask. In 'the early 1950s, he and Flickinger made daring parachute jumps from B-47 bombers to test pilot-survival gear under extreme conditions. Flickinger served a~ the medical adviser lo Project AQUATONE for almost a decade." Flickinger and Lovelace suggested that the Agency ask the David Clark Company of Worcester, Massachusetts, manufacturer of environmental suits for Air Force pilots, to submit designs. for more Photo of Leo P.

The effort to provide a safe en­ vironment for pilots at high altitudes also inv.olved the Firewel Company of Buffalo, New York, which pressurized tl1e U-2 cockpit to create an interior environment equivalent to the air pressure al an alti­ Lude of 28,000 foet. The system was designed so that, if the interior cockpit pressure fell below the 28,000-feet level, the pilot's suit would automatically inflate. In either case, he could obtain oxygen only through his helmet." ~· Ibid.. chaµ. 5, p. 19 p5'Codeword). Secret ii 11 C01462740 SECRET Seeret NOFORN Chapter 2 64 The early models of these MC-2 and MC-3 partial-pressure suits were very uncomfortable for the pilots. To prevent Joss of pressure, the heavy coverall had to fit tightly· at the wrists and ankles (in the early models of these suits, the feet ;.,ere not included in the pressur­ iza\ion scheme). The pilot had to wear gloves and a heavy helmet that tended to chafe his neck and shoulders and was prone to fogging. Problems with the pilot life-support sy5teni were believed to have been the cause of several early crashes of the U-2. Having gotten a pilot into this bulky suit and shoehorned him into his seat in the cockpit, the next problem was how to get .hi'!! out in an emergency. The U-2 cockpit was very small, and the early mod­ els did not have an ejection seal. Even after an ejection seat was in­ stalled, pilots were reluctant to use it because they were afraid they would lose !heir legs below the knees when they were blown out of the cockpit. To save weight, the first pilot's seat was exrremely simple wilh no height adjustment mechanism. Designed· for pilots of above-average.height, the seat could be adjusted for shorter pilots by inserting wooden blocks beneath the seat to raise it. In later. versions of the aircraft, Kelly Johnson added a fully adjust;ible seat." The Air Force undertook bailout expe1fo1ents at high altitudes from balloons in the autumn of 1955 to determine if the suit designed for the U-2 pilot would also protect him during his parachute descent once he was separated· from the life-support mechanisms inside the 'aircraft. To avoid getting the "bends" during such descents or during .the long flights, pilots had to ~on their pressure suits and begin breathing oxygen at. least 90 minutes b.efore takeoff so that their bod­ ies w'ould have time to dissipate nitrogen. This procedure was known as prebreathing. Once the pilots were in· their suits, eating a.nd.drink­ ing becan1e a n1ajor probleffi, as did urination. The first model of the pressure suit, used by Lockheed test pilots, made no provision for uri­ nation: A subsequent model required the pilot to be catheterized be­ fore donning his flying suit. This method of permitting urination during night prov.ed very uncom.fortablc and, by the autumn of 1955, was replaced with an external bladder arrangement that made the catheter unnecessary. lb reduCc elimination, pilots ate a !ow-bulk, high-protein diet on the day before and the morning of each mission . .l.• Lecture by M::ij.

Project personnel also pioneered in the development of ready-to-eat foods in squeezable containers. These were primarily bacon- or cheese-flavored mixtures that the pilot could squeeze into his mouth using the self-sealing hole in the face mask.

Some did; most did. not." DELIVERY OF THE FIRST U-2 On 25 July, less than eight months after the go-ahead call from Trevor Gardner, Kelly Johnson was ready to deliver the first aircraft, known as artic.Je 341, to the "Paradise Ranch" site. With its long, slender wings and tail assembly removed, the aircraft was wrapped in tarpaulins, loaded aboard a C-124, and ftown to Groom Lake, where Lockheed me­ chanics spent the next six days readying the craft for its maiden· Hight. Before "Kelly's Angel" could actually take to the.air, however, it needed an Air Force designator. Col. Allman T. Culbertson from the Air Force's Office of the Director of Research and Development pointed this out to Lieutenant Colonel Geary in July 1955, and the two officers then looked through the aircraft designator handbook to see what the options were. They decided that tl1ey could not call the project aircraft a bomber, fighter, or transport plane, and they did not want anyone to know that the new plane was for reconnaissance, so Geary and Culbertson decided that it should come under the· utility aircraft category. iu the time, there were only two utility aircraft on the books, a U-1 and a U-3. Geary told Culbertsoi1 that the Lockheed CL-282 was going to be known officially as the U-2." ll /\l ihe time this Dir:ectornte was known as the Deputy· Directorate/Plans, with the slash interpreted to mean eilher "for" or "of.''

When the U-2 first took to tlie air, however, these engi_nes were not available becaus~ the entire production was needed to power specially configured Canberra RB-57Ds for the Air Force. The first U-2s there­ fore used P&W J57/P-37 engines, which were 276 pounds heavier anci delivered only 10,200 pounds of thrust at sealevel; the resulting SECRET I 11 I C01462740 GEGReT Sec1 et NOFORN Chapter 2 68 power-to-weight ratio of 2.7:1 was almost 20 percent less efficient than the preferred P-31 version." · To conduct lengthy nusswns · over hostile territory, the U-2 needed to carry a large amount of fuel. Kelly .Jopnson used_ a "wet-wing" design for the U-2, which meant that fuel was not stored in separate fuel tanks but rather in the wing itself. Eacli wing·was di­ vided into two leak-proof compartments, and fuel was pumped into all the cavities within these areas; only the outer 6 feet of the wings were not used for fuel storage. The U-2 also had a 100-gallon reserve tank in its nose. Later, in 1957, Johnson increased the fuel capacity of the U-2 by adding 100-gallon "slipper" tanks under each wing, pro­ jecting slightly ahead of the leading edge. · · One of the most important considerations in. the U-2's fuel sys­ tem ·was the need to maintain aircraft trim as the fuel was consumed .. The aircraft therefore contained a complex system of feed lines and valves draining to a central sump, which made it impossible to pro­ vide the pilot with an empty/full type of fuel gauge. None of the first 50 U-2s had normal fuel gauges. Instead there were mechanical fuel totalizer/counters. Before the start of a mission, the ground crew set the counters to indicate the total amount of fuel in the wings, ·and then a flow meter subtracted the gallons of fuel actually cons.urned during tl1e flight. The pilot kept a log of the fuel consumption shown by the counters and compared it with estimates made by miss~on planners for each leg of the flight. As a double check, U-2 pilots also kept track of their.Juel consumption by monitocjng airspeed and time in the air. Most pilots became quite expert at this. Several who did not cam~ up short of their home base during the 20 years these planes were flown.' 1 INITIAL TESTING OF THE U-2 Preliminary taxi trials began on 27 July 1955, when the first run down the newly completed runway took the plane to 50 knots.

LeVier accelerated to 70 knots and began to try the ailerons. "It was at this point that Tbecame aware of being air­ borne," LeVier noted afterward, "which left me with utter amaze­ ment, as l had no intentions whatsoever of flying. I immediately started back toward ihe ground, but had difficulty determining my height because the lakebed had no markings to judge distance or height. l made contact witl1 the ground in a left bank of approximately 10 degrees." The U-2 bounced back into the air, but LeVier was able to bring it back down for a second landing. He then applied the brakes· with little effect, and the aircraft rolled for a long distance before coming to a stop:" 2 Bissell, Cunningham, and Johnson saw the aircraft fall and bounce. Leaping into a jeep, they roared off toward the plane. They signaled to Le Vier to climb out and then used fire extinguishers to put out a fire in the brakes. At a debriefing session lhal followed, LeVier complained about the poor performance of the brakes and the absence of markings on the runway. Damage to the prototype U-2 was very minor: blo\vn tires, a leaking oleostrut on the undercan·iage, and dam­ aged brakes. This unplanned flight was but a foretaste of the airwor­ thiness of the U-2. New .pilots all had difficulty in getting the U-2's . wheels on the ground because at low speeds it would remain in ground effect and glide effortlessly above the runway for great dis­ ·tances. Taxi trials continued for one more day and were followed by the first planned flight on 4 August 1955. LeVier was again at the con­ trols and had been instructed by Kelly Johnson to land the U-2 by making initial contact with the main or forward landing gear and let­ ting the plane settle back on the rear wheel. LcVier had disagreed with this approach, believing that lhe U-2 would bounce if he tried to touch down on the fotward gear firs(. After.flying tl1e aircraft up·to 8',000 feet, LeVier leveled off and began cycling the landing gear up and down; then he tested the flaps and the plane's stability and control systems. Finally, l.,eVier made his first landing approach. As the U-2 settled down, the forward landing gear touched the runway and the plane skipped and bounced into the air. Le Vier made a second attempt to land front wheels first, and again the plane bounded into the air . •, Transi.:ripls of rhe lest pilots' and observers' -commenls on the initial 0~2 test flights h:ive hcen published in "Secret First Flight of Article 001," Spyplanes vol. 2, 1988, pp. 64-71, 82-85.

This first phase of U-2 testing explored the craft's stall envelope, took the aircraft lo its maximum stress limit (2.5 g's), and explored its speed potential. LeVier soon ftew the aircraft at its maximum speed of Mach 0.85. Flight tests continued, with the U-2 ascending to alti­ tudes never before attained in sustained flight. On 16 August LeVier took the aircraft up to 52,000 feet. In preparation for this Hight, the 42-year-old test pilot completed the Air Force partial-pressure suit training progran1, beco1ning the oldest pilot to do so. Testing at even higher altitudes continued, and on 8 September the U-2 ·reached its initial design altitude of 65,600 feet.'' On 22 September 1955, the U-2 experienced its first ftameoul at 64,000 feet-more than 12 miles up. After a brief restart, the J57/ P-37 engine again flamed out at 60,000 feet, and the aircraft descended .to 35,000 feet before the engine could be relit. Engineers from Pratt & Whitney immediately set to work on this problem. The P-37 model engine had significantly poorer combustion characteris­ tics than the prefened but unavailable P-31 version and therefore tended ·to ftame out at high alti.tudes. Combustion problems usually became apparent as the U-2. began the final part of its climb from 57,000 to 65,000 feet, causing pilots to refer to this area as the "bad­ lands" or the "chimney." Flameouts bedeviled \he U-2. project until sufficient numbers of the more powerful P-31 engines became avail­ able in the spring of 1956." Meanwhile, with the airworthiness of the U-2 airframe proven, Lockheed set up a production line in the Skunk Works, but delivery Of even the second-choice J57/P-37 engines became a major problem. Pratt.& Whitney's full production capacity for these engines for the next year was contracted to the Air force for use in F-100 fighters and KC-135 tankers.

The project staff decided that the simplest approach would be to fly the essential personnel- to the site on Monday morning and return them to Burbank on Friday evening.-Frequent flights were also neces­ sary to bring in supplies and visitors from contractors and headquar­ ters. Therefore, a regularly scheduled Militmy Air Transport Service (MATS) flight using a USAF C-54 aircraft began on 3 October 1955. James Cunningham promptly dubbed this activity "Bissell's Narrow-Gauge Airline ... Less than seven weeks after it ·started, a MATS aircraft bound for Area 51 crashed on 17 Novem\Jer, killing all 14 persons aboard the plane, including the Project Security Officer, ClA's William H. Ma1T, four members of his staff, and personnel from Lockheed and Hycon. This crash represented the greatest single loss of life in the entire U-2 p1:ogra111." · . . . U-2s, UFOs, AND OPERATION BLUE BOOK High-altitude testing of the U-2 soon led to an unexpected side effect-a tre1nendous increase in reports of unidentifi.ed flying objects (UFOs). In the mid-1950s, most commercial airliners llew at altitudes between 10,000 and 20,000 feet and military aircraft like the B-47s. and B-57s operated at altitudes· below 40,000 feet. Consequently, once U-2s started Hying at altitudes above 60,000teet, air-traffic con­ trollers began receiving increasing nutnbers of UFO reports. Such reports were most prevalent In the early evening hours ·rrom pilots of airliners flying from east to west. When the sun dropped below the horizon of an air!iner·flying at 20,000 feet, the plane was in darkncss:But, if a U-2. was airborne in the vicinity of the airliner at the san1e ti1nc, its horizon fro1n an altitude of 60,000 feet was considerably n1ore distant, and,.being so high in the sky, its silver wings would catch and reflect the rays of the sun and appear to tne airliner pilot, 40,000 feet below, to be fiery ·objects. Even <luring day­ light hours, the silver bodies of the high-flying U-2s could catch the sun and cause reflections or glints that could be seen at lower alti­ tudes and even on the ground. Al this time, no one believed manned flight was possible above 60,000 feet, so no one expected to see an object so high in the sky. •H OSA History, chap. 7, p(J. 17-19 ryS Codeword). Sesret I I C01462740 Secret f -Se6i:Gt NOFORN Chapter 2 73 Not only did the airline pilots report their sightings to air-traffic controllers, but they and ground-based observers also wrote letters to the Air Force unit at Wright Air Development Command in Dayton charged with investigating such phenomena. This, in turn, led to the . Air Force's Operation BLUE BOOK. Based at Wright-Patterson, the operation collected all reports of UFO sightings. Air Force investiga­ tors then attempted to explain such sightings by linking them to natu­ ral phenomena. BLUE BOOK investigators regularly called on the Agency's Project Staff in Washington to check reported UFO sight­ ings against U-2 flight logs. This enabled the investigators to elimi­ nate the majority of the UFO reports, although they could not reveal to the letter writers the true cause of the UFO sightings. U-2·and later OXCART flights accounted for more than one-half of all UFO reports during the late 1950s and most of the 1960s." · HIRING U-2 PILOTS In authorizing the U-2 project, President Eisenhower told DC! Dulles that he wanted tl1e piloL• of tl1ese planes to be non-US citizens. It was his belief that, should a U-2 come down in hostile territory, it would be much easier for the United -States to deny any responsibility for the activity if the pilot was not an American.

Bissell therefore had to start the search for U-2 pilots all over again. Lt. Gen. Emmett (Rosy) O'Donnell, the Air Force's Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel, auU1orized the use of Air Force pilots and provided considerable assistance in tl1e search for pilots who met the high standards established by the Agency and the. Air Force. The search included only SAC fighter pilots who held reserve commissions. The use of regular Air Force pilots was not considered because of the complexities involved in having them resign from the Air Force, a procedure that was necessary in order to hire them as ci­ vilians for the AQUATONE project. SAC pilots interested in the U-2 project had to be willing to re­ sign from the Air Force and assume civilian status-a process known as sheep-dipping-in order to conduct the overflights. Although Air Force pilots were attracted by the challenge of !lying U-2s over hos­ tile territory, they were reluctant to leave the service and give up their seniority. To overcome pilots' reluc1ance, the Agency offered hand­ some salaries, .and the Air Force promised each pilot that, upon satis­ factory conclusion of his employment with the Agency, he could return to his unit: In tl1e meantime, he would be considered for pro­ motion along with his contemporaries who had continued their Air Force careers. 51 The selection process for Agency U-2 pilots was very rigorous. Because of the strain involved in flying at extreme altitudes for long periods of time, painstaking efforts were made to exclude all pilots who might be nervous or unstable in any way. The physical and psy­ chological screening of potential U-2 pilots was conducted by the Lovelace Foundation for Medical Education . and Research in Albuquerque, New Mexico, under a contract signed with the CIA on 11 ' OSA History, chap. 10, pp. 1-10 rJ6 Codeword); Geary interviewffi ·" OSA History, chap. 10, pp. 5-6 ~Codeword); Geary interview (S); Francis Gary Powers with Curt Gentry, Operation Overjlighr (New York: Holt, Rinehart, and Wilson, 1970), pp. 25-27.

The C!A's insistence on inore stringent physical and mental examinations than tl1ose used by the Air Force to se.lect pilo,ls for its U-2 fleet resulted in a higher rejection rate of candidates.. The Agency's selection criteria remained high throughout its manned overflight program and resulted in a much lower accident rate for CIA U-2 pilots than for their counterparts in the Air Force program." PILOT TRAINING Even before the recruiting effort got under way, the Air Poree and CIA began Lo develop a pilot training program. Under the terms of the OILSTONE agreement between the Agency and the Air Force, re­ sponsibility for pilot training lay with SAC. This essential activity was carried out under the supervision of Col. William F. Yancey, ·who was assigned to March AFB and flew.to nearby Area 51 each day. Colonel Yancey was in charge of six SAC pilots who were to be trained by Lockheed test pilots to fly the U-2. Once they became gcialified, these SAC pilots would become the trainers for the "sheep-dipped" former Reserve SAC pilots, who would fly U-2 mis­ sions for the CIA. The original U-2 test pilot, Tony LeVier, trained several other Lockheed test pilots in the difficult art of flying the U-2. Eventually there were enough trained Lockheed pilots available to test the air- · craft coming off the assembly line and also train the SAC pilots. Training was difficult because there ·was no two-scat model of the .. U-2. All instruction ha"d to be given on the ground before takeoff and then over the radiq once the craft was airborne. Aln1ost J5 years elapsed before a two-seat U-2 V(as available for training new piloti. Despite the difficulties involved in training U-2 pilots, Colonel Yancey had a cadre of six qualified Air Force U-2 pilots by Septemher 1955. These six were now ready to train the Agency's pi­ lots.'· 1 Training pilots was not easy because the U·2 was a 1nixture of glider and jet. Although those chosen for the overflight program were all qualified fighter pilots, they now had to learn to fly the delicate U-2. !ts large wings had tremendous iift but were also very fragile ... n OSA Hl.v1ory, chap.

Moreover, the original U-2s were placarded, which meant that they could not be ftown at sea level fastei· than 190 knots in smooth air or 150 knots in rough air. At operational altitude, where the air was much less dense, they could not exceed Mach 0.8 (394 knots). Speeds in excess of these limils could cause the wings cir tail section to fall off. Airspeed was a very critical factor for the U-2. At maximum alti­ .tudc only 6 knots separated the speeds at which low-speed stall and high-speed buffet occurred. Pilots called this narrow range of accept­ able airspeeds at tnaximu1n altitude the "coffin corner" because at this point the U-2 was always on the brink of falling out of the sky .. If the aircraft slowed beyond the. low-speed stall limit, it would lose lift and begin to fall, causing stresses that would tear the wings and tail off. A little too much speed would· lead to buffeting, which would also cause the loss of.the wings or tail. Flying conditions such as these required a U-2 pilot's full attention when he .was not using the · autopilot. Airspeed was such a critical factor that Kelly Johnson added a vernier adjustment to tl1e throttle to allow the pilot to make minllle alterations to the fuel supply.'" Among the unique devices developed for the U-2 was a small sextant for n1aking celestial "fixes" dudng the long overflights. Because cloud cover often prevented U-2 pilots from locating naviga­ tional points on the earth thro·ugh the periscope, the sextant turned out to be the pilots' principal navigational instmmen.t during the first three years of deployment. When clouds were not a factor, however, the periscope proved highly accurate for navigation. During the final tests before the aircraft became operational; U-2 pilots found they could navigate· by dead reckoning with an erro1' of less than 1 nautical 111ile over a 1,000-nrn course." FINAL TESTS OF THE U-2 Flight-testing of the U-2 continued throughout the fall and winter of 1955-56 in order to test all the various systems.

These officials concun-ed with Yancey's determi­ nation that the U-2 was ready for deployment." During these final tests in tl1e spring of 1956, tl1e U-2 once again demonstruted its unique airworthiness. On 14 April 1956, James Cunningham was .sitting in his office in Washington when he reeeived a call from Area 51 informing him that :i westward-bound U-2 had experienced a fiameout over the Mississippi River at the western bor­ der of Tennessee. After res"truting his engine,· the pilot reported a sec­ ond flameout and engine vibrations so violent that he was unable to gel the power plant to start again. Early in [he program Bissell and Ritland had foreseen such an emergency and, with the cooperation of. the Air Force, had a>Tanged for sealed orders to be delivered to every airbase in the continental United States giving instructions about what . to do if a U-2 needed to make an emergency landing. · Cunningham had the project office ask the pilot how far he could · glide so they could determine which SAC base should be alerted. The · ·pilot, who by this rime was over Arkansas, ;adioed back that, given the prevailing winds and the U-2's 21 :! glide ratio, he thought he could reach Albuquerque, New Mexico.

General Koon told the base commander about the sealed orders and explained that an unusual aircraft would make a deadstick landing at Kirtland within the next half hour. The general then instructed the base commander to have air police keep everyone away from the craft and get it inside a banger as quickly as possible. After a half hour passed, the b~se commander called the Pentagon to ask where the crippled aircraft was. As he was speaking, the officer saw the U-i touch down on the runway and remarked, "It's not a plane, it's a glider!" Even more surprised were the air po­ lice who surrounded the craft when it came to a halt. As the pilot cli1nbed from the cockpit in his "space" suit, one air police1nan re­ mar~cd that the pilot looked like a man from Mars. The pilot, Jacob Kratt, later reported to Cunningham that, from the beginning of the first flameout until the landing at Albuquerque, the U-2 had covered over 900 miles, including more than 300 by gliding." . Aside from this extraordinary gliding ability, however, tl1e U-2 was a very difficult aircraft to fiy. Its very light weight, which enabled it to achieve extreme alliiude, also made it very fragile. The aircraft was also very sleek, and it sliced through the air with little drag. This feature was dangerous, however, because the u:2 was not built to wit.hstand the G-forces of high speed. Pilots had !O be.extremely care­ ful to keep .the· craft in a. slightly nose-up .attitude when .flying at operational.altitude. If the· nose dropped only a degree or two into the nose-down position, the plane would gain speed at a dramatic rate, exceeding the placarded speed limit irl less than a minute, at which point the aircraft would begin to come apart. Pilots, therefore, had to pay close attention to the aircraft's speed indicator because at 65,000 feet there was no physical sensation of speed, without objects close at hand for the eye to use as a reference." THREE FATAL CRASHES IN 1956 The first fatality directly connected with flying the U-2 .occurred on 15 May 1956, when test pilot Wilburn S.

Once airborne, Rose made a low-level pass over the airstrip and shook loose the lefthand pogo. When he attempted to make a righthand tum to come back over the runway to shake loose the remaining pogo, Rose stalled the U-2 and it plunged to eartl1, disintegrating over a wide area. Three months I later, on 31 August 1956, a second fatal crash occurred during a night-flying exercise. Frank G. Grace stalled article 354 at an altitude I of about 50 feet when he tried to climb too steeply at takeoff. The craft fell, cartwheeled on its left wing, and struck a power pole· near -i the rnnway. More experienced ·u-2 pilots always cut back abruptly on the throttle as soon as the pogo sticks fell away in order to avoid such stalls. · Before the year was out, two more U-2s Were destroyed in crashes, one of them fatal. On 17 September 1956, article 346 lost part of its right wing while on its takeoff ascent from Lindsey Air. Force Base in Wiesbaden, Germany. 111e aircraft disintegrated in.mid­ air, killing pilot How~rd Carey. T.he loss of article 357 on 19 December 1956 resulted from pilot hypoxia. A small leak prema­ turely depicted the oxygen supply and impaired Robert J. Ericson's judgn1ent as he flew over Arizona. Because of his inability to act quickly and keep track of his aircraft's speed, the U,2 exceeded the placarded speed of 190 knots and literally disintegrated when it reached 270 knots. Ericson managed to jettison the canopy and was sucked out of the aircraft at 28,000 feet. His chute opened automati­ cally at 15,000 feet, and he landed without injury. The aircraft was a total loss."' COORDlNATlON OF COLLECTION REQUIREMENTS From the very beginning of the U-2 program, it was apparent that some sort of an in\eragency task force .or office would be needed to develop and coordinate c6UecUon reguirements for the covert over­ head reconnaissance effort.

Following a _meet­ ing with Deputy Secretary of Defense Donald Quarles and Trevor Gardner (who had-been promoted from his special assistant post to become Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Research and. Development), Richard Bissell established an Ad Hoc Requirements Committee (ARC) on l December 1955. He then named James Q­ Reber to be Intelligence Requirements Officer for the U-2 project and chairman of the ARC. Reber was already experienced in coordination with other intelligence agencies, for he had headed the Directorate of Intelligence DI Office of Intelligence Coordination for four years. The first full-scale ARC meeting took place on I February 1956 with representatives from the Army, Navy, and Air Force present Attending for the CIA were representatives from the Office of Research and Reports (ORR) and the Office of Scientific Intelligence (OSI). The CTA membership later expanded to include the Office of Current Intelligence (OCI) and a representative from the Directorate of Plans. In 1957 the National Security Agency (NSA) also began sending a representative. The Slate Department followed suit in 1960, although it had been receiving reports from the committee all along." ARC's main task was to draw up lists of collection requirements, primadly for the U-2, but also for other means of collection. These lists prioritized target< according to their ability to meet the three ma­ jor national intelligence objectives concerning the Soviet Union in the mid-1950s: long-range bombers, guided missiles, and nuclear energy.

Project GENETRIX involved the use of camera-can-ying balloons to obtain high-altitude photography of. Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union, and Sec.ret SECRET C01462740 SECR.ET ~NOFORN Chapter 2 85 lhe People's Republic of China. This project had ils ongms in a RAND Corporation study from 1951. By the end of 1955, the Air Force had ovcrco1ne a nu1nber of technical problem·s in ca1ncra design and recovery techniques and had 1nanut~1ctured a large nun1ber of bal­ loons for use fn the project. President Eisenhower gave his approval 6n 27 December 1955, and two weeks later the launches from bases in Western Europe began. lly the end ol' February \ 956, the Air Force had launched a total of S 16 balloons. 67 •• Project GENETRIX was much less successful than its ·sponsors had hored. Once launched, the balloons were at the mercy of the pre­ vailing winds, and 1nany tended to drift to\.vard southern Europe and rhen across the Black Sea and the clese11 areas of China. These bal­ loons therefore 111issed the prin1e target an~as, \Vhich lay in the higher latitudes. Large nu1nbers of balloons did not succeed in crossing the Soviet Union and China, son1e because they were shot down hy hos­ .tile aircraft, others because they prematurely expended their' ballast supplies and descended loo soon. Only 46 payloads were eventually recovered (one more than a year later and' the last not until 1958) from the 516 balloons that had been launched. fn four of these pay­ loads the ca1nera had n1al-functioned, and in another eight the photog­ n1phy was of no intclligc11cc value. Thus, only 34 balloons succeeded in obtaining us~ful photographs.{,R The low success rale of ciic Project GENETRIX balloons was not the only problern encountered; far n1ore serious was the storm of pro­ test ctnd unfavora!)le publicily that the .balloon overflight$ provoked. Al though the Air Force had issued a cover story that the balloons were being used for weath.er research connected with the International Geophysical Year, East European nations protested strongly to the United States and to international aviation authorities, claiming that the balloons endangered civilian aircraft. The Soviet l.Jnion sent strongly worded protest notes to the United States and the nationi; from which the balloons had been launched.

See1 et C01462740 ~EiGRET / Seerst NOFORN Chapter 2 87 Although the photo intelligence gained from Project GENETR!X was limited in quantity, it was still some of the best and most com­ plete photography obtained of the Soviet Union since .World War II. It was referred to as "pioneer" photography because it provided a base­ line for all future overhead photography. Even innocuous photos of· snch things as forests and strea111s proved valuable in later years when U-2 and satellite photography revealed construction activity. Of ~till greater iinportancc to the U-2 progran1,.however, was the dala that US and NATO radars obtalned as they tracked the paths of the balloons-whose average altitude was 45,800 feet-over the Soviet Bloc. This data provided the most accurate record to date of high-altitude wind currents, knowledge that meteorologists were later able to put to use to determine· optimum ftightpaths for U-2 flights. One completely fortuitous development from .Project GENETRIX had nothing to do with the cameras but involved a steel bar. This bar served a dual purpose: the rigging of the huge polyethyl­ ene gasbag was secured to the top of the har and the camera-payload and· automatic-ballasting equipment was attached to the bottom. By sheer chance, the length of the bar--91 centimeters-corresponded to the wavelength of the radio frequency used hy a Soviet radar known by its NATO designator as 'JDKEN. This was an S-band radar used by Soviet forces for early warning and ground-controlled intercept. The har on the GENETRIX balloons resonated when struck by TOKEN radar pulses, making it possible for radar operators at US and NATO installations on the periphery of the Soviet ljnion to locate a number of previously unknown TOKEN radars. These radar findings, coupled with ·other intercepis made during the ballo<.?n flights, provided extensive data on Warsaw Pact radar net­ works, radar sets, and ground-controlled interception techniques. Analysis of these intercepts revealed the altitude capabilities and tracking accuracy of radars, the n1ethods used by Warsaw Pact nations to notify each other of the balloons' passage (handing off), and the altitudes at which Soviet aircraft could intercept the balloons. All of this infonnafion could be directly applied to future U-2 niissions. 72 •l Finnl Report, Project ! 19L, !st Air Di\•ision (Mcteorologicn.1 Survey) S!rategic Air Command, 5 l'vlarch 1956.

Therefore, DDCJ Cabell wrote to Air Force Chief of Staff Twining in February 1956 to warn against further balloon flights because ol'the "additional political pressures being generated against all balloon operations and overll,ights, thus increasing the difficulties of policy decisions which would permit such operations in the future." n In addition to its concern for the future of the l:J-2 program; the Agency feared that President Eisenhower's anger at balloon ·over­ flights might result in die curtailment of the balloon program that the Free Europe Committee-a cove1i Agency operation based in West Germany-used to release propaganda pamphlets over Eastern Europe. AOUATONE BRIEFINGS FOR SELECTED MEMBERS OF CONGRESS Although knowledge of the U-2 project was a closely guarded se­ cret within both the Agency mid the Eisenhower administration, DC!

In February 1956, while the controversy over balloon flight• was still .raging and the U-2 was completing it~ final airworthiness tests, Richard Bissell and his staff hegan working on a cover story for over­ sea}; operations. lt was iinportant to have a plauSible ~eason for de­ ploying such an unusual looking plane, whose glider wings and odd landing gear were certain t~ arouse curiosity. Bissell decided that the best cover for tl1e deployment of the U-2 was an ostensible niission of high,altitude weather research by the National Advisory Commit.tee on Aeronautics (NACA). Such a cover story, however, needed the approval of all concerned: Air Force intel­ ligence, the Air Weather Service, the Third Air Force, the Seventl1 Air Division, the SAC U-2 project. officer, the Air Force Headquarters project officer, and NACA's top official, Dr. Hugh Dryden. Moreover, the CIA Scientific Advisory Committee was also consulted abourthe cover plan. Senior CIA ofiicials and the other agencies involved in provid­ ing cover for the U-2 approved the final versi01) of the overall cover story ril the end of March 1956. The project staff then began working on contingency plans for the loss of a u..:2 over hostile territory. Bissell advised the project's cover officer to "produce a document which scts•forth all actions to be taken ... not only press releases and the public line to be taken, but also tl1e sus_pension of operations and at least an indication of the diplomatic action ....We should at least make the uttempl in this case .10 be prepared for the worst in a really orderly fashion." The cover officer then prepared emergency proce­ dures based on the overall weatl1er research cover sto1y, and Bissell approved these plans. There was one final high-level look at the cover story on 21 June i:9s6, the tluy after the llrst U-2 niission over Eastern Europe, when Bissell 1net with General Goodpaster, James Killian, and Edwin Land to discuss the pending overflights of the Soviet Union, including the proposed emergency procedures. Killian and Land disagreed with Bisscll's concept and made a much bolder and more forthright proposal: in the event of the loss of a U-2 over hostile territory, the United States should not try to deny responsibility b_ut should stale tlrnt overflights were being conducted "to guard against surprise Ultacl(." This proposal was put aside for further thought (which it never received), and Bisscll's weather research cover re­ mained the hasis for statements to be made after a loss. The project staff then went on to prepare a number of.different starements to be· See1et Secret C01462740 SECRET Seta et NOFORN Chapter 2 90 used in various scenarios, including one in whiCh the pilot was cap­ tured.

U-2 Operations in the Soviet Bloc and Middle East, 1956-1968 By Januacy 1956, everyone working on Project AQUATONE could see that the U-2 was nearing the time for operational deployment. During tests the aircraft had met all the criteria established in late 1.954. Its range of 2,950 miles was sufficient to overtly continents, its altitude of 72,000 feet was beyond the reach of all known antiaircraft weapons and interceptor aircraft, and its ca1nera lenses were the finest available. Because the main targets for the U-2 lay behind the Iron Curtain, Bissell and his staff began looking for operational bases in Europe. The United Kingdom, America's closest ally, seemed the \ogical choice for U-2 bases, and, on 10 January 1956, Bissell flew to London to discuss the matter with Royal Air Force (RAF) and Ml-6 officials. Their initial response was favorable, but they told Bissell that the proposal needed approval at a much higher level. Bissell reported his findings to DC{ Dulles, who promptly ar­ ranged to meet with Foreign Secretary Selwyn Lloyd in London to explore the possibility of winning the British Government's approval for the project. Dulles .presented his case to Lloyd on 2 February, and, by early March, Prime Minister Anthony Eden approved the basing of U-2s in the United Kingdom. The U-2s were to use Lakenheath AFB, an RAF base nlso used by the USAF Strategic Air Command (SAC).'

U-2 detachment, consisting of four aircraft and pilots, was known publicly as the I st Weather Reconnaissance Squadron, Provisional (WRSP-1). The "provisional" designation · gave the U-2 detachments greater security because provisional Air Fo_rce units did not have lo report to higher headquarters. WRSP-1, known within the Agency as Derachment A, began deploying to the United Kingdom on 29 April 1956. By 4 May, all of lhe detachment's personnel and equipment, including four aircraft, had arrived" at Lakenheath.' Shortly after deployment, on 7 May, the National Advisory Committee on Aeronautics (NACA) released an unclassified U-2 cover story stating that a _Lockhccd,dcveloped aircraft would be flown by the USAF Air Weather Service to study such high-altitude phenom­ ena as the jet stream, convective clouds, temperature and wind struc­ tures at jet-stream levels, and cosmic-ray effects up to 55,000 feet' Before overflights could begin from Lakenheath, however, sev­ eral incidents occurred that dampened Prime Minisler Ecl('!n'.s interest in having the U-2s on British terri_tory. In-mid-April 1956, a Soviet naval squadron brought Soviet leaders Nikita Khrushchev and Nikolai Bulganin on an -official visit to the United Kingdom.

His headless -body was later found washed up on a beach. This so-called Frogman Incident caused an uproar in Parliament and a protest from Moscow that soured relations between the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union. To avoid further deterioration of Anglo-Soviet relations, the Prime Minister wrote to President Eisenhower on 16 May asking that overtlights be postponed. Only two days later, a U-2 on a training flight from Lakenheath inadvertently penetrated the British radar net­ work, causing RAF fighters to scramble. Afterward the Air, Minisiry made a public announcement that a special NACA aircraft was con­ ducting high-altitude research in _the United Kingdom.

The det.:1chment coinmander, Col. Frederick McCoy, ..yas disappointed in his hope that the redeployment of the U-2s could be accomplished without drawing undue .attention.

Soon after the four U-2s arrived in Wiesbaden, they were refitted with the more powerful J57/P-31 engines. The new engines were bet­ ter suited for operations behind the Iron Curtain because they were less likely to suffer ftameouts than the earlier model. Once the new engines were installed, the aircraft received the designation U-2B. 6 Bissell was anxious to get the overflights _started by late June because SAC weather experts had predicted that the bes_t weather for photographing. the Soviet Union would be between 20 June and I 0 July. Bissell, however·, had not yet received final authorization from President Eisenhower to begin overflights of the Soviet Union.

He had always insisted that overflights by military aircraft were too provocative, and in 1954 he had therefore supported the J_,and conunittee's proposal for an unarmed civilian aircrafr instead of the rnilitary reconnaissance planes favored by the Air Force. For the same reason, Eisenhower had resisted attempL' by the Air Force to take the U-2 program away from the CIA in I 955. In fact, th~ President's desire to avoid secret reconnaissance mis­ sions over the Soviet Union, \Vith all tl~eir risks, led l'lim to n1ake liis· famous "Open Skies" proposal in the summer of 1955, when the U-2 was still under development but making goocl progress. At the Geneva summit conference on 21 July 1955, President Eisenhower offered to provide airfields and other facilities ill' the United States for the Soviet Union to conduct aerial photography of all US n1ilit:iry in­ stallations if th.e Soviet Union would provide the United States with similar facilities in Russia .. Not surprisingly, Sovi'ei leader Nikita Khrushchev almost immediately rejected• Eisenhower's offer: Although the President had hoped that the Soviet llnion would accept his propos,;I, he was prepared fo'r rejection. While Open Skies was stilf being considered, Eisenhower had stated, 'Tl! give it one shot. Then if they don't accept. it, we'll tly the U-2."'

SeGret SECRET C01462740 GEC~EI Secret NOFORN Chapter 3 97 Even though President Eisenhower had approved every stage of the U-2's development, knowing full well that the aircraft was being built to fly over the Soviet Union, the actual decision to authorize such flights was very difficult for him. He remained concerned that overflights could poison relations with the Soviet Union and might even lead to hostilities. One argument that helped overcome the President's reluctance was the C!A's longstanding contention that U-2 flights might actually go undetected because Soviet radars would not be able to track aircraft at such high altitudes. This belief was based on a 1952 study of Soviet World War II-vintage radars and on 1955 tests using US. radars, which-unknown to US ·officials-were not.as effective as Soviet radars against high-altitude targets. Shortly before U-2 operations began, however, the CIA's Office of Scientific Intelligence (OSI) conducted a vulnerability study of the U-2 that was published on 28 May 1956. The study's conclusion was that "Maxi­ mum Soviet radar detection ranges against the Project aircraft at ele­ vation in excess of 55,000 feet would vary from 20 to 150 miles..... In our opinion, detection can therefore be assumed." The OSI study added, however, "[tis doubtful that the Soviets can achieve consis­ tent tracking of the Project vehicle."' Completed just.three weeks be­ fore the initation of overflights, this study seems to have had little impact on the thinking of the top project officials. They.continued to believe that the Soviets would not be able to track the U-2 and might eveD fail to detect it, except for possible vague indications." ' . Soviet radars were not President Eisenhower's only concern. Also fearing that a malfunction might cause a U-2 to crash inside the Soviet Union, he asked Allen Dulles what the consequences would be. The President's staff secretary, Col.· Andrew J. Goodpaster, who was present at virtually all White House meetings on the U-2 project and served as the President's intenncdiary to the CIA on this issue, later recalled: Allen~· approach ~vas that we 1vere unlikely to lose one. lfu1e did lose one, the pilot 1vould not survive. . . .

CIA assurances that the U-2 would probably not be detected, and that a crashed U-2 could not be traced back to the Uitited States, helped overcome the President's worries about overflights. The most important reason why President Eisenhower decided to send recon­ naissance aircraft over the Soviet U~ion 1 however, was the urgent need for accurate intelligence to confirm or disprove claims of Soviet advances in long-range bomqers and missiles. The initial sighting of the new Soviet 13json bomber in the spring of 1954 had been followed by reported sightings of more than 30 of these bombers in the spring and summer of 1955 (in reality these were sightings of the same group of 10 aircraft that 'circled around out or sight and made several passes ·during a Soviet air show). Soon members o.f Congress were calling for investigations into \he relative strength of the_ US and Quoted in Deschloss. Muyduy, p. I18. Seet=et 11 C01462740 SECRET ~NOFORN Chapter 3 99 Soviet Air Fc;>rces." Early in J 956, concern about a possible Soviet advantage in long-range bombers grew as Air Force Chief of Staff '!Wining informed the Senate Armed Services Committee that the Soviet Union already had more Bisons than the United States had B-52s and that the Soviets would be able'to "maintain this advantage for some time if they keep on the production curve we are now pre­ dicting."" By May 1956, reporting on the growing Soviet air strength was no longer confined to aviation journals; U.S. News and World Report, fo1· example, featured ruticles headlined "Can Soviets 'I'dke the Air Lead?" and "ls U.S. Really Losing in the Air?" " . Alongside fear of possible Soviet .superiority in long-range bombers came a new potential threat: Soviet progress in guided mis­ sile research. Trevor Gardner, Air Force Assistant Secretary for Research and Dcvelop111enr1 warned in Seplernber l 955 that "the most complex and baffling technological mystery today is not the Russian capability in aircraft and nuclear weapons but rather what the Soviet progress has been in the field of guided missiles." " On 30 January !956, 11me magazine madi: the guided missile its cover story. The article began by describing a hypothetical crisis set in I 962 in which the United States suffered a humiliating defeat because it had lugged behind the Soviet Union in guided missile development." Just two weeks after this story appefiled, the Soviets successfully tested a missile with a range of 900 miles, and President Eisenhower admitted at apress conference that the Soviet Union might be ahead of the Unired States in son1e areas of the missile field.

" · Faced with. growing Congressional and public anxiety over Soviet offensive capabilties, President Eisenhower approved the pro­ posed overflight program. Colonel Goodpaster relayed this decision to Bissell, Land, and Killian at a meeting on 21 June.

But even after the President granted his approval on 21 June, such missions.could not yet take place for two reasons. First, President Eisenhower had agreed with a CIA and State Department recommendation that West Gennan Chancellor Konrad Adenauer be informed iii advance of US plans to overfly the Soviet Union from bases in Gennany (in keeping "!ith ex­ isting policies Adenauer was not informed about overflights of Eastern Europe). Second, Soviet pariy chief Nikita Khrushchev had invited repre~ent~tives of the US Air Force to "the Moscow Air Show, which opened on 23 June 1956 .. Led by Air Force Chief of Staff ;· Nathan F. 1Wining, the delegation would be in the Soviet Union for a week, and General Twining requested that no overflights of U1e Sov.iet Union be staged until the Air Force delegation had left" ' Both of these restrictio~s on overflights of the Soviet Union were cleared up by the end of June. Accompanied by Gen~ral Cabell and the Chief of Station for Germany, Tracy Barnes, Bissell briefed Chancellor Adenauer and his trusted adviser, State Secretary Hans Globke, on 27 June. Adenauer enthusiastically endorsed th.e project." A few days later the Air Force delegation returned from Moscow, but now unfavorable weather prevented the start of opera- · tions against the Soviet. Union. While waiting for the clouds over the Soviet Union to clear, Detachment A carried out two more overllights of Eastern Europe on 2 July I 956: mission 2009 over Czechoslovakia,, Hungary,, and Bulgaria; and.mission 2010 over East Germany, Poland, Hungary, and Romania. That afternoon Bissell and DDCI Cabell gave Presidept Eisenhower a detailed briefing on the first U-2 overflight, which the President found "very interesting, very positive." Eisenhower was anxious to know, however, whether radars bad tracked the aircraft. Bissell replied that, although East European radars had picked up-the 20 June flight, radar operntors had misread the altitude as only 42,000 feet. He added that the Agency was awaiting reports on that morn­ ing's flight' to see if they, too, had been detected.

The President. was obviously concerned that CIA estimates that the U-2. could fly virtually undetected were proviug false. One of the reasons why he had npproved t11e overflight program was the CIA's assurance that the Soviet Union would remain unaware of the flights or-m the very worst-receive only occasional, vague indicacions. FIRST U-2 FLIGHTS OVER THE. SOVIET UNION The question of how well the Soviets could track U-2 flights had not yet hecn settled when \he firsl overmghts of the Soviet Union took place. On Wednesday, 4 July 1956, the U-2 known as Article 347 be­ gan the firsr flight over the SovieL Union. Final authorization for mis­ sion 2013 had come shortly before ta!\eoff. Late 011 the evening of 3 July, Bi~sell went to projectheadquarlers in the Matomic Building to give the ~'Go" or "No go 11 cfecision. Although the President had ap­ proved the overflight, the final decision to start.a mission depended on a number of factors, especially the weather over the target area and at the takeoff and landing sites. Bissell made the decision just before midnight Washington tin1e1 which was six o'cJock in the rnon1ing in Wiesbaden. This pattern of last-minute apjirovals continued for the duration of the U-2 ov~rtlight program."' When Wiesbaden received the '"Gou signal, a U-2 equipped with an A-2 camera and flown by pilot Hervey Stockman took off on a course that to:ok it over Poznan, Poland, where riots had occurred on 28-30 June. After Poznan, Stockman headed for Bclorussia, where he turned north to Leningrad. The last leg of tl1e mission took the U-2 over the Soviet Baltic states before returning to Wiesbaden.

Mission 2013's route also overflew a number of major military airfields to make an inventory of the new Bison jet-engine heavy bomber. 2 ~ The second overflight, on the following day, continued the search for Bison bombers. Pilot Carmine Vito's route was similar but somewhat to the south of Stockman's and also flew farther east, more than 200 kilometers past Moscow. Although the Soviet capital was al­ most completely hidden by clouds, the A-2 camera with haze filters took some usable photographs of the city. These turned out to be the only U-2 photographs of Moscow because·no other mission was sent over the Soviet capital. Among the key targets photographed during mission 2014 were the Fili airframe piant, where tbe Bison was being built; the bomber arsenal at Ramenskoye, where the Bisons were test­ ed; the Kaliningrad missile plant; and the Khimki rocket-engine ,plant." . . When Allen Dulles returned to work on Thursday, 5 July 1956, he asked Bissell if any overflights had taken place during the 1 Independence Day holiday. One had been made on the fourth and an­ other just that morning, Bissell replied. (Because of the six-hour time difference, the 5 July flight was safely back in Wiesbaden by the time Dulles spoke to Bissell'.) When Dulles asked the routes of .tl1ese I I' 11 missions, Bissell told him that they had overflown both Moscow and Leningrad. "Oh my Lord," Dulles exclaimed, "do you think that · was wise the first time?" "Allen," Bissell replied, "the first is the safest. n n · President Eisenhower also wanted to know the results of the 4 and 5 July flights, but his principal concern was whether there. had bee11 any indication that either night had been discovered or tracked by radar.

Goodpaster called both D.ulles and Bissell and was told that reports on tracking or atten1pted interception of the U-2s would not be available for another 36 hours. Later that day the two CIA officials met with Goodpaster to ask if flights could continue in the meantime. Goodpaster replied that his understanding of the President's directive was that the operation should continue "at the maximum rate until the first evidence of tracking was received." 28 · ·Although President Eisenhower had originally.spoken of sus­ pending the overflights if they were "discover~d or tracked," his main con~ern was to learn if the Soviets coukl track U-2 1nissions, meaning that they could follow the ftight on their radar. screens for most or all of the missions and thus have numerous opportunities to attempt interception. Certainly the President hoped that U-2· flights could not even be detected, but reports received on the 20 June over­ flight of Eastern Europe had already indicated that this goal was unre­ alistic. The President's emphasis therefore shifted to tracking. lf \he Soviets could successfully track U-2 missions, he wanted the over-· .flights l)alted." Rep01ts on Soviet radar coverage of the first two overflights of the Soviet Union became available on 6 July. These re­ ports showed that, although the Soviets did detect the aircraft and made several very unsuccessful attempts at interception, they could not track U-2s consistently. Interestingly, the Soviet radar coverage was weakesl around the most important target.;;, Moscow and Leningrad, and the Soviets did not realize .that U'2s had overflown th'ese lwo cities. 30 Dcta:chment A carried out three more overflights of the Soviet Union during the 10-day period authorized by the President.

The third mission (2023), on the following day, included the Crimean Peinsula. 31 The film from the first 9verflight (4 July) was flown to lhe United States immediately after the U-2 landed at Wiesbaden. Several members of the Photq Intelligence Division were on hand when the film was developed to check on the results. Als9 present was James Baker, who had accepted an offer by project officials to get a first­ hand look at how the new A-2 lenses were working." The photos from July overflights were generally good, i:lespite · occasional problems caused by .cloud cover. The huge amount of film taken by these missions provided more information about the Soviet Union's ability to track and intercept U-2s. Photointerpreters examin­ ing the films eventually discovered the tiny 'images of MiG-15s and MiG-17s beneath the U-2s in various pursuit and attack attitudes: climqing, flipping over, and falling toward Earth. It was even possible to determine their approximate altitudes. These photographs showed that the Soviet air defense system was able· to track U-2s well enough to attempt interception, but they also provided proof that the fighter aircraft available to the Soviet Union in 1956 could not bring down a U-2 at operational altitude." One probiem with early U-2 photography .became apparent only afler the first films were developed. If there was surface water on the runway at Wiesbaden when the U-2 took off, the camera windows be­ came begrimed. Although the water dried during the Hight, the oily. scum it left behind degraded the photographic image. To combat this problem, AQUATONE ground crews took brooms and spent several hours before takeoff sweeping puddles of water from the runway to be used by the U-2. Kelly Johnson eventually designed a jettisonable cover for the camera' windows, which was released at the same tiine . as the pogos so that it could be recovered and reused."

The note said that the overflights had been made by a "twin-engine medium bomber of the United States Air Force" and gave details of the routes flown by the first two missions. The note did not mention Moscow or Leningrad, however, because the Soviets had not been able to track these portions of the overflights. The Soviet note stated that the ftights could only be evaluated as "inten­ tional and conducted for the purposes.of intelligence." As soon as the note arrived at the White House on the evening of 10 July 1956, Colonel Goodpaster called Bissell and told him to stop all U-2 over­ flights until further notice. The next morning Goodpaster met with Bissell to review the U-2 situation. Bissell said three additional flights ·had taken place since the missions mentioned in the Soviet note but added that no more were planned.'·' Later Eisenhower told G0odpaster that he "didn't lik<; a thing" about the Soviet note and was going to discuss the matter with Secretary of State Dulles. With the strong approval of President Eisenhower, Goodpaster informed.DC! Dulles that "tl1ere is to be no mention of the existence of this project or of operations incident to it, outside the Executive Branch, and no 111ention within the Executive Branch to others than those who diretlly need to know of the opera­ . tion, as distinguished from output deriving from it."" During these initial overflights, the U-2 tlew above 69,000 feet and could be seen only fleetingly by pilots of the Soviet interceptor aircraft. Thus, it appears that the Soviet clahn that the intruder was a ·twin-engine bomber was probably based on the assumption that this was another overftight by a reconnaissance version of the twin-engine Canberra bomber, similar to the RAF overflight of Kapustin Yar in · 1953. The US reply, sent to the Soviets on 19 July, truthfully denied that any US "military planes" had overflown the Soviet Union on the days in question..

This was followed by a protest note from the Czechoslovak Government on 21 July. No fonnal reply was sent to the two Soviet satellite states.37 The details of the flightpaths listed in the Soviet and Polish pro­ tests, along with the subsequent photographic evidence of Soviet in­ terception attempts, made it clear.that U-2s could not fly undetected over the Soviet Union or Eastern Europe and could even be tracked for extended periods of time. This news greatly disturbed President Eisenhower. In a meeting with Allen Dulles on 19 'July 1956, the President recalled how he had been told that "not over a very minor percentage of these (flights) wciuld be picked up." He went on to question "how far this should now be pushed, knowing that detection is not likely to be avoided." After discussing the possibility of basing U-2s in the Far East, President Eisenhower went on to say that lie had "lost enthusiasm" for the U-2 activity. He noted that, if the United States were on the receiving end of a Soviet overflight operation, "the reaction would be drastic." The President was also concerned that the American public might learn of the overflights and be shocked that their counu-y had violated international law. He stated, "Soviet pro­ tests were one thing, ·any loss of confidence by our own people would .38 ' be quite another." The President's rapid disenchanunent with the project was not lost on Richard Bissell. Fearing for the U-2 program's survival, he met with the Land committee in early August J956 to urge them to help make the U-2 less vulnerable. to radar pulses. His goal was to reduce the aircraft's radar cross section so that it would be less sus­ ceptible to detection. Edward Purcell had some ideas on 'this and sug­ gested that he supervise a new project in the Boston area to explore them. At the direction of the Land committee, Bissell set in motio~ a project known as HTNAMABLE to establish a proprietary finn called the Scientific Engineering Institute (SE!) in Cambridge. Former Air Force Col. Richard S. Leghorn· headed the SE! operation for the Agency when it began on 26 November 1956. SE! was staffed by sev­ eral MIT scholars who conducted studies and experi~ents into n "Alkged Violalions ofSoviet Teni1ory: Soviet Note of July 10, 1956 with U.S. Repty," US Department of State Bulletin, 30 Ju{y 1956, pp. 191-192; OSA History, chap. 11, pp. 32-33 ¢Codeword), 31 Andrew J.

THE END OF THE BOMBER GAP During the three-week period of 20 June to IO July 1956, U-2s had made eight overflights beyond the Iron Curtain, including five over the Soviet Union. PID's photointerpreters were busy until the end of August with their initial evaluation of the photography obtained by these flights. Their efforts were complicated by the division's move on 9 July from Que Building to the Steuart Building, but, when the photointerpreters were finished, they were able to write "finis" to the controversy over Soviet bomber strength. Although tl1e Air Force had claimed that the Soviet Union pos­ 8essed almost lOO oft.he new Myasishchev-4 (Bison) heavy bombers, U-2 photography proved this assertion .wrong. There were no Bison· bombers at any of the nine long-range bomber bases photographed by the July missions. DC! Allen Dulles was particularly impressed by the photographs of the Soviet bomber bases, which in later years he . called "million-dollar" photography. The actual value of the U-2 photos was probably even greater because, on the strength of their ev­ idence, the White House was able to deny Air Force requests for ad­ ditional B-52 bombers to "catch up" ro the Soviets." Because of the need to protect the source of the information. about Soviet bomber strength, the controversy surrounding this issue did not immediately die down. Tn November 1956, when the CIA began providing new Biso-n production figures based on U-2 photog~ raphy without identifying the source, sorne ,1nembers of Congress­ unaware of the existence of the U-2-questioned the motivation be­ hind ti1e reduced estimates. They suggested that either the earlier es­ timates of Soviet bomber strength 'had been inflated to increase Air Force appropriations or tl1e new estimates had been reduced by White House direction in order to hold down military expenditures. ;\') Records of Scientific Engineering Ins!ilute (Project HTNAMABLE), OSA records (Ji( Codeword).

The.need to keep the existence of the U-2 program secret caused problems even within· the CIA itself. The Office of Security sharply restricted the number of persons who cciuld be cleared for access Lo U-2 photography. The special clearance was granted on a "slot" ba­ · I i I I I .

The U-2 photographs were kept in a secure room, and only those with special clearances were admitted to the room. Jn addition, the Office of Security considered U·2 information too sensitive to use in CIA publications. As a result, many analysts did not have access to information that would have greatly aided the production of intelligence estiinatC:s. 42 · Seeret TACTICAL INTELLIGENCE FROM U-2s DURING THE SUEZ CRISIS Although U-2s had ceased flying over the Soviet Bloc because of . President Eisenhower's standdown order, they could still be used elsewhere in the world. The Middle East would be the next area for U-2 operations. On 26 July 1956, Egyptian President Gama! Abdel Nasser nationalized the Suez Canal Company in retaliation for the .de­ cision by the United States and the United Kingdom to withdraw fi­ nancial support for the Aswan Dam project. Nasser's action provoked m1 international crisis that would have a permanent effect on the U-2 program. Long before the Suez Crisis developed, the CIA had planned to deploy U-2s in Turkey for use in the Soviet overflight program. On 1 May 1956, US Charged' Affab·cs Foy D. Kohler approached Turkish . · Prime Minister Adnan Menderes on this matter. He told the Prime Minister that the effort was a continuatio.n of the GENETRJX pro­ gram, during which balloons had been released from Turkey, and in­ volved aircraft that could fly 10,000 feet higher than any Soviet plane. Menderes gave his approval immediately.

Detachment A was. therefore, assigned the first Middle East overflights. On 29 August, U-2 missions 1104 and 1105 left Wiesbaden and overflew the eastern Mediterranean littoral, starting -with Greece, then Egypt, Israel, Lebanon, Syria, and· Turkey. Because these target areas were beyond the round trip range of the Wiesbaden-based U-2s, the planes landed at Adana for refueling. The next day, the same two planes, with dif­ ferent pilots, took off from Adana and overflew the same Middle East territory, this tin1e including ~he Gaza Strip, before returning to Wiesbaden. The film contained evidence of large numbers of British troops on Malta and Cyprus and nlore new French-made aircraft in Israel than had previously_ been reported."' As the situation around Suez grew 1nore .tense, the Eisenhower administration decided to release some of the U-2 photos to the British Government. On 7 September, James Reber, chairman of the Ad ffoc Requirements Committee, and Arthur Lundahl, chief of the Photo Intelligence" Division, flew to London, taking with them photos . of the e_astern Mediterranean area, including the ·suez Canal, taken on 30 August. These were the first and the only phqtos· of the _Middle East that the President authorized to be given to U1e British during the 1956 crisis." The Eisenhower adtninisiration viewed the develop1nents .in the ·eastern Mediterranean with great concern. To keep the President and Secretary of State abreast of developments in the area, Deputy Director for Intelligence Robert Amory established on 12 September a multiagency group known as the- PARAMOUNT Committee to monitor the situation on.a round-the-clock basis. The PARAMOUNT Committee worked inside PID headquarters in the Steuart Building. Composed of members fro~ CIA, State; NSA, Anny, Navy, and A_ir Poree, this committee met daily-frequently several times a day-to produce reports based on informat',on ohtained frotl) U-2 photogra­ phy, communications and electronic iiite!ligence, and. agents.

Before this crisis, the U-2 had been seen solely as a collector of strategic intelligence, with high-quality results considered more important than speed. U-2 film had, therefore, been returned to the 1nanufacturer for optimun1 develop1nent and then interpreted in Washington using the most up-to-date devices. Now, because of the Middle East crisis, Project AQUATONE was expected to perform like a tactical reconnaissance unit, developing film immediately after landing for instant interpretation or "readout." Photo-Intelligence Division personnel assigned to Project HTAUTOMAT (U-2 filni ex­ ploitation), therefore, had to arrange for forward processing of the U-2 film to avoid unacceptable delays in· providing intelligence on tactical developments around Suez. PID acted quickly to carry out its new assiglline~t. Lundahl and Reber ftew from the United Kingdom to US Air Force Europe head­ quarters in Wiesbaden on 12 September to make arrangements for processing and interpreting U-2 film in West Germany. They had been preceded by chief of PID's Special Projects Branch. Following detailed discussions with Air Force photo­ inte1ligence personnel, the CIA representatives arranged to· use a por­ tion of a nearby Air Force photo laboratory for deve!Oping U-2 film. With the assistance of I Ichief of the HTAUTOMAT photo laboratory, and Air Force personnel,,! Ihad .the lab ready for processing on the following day, when the next U-2 mission returned from the Middle East. After quickly developing the film," I land his joint staff of CIA and armed forces personn~l stud­ ied it fa~ indications of British and French preparations for hostilities and sent their first report to Washington on 15 September. . Altho,gh 1: Airl Force provided considerable assistance in es­ tab]_ishing photo laboratory, Air Force officials did not like the idea o 1 1A personner 2ontro1ling overseas photo proce'Ssing and interpretation centers, which were normally under Air Force con­ trol. Further negotiations led to a CIA-Air Force agreement at the end of October, under which the Air Force would name the commanding officer for such installations and the. CIA would designate tlie deputy, who was responsible for technical and intelligence matters." PID soon added two photointerprcters and a lab technician to the West German operation, which continued to dev.elop and interpret U-2 photography of the Middle East throughout September and " [bid., pp. 49-52 <Jl· Seeret SECRET 11 C01462740 aeGR.eT Seeret NOFORN Chapter 3 116 Octo)Jer 1956. This unit's timely and. accurate information enabled the PARAMOUNT Committee to predict the joint Israeli-British-French attack on Egypt three days before it took place. On 11 September, Detachment A pilot Jacob Kratt overflew the French Mediterranean naval base at Toulon. He brought back imagery revealing that France was loading troopships at Toulon. During the rest of the month, Detachment A pilots flew another eight missions over the Middle East. By this time, the new Detachment B in Turkey wac;; ready for operations, and it was better positioned to provide cov­ erage of the Middle East. Detachment B began flying missions in September and soon became the p1imary detachment for Middle East . overflights, conducting nin.e out of the IO such missions flown in October." 8 Detachment B's first U-2 flight, on 11 September 1956, made passes over Turkey, Cyprus, and Rhodes. The next flight, more than two weeks later, covered much the same ground but flew as far" west as Malta, Sicily, and Crete. Both were "special" missions aimed at maintaining surveillance of the British and French fleets and forces as they prepared for the attack on Egypt. Meanwhile, Detachment A pi­ lots flew four missions in the Western Meditertanean. During thi.s period, the PARAMOUNT Committee's photo­ interpreters developed the new science of "tent-ology"...,,counting the tents of British forces on the islands of Cyprus and Malta to deter­ mine the number of troops ·deployed. The photointerpreters used changes in the number of tents to determine that the British forces were beginning to move toward the beaches, where. they were eventu­ ally lightered to offshore troopships." Noting the U-2 activity in the Middle East, President Eisenhower wrote in his diary on· 15 October 1956: "Our high-ftying reconnais­ s_ance planes have shown that Israel has obtained some 60 of the French Mystere pursuit planes, when there had been reported· the transfer of only 24."

The Anglo-Fren~h military buildup greatly irritated President Eisenhower, who consid­ ered these activities a violation of the 1950 Tripartite Declaration; iri which the United States, the United Kingdom, and France had agreed to maintain the status quo in armaments and borders in the MiddI.e East. To Arthur Lundahl he remarked, "It's a hell of a note when you have to G-2 your friends." 51 • · · · U-2 photography continued to keep the President and other key officials well informed about the progress of the crisis. Flights ovet Israel and Rhodes on 21 October and Cyprus on 25 October revealed. heavy military concenu·ations and an increase in \he number of troop transports and air forces. On the basis of this infonnation, Secretaiy of State John Foster Dulles told the President on 28 October that he believed an Israeli attack on Jordan was imminent, adding that tie. thought the British and Frencli would take advantage of such an at­ tack to occupy the Suez Canal." The i'o-day Middle East war began on the afternoon of 29 October J 956 with Israeli paratroop drops in the Sinai peninsula, fell: lowed by mobile columns striking deep into Egyptian territory. The next day, 30 October, Francis Gary Powers conducted mission 1314.

The United Kingdom and France entered the fray on tlie evenirtg of 3i October with bombing raids against major Egyptian airfield1:. The Anglo-French bombing campaign continued for the next 4~'. hours. Early on the morning of 1 November, an Adana-based U-2~ pi­ loted by William Hall, took off to gather intelligence o~ ·the Anglo-French milita;y activity. After photographing Cyprus, H~ll flew south to the Sinai Desert, where he made several passes to obt.ain complete coverage of the Israeli-Egyptian fighting there.

The 1 November mission over Cyprus and Egypt also photo­ graphed Anglo-French preparations to invade Egypt. President Eisenhower was infonned of this in1pcnding jnvasion on Sunday, 4 November. On the followiug day, British and French paratroopers dropped near Port Said at tl1e nortl1 end of the Suez Canal.

Back in Washington President Eisenhower met with Allen Dulles to discuss the deepening international criSis. Worriecr that the Soviet Union rnight be poised to intervene in the war, the Preside1i.t ordered Dulles to have the Adana-based U-2s fly over Syria to see whether the Soviets were nloving planes to Syrian airbasef; in preparation for a strike against the forces attacking Egypt. The answer to Eisenhower's question ca1ne n1uch sooner than expected because on the previous day a U-2 had already overflown Syria before making a run across northern Egypt. The ·mm from this flight had reached Wiesbaden for processing and readout during the night. The results were in the hands of the PARAMOUNT Committee by midmorning on 6 November, while the President was motoring to Gettyshurg to cast his ballot. By the time the Presillcnt returned to the White House by l1elicopter at noon, Colonel Goodpaster was waiting for him witl1 an ans\ver: there were no Soviet aircraft in Syria. Because of the President's concern about possible Soviet moves, Syria was the target of 14 additionul U-2 flights belween 7 Noven1ber and 18 December 1956."

President Eisent1ower had halted all such overflights by his order of ·JO July, and, in the 1nonlhs that followed, he remained unconvinced by CIA arguments in favor of n resumption of"overflighrs.

A little 1uore than tv.10 weeks later, on 3 October, when the President again met with Bissell, Cabell, and Radford, John Foster Dulles was also present ln opening the meeting, Eisenhower said he had become discouraged regarding Project AQUATONE.

Before the prograrp started, Richard Bissell had estimated that the U-2 would be able to fly oyer the' Soviet Union with impunity for only about two Y.ears. This period was already over,·· . and the Soviets were \vorking franlicaJly lo devise .a 111eans to stop U-2 overflights. From the very beginning, Soviet air defense units had not only tracked U-2s with radars, but had also made repeated efforts lo shoot the1n down with antiaircraft 1,veapons and interceptor aircrafl. ln I 956 such aLten1pted interceptions had involved pri1narily MiG- 1Ss and MiG-17s. which could barely reach 55,000 feet. The advent of MiG-19s and MiG-ils, which could climb even higber; provided a greater threat for U-2 pilots. · Realistic.training for pilots learning to intercepL the Y-2 becan1e · possible al'ter the Soviets developed a new high-altirude aircraft, the· Mandrake, which was actually an improved version of the Yakovlev-25 ail-weather interceptor. Thi.! Mandrake used a J1igh-lift, low-drag wing design similar to tlrnl employed by the U-2; but its l\Vin t!ngines inadc it heavier. The Mandrake's Operating altitude was 55,000 to 65,000 feet, and its maximum altitud~ was 69,000, far less than t.hc 75,000 feet reached by the U-2. Like. the U-2, Ute Mandrake's wings woUld iiot toleracc great srreSl:ies, so it could not be used us an nrtack aircrafl at the high altitudes at which hoth planes. operated. Between 1.957 and 1959, Yakovlev built l5 to 20 of these aircraft in two versions:- the Mantlrnke-R or YAK-25RM and the Mandrake-T, sometimes c.-illed Ute YAK-26. These high-altiuide air~ craft were used to overfly the Middle East, India, China, .and Pnkislan, as well as border regions of NATO nations in Europe during the la(e 1950s and early 1960s. It is not believed tba! Mandrakes ever attempted to overfly lhe continental United States."'

Depart111ent officials on GMay 1957, President Eisenhower approved the concept' of British participation in the U-2 . - . pro,1ect. During the next six months, Dulles anil Bissell met with Sir Dick White, head of· Ml-6, and Air Vice Marshal William M. L.

As the 1nissile-gap controversy raged, Prt1sident Eisenhower stuck to his refusal to permit overflights of the Soviet Union, al­ though the Sovicr Union's resumption of lCBM testing almost_per­ sumled. him to change his mind.

After Llte trip was over, Khrnshchev and other leading Soviet officials continued t:o make ex­ aggerated clain\S ;.\bout the extent of their 1nissile force, adding to the confusion and concern within tl1e US intelligence co1nn1u11ity. 'fhus in November 1959, Soviet Premier Khrushchev tcild a .conference of jou,rnalists, "Now we have such a-stock· of rockets, such an a1nount of atomic anti hydrogen weapons, thnt if they attack US, we cmild wipe our potential enemies off the face of the earth." He then added that "in one year. 250 rockets with hydrogen warheads came off the as­ sclubly line in the factory \Ve visilcd.'' 12 Because the Soviet Union ha<l been launching at least one 1nissile per week since early fall, US policy1nakers placed great weight on his re1nnrks. Despite the inteJligencc con1111unity's intense iuteresr in the Soviet Union's nuclear and 1nissi]e progran1s, President Eisenhower <lid not authorize any n1ore overflights of tl].e Soviet Union during rhe ren1ninder of the year. On tl1e other hand, he raised no objections to (and probably welcomed) the first Dritish ovetflight of the Soviet Union in December 1959. For almost a year, the RAF pilots of Delachmenl D had been ready to fly over the Soviet Union, but Prime Minister Harold Macmillan had not 1xeviously authorized any such missions bccnuse of llis own visit to the Soviet Union, severaJ interna­ tional n1eetings, and other state visits. As a result, British U-2 n1is­ sjons had been confined to the Middle East. Now that the Prime Minister's approval had been ob~1ined, Detachment B conducted Operation HIGH WIRE with an RAF pilot. Squadron leader Robert Robinson left Peshawar on 6 December and overflew Kuybyshev, Sm·atov Engels Airfield, and the Kapustin · Yar Missile Test Range before landing al Adana. The mission photography was excellent, but it did not provide intelligence on Soviet ICBMs, which were ,tested at Tyuratan1, not Kapustin Yar. 13 Because there had been so few ovei'rlighls in 1958 and 1959, ,niany questions about the Soviet 1nissile progran1 remained unan­ S\vered.

At a meeting of the board on 2 February 1960, Gen. James Doolittle urged President Eisenhower to use overflights ur rt1e Soviet Union to the maximum degree possible. The President's response, as summarized in General Goodpaster's notes of the meeting, showed that the upcoming summit meeting was already an important factor in . his attitude toward U-2 flig!lts: "The President said that he has one tr_e1nendous asset in a sum1nit 1neeting, as Fegards effect in the free world. That is his reputation for honesty. If one of these aircraft were lost when we arc. engaged in apparently sincere delibcratlons 1 it could be put on display in Moscow and ruin the President's effectiveness." 1 ' A few clays later, another U-2 took to the sky ori a mission over· the Soviet Union. As in Deceinber, the pilot was British, and the n1is­ sion hml been ordered by Prime Minister Macmillan. On 5 February 1960, a Detachment B U-2C with squadron leader John MacArthur at the controls lefl Peshawar, Pakistan, to conduct Operation KNIFE EDGE. The plane overffcw the 'lyurntam Missile Test Range, headed northwest lo Kazan', and then turned south,, photographing long stretches of the Soviet mil nelwork. Tl1c excellent photography from this n1ission ditl not reveal a single n1issile site, but analyst's did tlis­ cover a new Soviet bomber, dubbed the BACKFIN, at Kaza11'." Despite the outcome of this mission, lhe missile-gap debate con­ tinued. The Air Force still insisted tlrnt the Soviets had deployed as mimy as 100 missiles. The Army, Navy, and CIA, 110Wever, doubted thal any had been deployed, because none could be found. Addilional U-2 photography was needed lo settle the debate. In mid-Febnmry, President Eisenhower reviewed plans for four additional U-2 mis­ sions. 1'he success of the two British ~nissions, along with the abseJj~ of Soviet protestS, made the President 111ore willing to. consider a/re­ sumption of US overllights, and he agreed to allow one mission to be HQwn during the tnonth of March.

Because of complications in getting permission from Pakistan to use the airfield at Peshawar, however, the mission conld not be staged in March, and the President agreed to extend his deadline until IO April 1960. One. day before the expiration of this deadline, a U-2 equipped with a B-camera took off from P"shawar on the last successful overflight of the Soviet Union, Operntion SQUARE DEAL. As had been the case during the previous two overflights, a second U-2 flew a diversionary 111ission along th'e Soviet-Iranian bbrder. After leaving Peshawar, 111is­ sion 4155 headed firsl for Saryshagan, where it ·obtained the first pic­ tures of two new Soviet radars, tl1e HEN HOUSE and HEN ROOST installations. The U-2 then flew to the nuclear testing site at Sc1nipalatinsk. Returning to Lhe S(\1-yfihagan area, it crisscrossed the railroad network there and then proceeded to Tyurntam, where it pho­ tographed u new two-pact, road-served launch area that suggested a (, new Soviet missil~ was in the offing. 111 In his memoirs Nikita Khrushchev remarked that this U-2 should hUvc been shot down: "but our an1iaircraft batteries were caught nap· ping and didn't open fire soon enough." Khmshchev explained that Soviet missile designers had developed u high-altitude antiaircraft missile ·and butteries of this missile hacl been deployed near known targets of the U-2." The CIA alreacly had strong indications ol' improvements in the Soviet air defense system, and early in 1960 the Development Projects Division had asked Air Force experts at the Air Technical lnre!ligence Center (ATIC) for a· frank assessment of Sovie! capabili­ ties against the U-2. On 14 March 1960, Col. William Burke, acting chief of the DPD, relayed the AT!C assessment to Richard 1\issell: The greatest threat to the U-2 is the Soviet SAM. Although the ATIC analysis concedes a remote possibility that the SAM may be less effective than e.sti1nated, their present evaluation is that the SAM (Guideline) has a high prnbability of rnccessful inter­ cept at 70,000 feet providing that detection is made in sufficieitl titne to alert the site. 10 " Mission f~lder 4155, 9 April 1960, OSA records, job 67·B·32R, hox 6 O:S-Codc.word). 1 ~ Nikita S.

Colonel Burke's 14 March letter recommentling SQUARE DEAL as the prefcrrccl rouce fcir the next overflight hacl stnted, "There is a rea­ sonable chance of co1npleling Lhis operntion without detection." Escaping detection had becorne in1poftanl because, if th'e .Soviel SAMS received sufficient advanc~c.J warning, they posed a 1najor tbreat lo the U-2. CIA hopes that flighls fro1n Pukistan or Afghanistan 1night go untletected proved false. On U1e ·9 April overflight, the U-2:s EUN'l'collection unit (System VJ) indicated Soviet tracking al a \•ery early stage of the mission. Although the Soviets failed to intercept the U-2, their success at tracking it should l1ave served as· a warning againsL future overflights fro111 Pakistan (or any\.vherc else, for that. mutter). On 26 April 1960, Colonel Burke informed Richard Bissell that· "experience gained as a result of Opcralion SQUARE DEAL indicaics that penetralion wi~hout detection ti·un1 the Pakistan/ Afghanistan are.ii 1nay not be as easy i.n the fu!ure as heretofor." '· 1 • Unfortunately, neither Colonel Burke no.r Richard Bissell took the logical step of recon1111ending Lhe cessation of overflights now that the risks had increased substantially. The lure of the prospective intel­ ligence gain fron1 each 1nission was loo strong, ·~tnd the Soviets' lack' of success at interception to date h~1d probably n1ade the project staff overconfident. Furtl1ermore, both DC.I Allen D.ulles and the President's Board ol' Consultants on Foreign Intelligence Activities were pressing for more photos of the Soviet Union in order to settle , tile 111issile-gnp debate raging in lhe int~lligence con11nunity and Congress.

One in1portant area of DDP activity during this period was Tibet. In March 1959, .the PLA suppressed an uprising against the Chinese occupation of Tibet, and several thousand Tibetans lled the country along with their spiritual lender, the Dcilai ·Laina. Afterward, Agency operatives from the DDP's Far East Division began training so111e of these Tibetan refu­ gees for p'ira1nilitary operations inside Tibet.

The Defense Dcpart1ncnt qu~ckly approved Lllis request. Before the two Air Force aircraft were placed in service. however, the Agency had them upgraded with .175/P-l 3A engines "nd various electronic de­ 52 vices, a process that took 111ore than four nlonths.

In fact, standard overhe;id photography was of litTle vcilue in detern1ining whether or nol various nuclear-related facilities were producing weapon-grade n1aterials. Such infonnation could only be obtained l'ron1 agent report~ or infrared i1naging of lhe rargct8, which would reveal the he<.it associated with nuclear-refining activity. Early in 1963 the Agency sought special funds fro1n the Penlagou to de­ velop a high-resolution infrared scannc·r for the U-2 in order lo ascer-· tain the open.uional status of Chin.esc nuclear reactors. Afte1: this request was tun~ed dowry, tlle Agency decided ~o fund the deve/op­ n1ent of such a scanner itself. In lhe spring uf 1963 1 .tl1c Office of Research anl! Development (ORD) signed a contract wilh •the ·rcxas lnslrun1cnts Corporation for the production of an infrared scanner that \Vould operal:e in lhe 0.5-inilliradian range. To conceal the intended purpose of the scanner, the devices were called ·forest fire detectors and assigned 111odel 11un1be~·s such us o:F~'.1)- l."

Further i1n­ provcmc11ts followed, and 011 26 October 1964 ORD declared the infrared unit operational. In reporling the successful re~uHs of t11c in- . frared testing to DC!

McCone i1n1nediat~ly told Chapn1an to order 1i1ore, and the Agency then pur­ chased several for Project 'I'ACKLI:;: and a stereo-configured FFD-4 for Project OXCART. DCJ McCone reviewed these inf!'ared detection clevelop1neuts wil'h Defense Secn;:lary McN<itnan1 and his new deputy, Cyrus Vance, on 30 October, being ·careful to lJoint oul that the new device was a product of Agency-sponsored R&D because the Pentagon had refused to fund it.

As in the past, the adtninistration op­ posed the use of Agency pilots for overflights of China, so the device was sent to Det~1ch1ncnt I-I on 7 Nove1nber 1964. The FFD-2 unit was installed in a U-2C in order to gather data l'ron1 a .'iuspectcd uraniun1 gaseous-diffusion plant at Lan-chou. ·It tOok fot1r tries, however. before this goal was achieved. The first at­ ten1pt, which was schedu.led to 'be staged ti·o1n Kunsan, South Korea, on 22 November 1964, had to be abandoned after the pilot became ill. A second 111ission took off three days later with another pilot. Flying at 69,000 feet; Lhc plane was tracked by radar during the entire flight and atLracted a total of five PRC fighters. When the U-2 was within I 0 miles ol' Lan-chtJU, a previously unknown SA-2 ballery launched several 1nissiles. This unexpected atlack so unnerved U1e pilot that he broke off lhc 1nission without overflying the tai"get area. Three weeks later a third n1ission to Lan-chou was abo1ted because of bad weather shorlly after the U-2 entered PRC airspace. The pilot.did not bother to return to Kun.san but ftew directly to T'ao-yuan. Finally, ·on 8 January 1965, a Delachmenl H U-2 made it all Lhc way to Lao-chou and back lo Kunsan with the infrared scanner and obtained good results. When the filtn was processed and evaluated at NP1C, analysts dctcnnincd that the gaseous-diffusion plant was indeed operaling.' 9 'l'wo days after the successful Lan-chou 1nission, the infrared unit was airborne again, this tin1c bo111.1J for Bao.tau and the air-cooled reactor located nearby. This .ftighl ended abruptly when an SA-2 1nis­ silc downed the U-2 26 miles short of the target. It was the fourth U-2 lo.~l over China. No n1ore U-2 flights over China used the infrared scanner, although a Inter 1nodel lR device was shipped to Tao Yuan and kcpl in readiness in the event it n1ight be needt!d. 1'he loss of yet another U-2 and ils pilot 111ade Nationalist Chinese officials reluctrint to resu1ne overflights of the 1nainland.

The 303 Committee (the new name for the.

These three n1i:.;sion~ turned oul tn be Lile last over(Hghls by U-2s in the Fur East. By this time lJ-2 11ights over the PRC had become so dangerous that the State Department opposed further overJlights, and on 10 April 1968 the 303 Committee decided not to approve any mission that would lly closer than 20 n1iles frorn the coast of Chjna. One reason why Detach1)1cnt H's overllighls were stopped was the steady increase in the PRC's ability to lrack and engage U-2s, as evidenced· by its success in clo.,,;ning five lJ-2s.

On 31 1)1arch 1968, the Presi.dent lilnited the bo1nbing of North Vietna1n in order ro in1prove the chances for peace talks.

CIA project offi­ cials had csti111ated that its life expectancy for Jiying safely over the Sovie! lJnion would be be.tween l8 inonths and two years. ·After ovcrflighi:s hegan and lhe Soviets demonstrated the capability of trucking and n1te1nptii1g to intercept the U~2, this esti1hate see1ned too optin1istic. By August 1956, Richard Bi!lsell was so concerned aboul the U~2's vulnerability that he despaired of its ability to avoid destruction for six rnontbs. !el alone two years. To extend the U-2's useful operational life, project officials first nltcmpted to reduce U1c aircraft's vulnerability to detection by Soviet rndarn. Project RAlNBOW's efforts to mask the radar image of (he U-2 not only proved ineffective, but actually n1ade the ai1:craft tnore vulnerable by adding extra weight that reduced its 111axinn1n1 altitude. Because Soviet radar operators t.:ontinucd to find and track U-2.s equipped with antiradar systen1s, the CIA canceled Project RAlNBOW in May 1958. Long heforc the failure ol' Project RAINBOW, Richard Bissell and his J\ir Force assistant, Col. Jack A. Gibbs, 11ad begun to look for . n 111ore n1dlcii.l solution to the prob!,en1 of Soviet radar detection-an entirely new uircrnft. In the late su1nn1er of 1956, the two officials visitc(l a t1u1nher of nirfran1e contrar..:lors in a search for new ideas. An1ong the n1orc unusual \Vas Northrop Aviation's proposal for a gi­ gantic aircral't with a very-high-lift wing. Because it woulcl not be nu1clc of 111ctnl, the \.Ying would require a type of bridge truss on its . upper side to give it rigidity. The proposed aircraft would achieve Sec1 et SECRET ----· C01462740 SE:GRET -Seet'et NOFORN Chapter 6 ---·-·---- 260 altitudes of 80,000 to 90,000 feel but only at subsonic speeds, just enough to. keep it airborne.' The slow-flying Northrop design did not solve the problem of radar detection, and in 1957 the e1npha?is switched to supersonic de­ signs. In August 1957, the Scientific Engineering Institute (SEI), a ClA proprietary firn1 that bad been working on ways to reduce the U-2's vulnerability to radar, began to investigate the possibility of designing an aircraft with a very s111all radar cross section. SEI soon discovered that supcrsoniC speed-greatly. reduced the chances of de- . tection by radar. 1 Fron1 this point on, the CIA's attention focused in­ creasingly'on the possibility of building ari aircraft that could fly at both eX.tren1ely high speeds and high altitudes while incorporating the best ideas in radar-absorbing or ra<.lar-deHecting techniques. THE EVALUATION OF DESIGNS FOR A SUCCESSOR TO THE U-2 lly the autumn of 1957, Bissell and Gibbs had collected so many ideas for a successor to the U-2 thal Bissell asked DCI Dulles for pcr­ 111issio1i to establish-an advisory con11nitret! to assist in the selection process. Bissel! aiso felt that the sLlpport of a conuuittee of pro1ninent scientists and engineers \VOttkl prove useful when it ean1e Lin1e to ask · for funding· for such an expensive project.

Early in 1958, Richai·d Bissell -asked of­ ficials I'ro111 both firn1s to sub1nit designs for a high-speed reconnais­ sance aircrafl. During the spring and stuniner of 1958, bolh finns \Vorked on deslgn concepts without gt;:ivenunent contracts or funds. Following extended discussions with Bis.sell on the subject of a supersonic successor to the U-2, Lockheed's Kelly Johnson began de­ signing an aircraft that would cruise at. tvlach 3.0 at allitudes above 90,000 l'eet. On 23 July 1958, Johnson presented his new higl1-speed concept to Land's advisory con11i1ittce, which expressed interest in the approach he was taking. Al the 1H1n1e 1neeting, Navy representatives presented a concept for a high-altitude reconnais.o;;ance vehicle that ex­ amined the possibility of developing a ramjet-powered, inflatable, rubber vehicle that would be lifted to altitude by a balloon and then be propelled by a rocket_ to a speed where the ramjers coold ·produce thrust. Richard Bissell asked Johnson to ·evaluate this Concept, and th1;ee weeks later, after receiving 1nore def.nils fro1n Navy repre­ sentatives, J(elly Johnson made so1ne quick calculatic)ns that showed thar the design was in1practical because t!1e balloon would have to be a 111ile in cJian1etcr to lift. the vehicle, which in turn would need a wing Sllrfnce area greater than one-sevcinh of an acre to can·y the payload.''

Following recorn1nendations by the Land· co1Tin1ittce. both l.ockheed and Convair incorporated the Pratt & Whili:iey J58 power plnnt into their designs. This engine had originally been developed for the N"vy's large, jet-pO\Vered flying boat, the Glenn L. Martin Co1npany's P6M Seanulster, and was the 1nost powerful engine available.

'In May J967, Vance directed that SR-7ls would as­ sun1e responsibility for Cubnn overflights by 1 July 1967 and would add re~po1lsibilily for overflights of Southeast AsiH by ·1 l)cccrnbcr 1967.

COOPERATION WITH THE AIR FORCE J'n this history, VJl1ich concentrates 011 the CTA's involve1nent in over­ head reconnaissance, it is easy to overlook the hnportant role that the US Air Force played in the U-2 and OXCART programs. From the very beginnings of the U-2 progra1n in 1954, the Agency and the Air Force were pHrLnr.!11: in advuncing the i:;tate of the art in overhead re­ connaiss<.ulcc.

The Air Force supplied the U-2's engines, at times djvcrting then1 J'ron1 othl!r high.:priority procluction lines. Perhaps rnost iinpnrtnnl nl' all, the Air Force provided pilots for the U-2s after the Agency's origjnal attc111pt to recruit. a sufficient nurnber of skill~d foreign pilots proved unsuccessful. Finally, the day-to-day operation8 of the U-2s could not have been conducted without the help of Air Force niis~ion planners, weather forecasters, and support personnel in the field dctHchn1ents.

Less than a decatle after the U-2 progra1n began, the Agency's new e1nphasis on' techniCal n1eans of.collection had brought c1buut the creation of a new science-oriented directorate, which Would ultiinatcly rival in 11uu1powcr and budget the Agency's other three directorates con1bined. The negative aspect of t~is ne\V e1npllaSis on technology is exploding costs. The Agency's first strategic reconnai~s11nce aircraft., tlle lJ-2, cUst less than .~:! 1nillion apiece. With the U-2's successor, the OXCAR1', each aircraft co.~t n1ore lhan $20 tnillion, and the c~sl" explosion bas continued witl1 each new generation of reconnillssance satellites. ~ Perhaps the greatest significance of the ClA's entry into the world of overhead reconnaissance in Dece1nber 1954 was the new na­ tional policy llull it signaled. Although US n1ilitary aircraft had fre- . quently vio!ate.d Soviet airspace.in the de.cac!e after Wor!d War JI, such sh~lllo\~-pcnetntlion overflights, c.oncenLrating priniarily on or­ dcr-of-batllc data, had been authorized and conlrolled by US field co1n111ande.rs, not by the President. In the autumn of 1954, however, President Dwig'hl' D.

Peacetin1e reconnaissance flights over the territory of a potential en­ en1y powe1: thus becan1e national policy.

Under a $5,000 t·in1e-and-1nateri­ als contract with Me!par, Tncorpon1tcd, Adkins hired a local 1nodel aircraft bu.il.der to assemble and rnoclil'y a standard Hawk-750 glider kit: and power it witll a rcar-n1ounted engine ·and pusher prope·ller. Fol lowing a series ol' succes~!'ul test nights, Adkins installed a s111nll ca1nera and toOk a 11u111ber of aerial photographs. By this time the effort w build a "Miniature Multi-Purpose Airborne Vehicle" had become known as Project AXILLARY. l\~clpar, l'nc.,-rece.ived u ::;;econrl contract for $50,000 to install ORD 1s autopilol in lhe aircraft, and the project nu111-agers no\\i began search­ ing for a use for their vch.icle.

Tn 1971 the Office of Special Activities evaluated 1.\.XILLARY flight-testing and detern1i11ed rllat !he sn1all n1odel air-. craft \vas not suitable for use as a covert reconnai.ss:incc vehicle be­ cause of its large radar cross section and significant accoustical ,o.;ign:.1ture. ~flle aircraft's radar signature 1nade it potentially useful as a weapons syste111s? however. ORD suggested r.hat AXILLARY be equipped with n radar-hon1ing unit and a s1nall \.varhead, which \.Yould n1akc it an inexpensive n1eans for destroying the radar~ cn1ploycd by surface-to-air 1nissile sysren1s in Nl?fth Victnarn.

As I Bet out to fulfill that tasking it soon became clear that In order to asse88 the validity and practicality of the proces8 I needed to do enough supporting research and analysis to fully understana how and the process works Frankly , sir that proved to be an extremely involved and difficult business_ Initially, based on conversations with a phyeician who took the Gateway training wlth me , I had recourse to the biomedical models developed by Itzhak Bentov to obtain information concerning the physical aspecls of the process _ 'Then I found it necossary to delve into various sources for information concerning quantum mechanics in order to be able to describe the nature and functioning of human consciousness _ I had to be able to construct a scientifically valid and reasonably lucid model Of how consciousness functions under the Influence of the brain hemisphere synchronization technique employed by Gateway _ Once this was done . the next step involved recourse to theoretical physics in order to explain the character of the time-space dimension and the means by which expanded human consciousness trangcends it in achieving Gateway s objectives _ Finallyh I again found it necessary to use physics to bring the whole phenonenon of out-of-body states into the language of physical science to remove the stigma of its occult connotations, and put it in a frame of reference buited to objective assessment 2 I began the narrative by briefly profiling the fundamental biomedical factors affecting such related techniques as hypnosis , biofeedback ana transcendental meditation s0 that their objectives and mode of functioning coula be compared in the reader S mind with the Gateway experience a5 the model of its underlying mechanice was developed _ Additionally, that introductory material is useful in supporting the conclusions of the paper_ I indicate that at times these related techniques may provide useful entry points to accelerate movement into the Gateway Experience _ 3 Niels Bohr the renowned physicist once responded to his son S complaints about the obtuse nature of certain concepts in physics by saying: "You are not thinking, you are merely being logical. The physics of altered human consciousness deals with some conceptualizations that are not easily gragped Or visualized exclusively in the context of ordinary "left brain" linear thinking So , to borrow Dr _ Bohr "- S mode of expression, parts of this paper will require not logic but a touch of On file ARMY releaseAnstaltiq1e #Rnlyse 2003/09/10 CIA-RDP96-00788R001700210016-5 AML STATES why only Approved For Release 2003/09/10 CIA-RDP96-00788R0O1700210016-5 right brain Intuitive insight to achieve a complete comfortable grasp of the conceptg involved_ Nevertheless , once that is done , I am confident that their construction and application will stana up to the test of rational critique 4 _ Paradoxically, having gone to great lengths to avoid trying to render judgements based on an occult or dogmatic frame of reference in the end I found it necessary to return, at least briefly, to the question of the impact of the Gateway Experience on common belief systems _ I aia s0 because although it was essential to avoid attempting to render an asge8gment in the context of such systems I felt that it was necessary after having completed the analysis to point out that the resulting conclusions do not do any violence to the fundamental mainstream of either eastern or western belief systems _ Unless that point i5 clearly established, the danger exists that some people will reject the whole concept of the Gateway Experience in the mistaken belief that it contradicts and is therefore alien to all that they hold to be right and true 5 _ This study 18 certainly not designed to be the last word on the subject but I hope that the validity of its basic structure and of the fundamental concepts upon which it is based will make it a useful guide for other USAINSCOM personnel who are required to take the Gateway training or work with Gateway materials lotnt m M1hfe WAYND M MCDONNELL LIC , MI Commander Det 0 Approved For Release 2003/09/10 CIA-RDP96-00788R001700210016-5 such annLL Approved For Release 2003/09/10 CIA-RDP96-00788R0O1700210016-5 The Gateway Experience: Brain Hemi sphere Synchronization in perspective. 1 Introduction. In order to describe the Monroe Institute technique for achieving alterea states of consciousness( the "Gateway Experience") involving brain hemi sphere synchronization or "Hemi-Sync" the most effective to begin is to briefly profile the basic mechanics which underlay operation of related methods as hypnosis , transcendental meditation, and biofeedback_ It is easiest to effectively describe what Gateway is by beginning With a short description of those associated techniques that share some common aspects with the Gateway Experience but which are nevertheless different_ In this way we can develop a frame of reference at the outset which will provide useful concepts to and understand Gateway by comparison , as we proceed . 2 Hypnosis: According to the theories of pSychologist Ronald Stone and the biomedical engineering models of Itshak Bentov hypnosis 15 basically a technique which permits acquisition of direct access to the sensory motor cortex and pleasure centers , ana lower cerebral (emotional) portions(and associated pleasure centers) Of the right side of the human brain following successful disengagement of the Stimulus screening function Of the left hemi sphere of the brain_ The left hemisphere of the brain 1s the self-cognitive, verbal and linear reasoning component of the mind . It fulfills the function of screening incoming stimuli by categorizing _ assessing and assigning meaning to allowing passage to the right hemisphere Of the mind _ The right hemisphere, which functions as the noncritical_ holistic , nonverbal and pattern-oriented component of the brain appears to accept what the left hemisphere passes to it without question_ Consequently, if the left hemi sphere can be distracted either through boredom or through reduction to a soporific, semi-sleep state, external stimuli to include hypnotic suggestions are allowed to unchallenged into the right hemi- sphere where are accepted and acted upon directly. The result may involve an emotional reaction originating in the lower cerebral region, sensory/motor re sponses requiring involvement Of the cortex, ana so on Both the sensory and the motor cortices of the right cerebral portion of the brain contain a sequence of points known as the II homunculus" which corre sponds to points in the body ( see Exhibit 1, next page) Stimulation of the corresponding area on the cortex causes intermediate response in the associated portion of the body _ Consequently, induction of the suggestion that the left is numb _ if it reaches the right hemisphere unchallenged and is referrea to the appropriate area Of the sensory cortex, will result in an electrical reaction being generated that will induce the feeling of numbness _ Similarly, the suggestion that the person 1s experiencing a general feeling of happiness and we11 being woula be referred to the appropriate pleasure centers located in the lower cerebral portion or in the cortex of the right hemisphere , thereby inducing the suggested feeling of euphoria Finally, suggestions as one that informs the hypnotic subject that he enjoys enhanced concentration or powers of memory woula be responded to in the right hemisphere by accessing unused information storage capacity normally held in reserve as a result of left hemisphere selection and control processes_ This aspect will become significant in the context of the Gateway process when attention is to examining the way that hypnosis may be used to accelerate progress in the early stages of the Gateway Experience. 3 _ Transcendental Meditation On the other hand, transcendental meditation works in a distinctly different Tashion_ In this technique, intense and protracted single minded concentration on the process of drawing energy up the cord ultimately results in what appears to be creation of acoustical standing waves in the cerebral ventricles which are then conducted to the gray matter in the cerebral Approved For Release 2003/09/10 CIA-RDP96-00788R001700210016-5 way such explain prior pass they leg such given spinal Approved For ReleaBee2a03/9t1AndIAhRDp96grb8R0O1700210016-5 SYm SENs@ry Cu"a 06 06 HONUNCULU: Kice ^rlc 9' 4 Gray PLenusure uPs stimulus TIArGR SOLOES Lvop # iNtra- Nrieitannciild XNd Raiitivuty Mq dorinal "43 Huma Cin+ahnl Cohtlk: THiad and LAtGRal nontfcigs Ahiilm #miysa Figure A The Homunculus LeregaL_Vexl _ HoToR CORTSX SeNsory Goktex THiRd Ventricle_ LATeRaL Vcntrighes Frovta Lou Figure B The Motor and Sensory Cortex and the Third and Lateral Ventricles Centrul sulcus Cortex) ZPrecentral gyrus (motor?_ Posteentral gyrus (sensory) (Sensory Cortex) (Motor Anterior horn of Body und luteral ventriclc_ posterior horn of Inter- lateral ventricle ventricular toramen 'Lateral gulcug Third ventricle Inferior horn Fourth ventricle of lateral ventricle Cerebral aqueduct/ Median aperture Lateral gperture C A view 0f the third and Lateral Ventricles in context of' Associated Brain Figure Structure For Release 2003/09/10 CIA-RDP96-00788R001700210016-5 EXHIBIT 1 ApprovedecoR Stalking the Wild Pendulu Chusgs Matter PtomS Ghay L 1 iattgr 1 0 1 rjov 1 Approved For Release 2003/09/10 CIA-RDP96-00788R001700210016-5 cortex on the right side of the brain_ As a result, according to Bentov, these waves "will stimulate and eventually 'polarize" the cortex in such a way that it will tend to conduct a Signal along the homunculus, starting from the toes ana on II The Bentov bio-medical model, as described in a book by Lee Sannella, M.D. , up entitled: Kundalini-Psychosis or Transcendence, states that the standing acoustical waves are the result Of the alterea rhythm of heart sounds which are occasioned by prolonged practice of meditation, and which set up sympathetic vibrations in the walls of the fluid filled cavities which comprise the third and lateral ventricles of the brain_ In addition, according to Bentov: "The states Of bliss described by those whose Kundalini symptoms have completed the full along the hemispheres may be explained as a self-stimulation Of the pleasure centers in the brain caused by the circulation of a 'current along the sensory cortex Bentov also notes , "that most of the described symptoms start on the left side of the body means that it is mostly a development occur ring in the right hemisphere _ Although normally a period of meditation invol- intense concentration and practice for five years or some 15 required to "bring up the Kundalini II Bentov states that exposure to mechanical or acoustical vibrations in the range of 4-7 Hertz(cycles per second) for protracted periods may achieve the same effect. Bentov cites as an example It repeated riding in a car whose suspension and seat combination produce that range of vibrations, or being exposed for long periods of time to these frequencies caused, for instance, by an air conditioning duct." He also notes that: "The cumulative effect of these vibrations may be able to trigger a spontaneous phygio-Kundalini sequence in susceptable people who have a particularly sensitive nervous system. 4 _ Biofeedback. The third consciousness altering methodology which will be briefly describea is biofeedback_ Biofeedback is somewhat unique in that it actually employs the self-cognitive powers Of the left heni sphere to access to such areas of the right brain as the lower cerebral, motor and sensory cortices and assorted or pleasure centers _ Instead of suppressing the left hemi sphere as is done in hypnosis , or largely bypassing and ignoring it as is done in transcendental meditation, biofeedback teaches the left hemisphere first to visualize the desired result and then to recognize the feelings associated with the experience of successful right hemisphere access to the specific lower cerebral, cortex, or pleasure or other areas in the manner needed to produce the desired result. Special self-monitoring devices such as the digital thermometer are used to inform the left brain when it succeeds in keying the right hemisphere into accessing the appropriate area Once this is done, the left brain can then repeatedly instruct the right brain to reestablish the pathways involved S0 a5 to produce the same external, objective measures of success _ In this way , the pathways are strengthened and sized to such an extent that left brain consciousness is enabled to access appropriate areas in the right brain using a conscious, demand mode _ For example, if the subject wishes to increase the circulation in the left in order to speed up healing he may concentrate with his left brain on achieving that result while carefully monitoring a digital thermometer connected to the left When the concentrated effort beging to achieve success , the digital thermometer Will register an increase in the temperature of the left At that point, the subject can mentally (left brain) associate the sensations experienced with the result achieved ana can begin to emphasize, by memory recalle the same process to cause its strengthening by affirmation and repetition, In this way , can be blocked, healing can be enhanced, malignant tumors can apparently be suppressed and ultimately destroyed, the body 5 pleasure centers can be stimulated, and a variety Of specific physiological results may be achieved_ In addition, biofeedback may be used to greatly accelerate achievement of deep meditative states particularly for beginners Approved For Release 2003/09/10 TIA-RDP96-00788R001700210016-5 loop ving gain pain pain empha = leg leg. leg. pain Approved For Release 2003/09/10 CIA-RDP96-00788R001700210016-5 who have no experience in meditative techiques and whose progress in that methodology is enhanced through effective visualization and external, objective affirmation. Display of the subject'8 brainwave pattern on a cathode ray tube has proven to be a laboratory-validated means by which subjects may quickly learn to place themselves in profoundly relaxed states characterized by the sort Of quietude and singularity of mental focus associated with advanced meditation_ 5 _ Gateway and Hemi-Sync Now that we have briefly profiled the basic mechanics of the principal techniques for altering or expanding consciousness which share some Of the objectives and/or methods employed in the Gateway Experience, we may proceea to focus on what that technique actually involves _ Fundamentally, the Gateway Experience is a training system designed to bring enhanced strength, focus and coherence to the amplitude and frequency of brainwave output between the left and right hemispheres S0 as to alter consciousness, moving it outside the physical sphere 90 as to ultimately escape even the restrictions of time and space _ The participant then gains access to the various levels of intuitive knowledge which the universe offers what differentiates the Gateway Experience from forms Of meditation is its use of the Hemi-Sync technique which 15 defined in a monograph by Monroe Institute trainer Melissa Jager as, "a state of consciousness defined when the EEG patterns of both hemispheres are Simultaneously equal in amplitude and frequency _ Although Hemi-Sync seems to be rather rare and of short duration in ordinary human consciousness _ Melissa Jager states that: "Audio techniques deve loped by Bob Monroe can induce and sustain Hemi-Sync with the Institute' s basic Focus 3 tapes , She also notes that: "Studies conducted by Elmer and Alyce Greene at the Menninger Foundation have shown that a subject with 20 years of training in Zen meditation could consistently establish Hemi-Sync at will, sustaining it for over 15 minutes_ Dr _ Stuart Twemlow, a psychiatrist and a research associate of the Monroe Institute, reports that: "In our studies of the effect of the Monroe tape system on brainwaves , we have found that the tapes encourage the focusing of brain energy _ can be measured as with a lightbulb, in watts ) into a narrower and narrower frequency band This focusing of energy is not unlike the yoga concept of one pointedness , which we may translate in western terms as a single-mindedness _ Dr _ Twemlow goes on to observe that as the individual into the tapes beyond Focus 3 _ Mi there is a gradual increase in 11 brainwave size which is a measure of brain energy or power _ 6 _ Lamp VS Laser: Melissa Jager uses a metaphor to help clarify the process involved in the use of Hemi-Sync in the Gateway Experience _ She points out that the human mind in its natural state may be likened to an ordinary which expends energy in the form of both heat and light but in a chaotic, incoherent way which diffuses its energy over a wide area of rather limited depth_ On the other hand , the human mind under the discipline of Hemi-Sync acts after the fashion of a laser beam which produces a di= sciplined stream of light- The stream of energy is projected with total coherence of both frequency an amplitude such that the surface area of a laser beam contains billions of times the concentrated energy found in a similar surface area on the sun Gateway assumes that once the frequency ana amplitude of the human brain are rendered coherent, it is possible to begin accelerating both s0 that the human mind is soon resona ting at ever higher vibrational levels . The mind can then bring itself into sycronization With more sophisticated and rarified energy levels in the universe_ The mind, when operating at these increasingly rarified levels 1s assumed to be capable of processing the information thus received through the same fundamental matrix by which it makes sense of ordinary physical sensory input to achieve meaning in a cognitive context Such meaning is usually perceived visually in the form of Symbols but may also be perceived as astonishing flashes Of holistic intuition or even in the form Approved For Release 2003/09/10 CIA-RDP96-00788R001700210016-5 only (it gets lamp Approved For Release 2003/09/10 CIA-RDP96-00788R001700210016-5 of scenarios involving both visual and aural perception The mechanics which the mind exercises the consciousness function will be addressed in more detail later in this paper . 7 _ Frequency Following Response - To achieve synchronization of brain hemispheres , the Hemi-Sync technique takes advantage of a phenomenon known as the Frequency Following Response ( FFR) which means that if a subject hears a sound produced at a frequency which emulates one of those associated with the operation of the human brain, the brain will try to mimmick the same frequency pattern by adjusting its brainwave output _ Therefore, if the subject is in a fully awake state but hears sound frequencies which approximates brainwave output at the Theta level , the subject S brain will endeavor to alter its brainwave pattern from the normal Beta to the Theta level_ Since the Theta level i5 associated with sleep, the subject concerned may progress from a fully awake to a sleep state(provided that he does not consciously resist) as the brain strives to entrain its wave frequency output with the one which the person hears _ Since these brainwave frequencies are outside the spectrum of sounds which can be heard in form by the human ear, Hemi-Sync must produce them based on another phenomenon known a5 the brain' $ capacity for deducing beat" frequencies _ If the human brain is exposed to one frequency in the left ear which 1s 10 Hertz below another audible frequency played in the right ear, rather than hearing either of the two audible frequencies , the brain chooses to "hear" the difference between them , the II beat" frequency. Thus , availing itself of the FFR phenomenon , and using the technique of "beat" frequencies , the Gateway system uses Hemi-Sync and other audio techniques employing the FFR phenomenon to introduce a variety of frequencies which are played at a virtually subliminal_ marginally audible level _ The objective 1s to relax the left hemi sphere of the brain, place the physical body in a virtual sleep state, and bring the left and right hemispheres into coherence under conditions designed to promote the production of ever higher amplitude and frequency of brainwave output _ Audible ana perhaps subliminal suggestions by Bob Monroe accompany the various brainwa ve frequencies, which are sometimes rolled in together with other sounds such as sea surf to mask the sound frequencies where desireable_ In this way, Gateway endeavors to provide the subject with the tools by which he may alter his consciousness based on his Own volition over time through the repetitive use of the tapes so as to access , via intuitive means , new categories of information not available to ordinary consciousness . 8 _ Role of Resonance _ However , brain coherence through entrainment to "beat" frequencies Introducea via stereo headphones is part of the reason why the Gateway system works _ It is also designed to achieve the physical quietude characteristic of deep transcendental meditative states which brings about a complete alteration of the fundamental resonance pattern asgociated with the sound frequencies produced by the human body _ Yoga , zen transcendental meditation, if practiced long enough , will produce a change in the sound frequency with which the human heart resonates throughout the entire body . According to Bentov , this change in resonance results from elimination of what the medical profession calls I1 the bifurcation echo" s0 that the sound of the heartbeat can move synchronously up and down the circulatory system in harmonious resonance approximately seven times a second _ Bentov describes the roll played by the bifurcation echo as follows: "when the left ventricle of the heart ejects blood_ the aorta, being elastic _ balloons out just beyond the valve ana causes a pressure pulse to travel down along the aorta_ When the pressure pulse reaches the bifurcation in the lower abdomen (which 18 where the aorta forks in two to go into the legs) , f the pressure pulse rebounds and starts tra veling up the aorta_ If in the meantime the heart ejects more blood, and a new pressure 19 traveling down , these two pressure Approved For Release 2003/09/10 GIA-RDP96-00788R001700210016-5 by pure only or part pulse Approved For Release 2003/09/10 CIA-RDP96-00788R001700210016-5 points will eventually collide somewhere along the aorta and produce an interference pattern. II By placing the body in a sleeplike state, the Gateway tapes achieve the same as meditation in that it places the body in such a profoundly relaxed state that the bifurcation echo slowly fades away as the heart lessens the force and frequency with which it pushes blooa into the aorta The result 1s a regular , rhythmic Sinewave pattern of sound which echoes throughout the body and rises up into the head in sustained resonance The amplitude of this sinewave pattern, when measured with a sensitive , seismograph type instrument 1s about three times the average of the sound volume produced by the heart when it is operating normally. 9 Brain Stimulation. Bentov' s biomedical model shows that this resonance is of considerable importance since it is directly transmittea to and impacts upon the brain. The resulting vibration is received and transmitted into the brain itself via the fluid filled third left ventricles located above the brain stem. An electromagnetic pulse is then generated which stimulates the brain to raise the amplitude and frequency of brainwave output, just as Dr Twemlow observed in his research on the effects of the Hemi-Sync tapes _ Also , the brain is contained in a tight membrane called the dura which i8, in turn, cushioned by a thin layer Of fluid located between it and the skull_ As the coherent resonance produced the human heart in a state of profound relaxation reaches the fluid layer surrounding the brain, it sets up a rhythmic pattern in which the brain moves up and down approximately 0 . 005 to 0 _ 010 millimeters in a continuous pattern_ The selfreinforcing character of resonant behavior accounts for the body' s ability to sustain this movement despite the minimal level of energy involved_ In this the entire body, based on its own micromotion, functions as a tuned vibrational system which transfers energy in a range of between 6 . 8 and 7.5 Hertz into the earth'9 ionospheric cavity , which itself resonates at about 7-7.5 Hertz. Of this process , Bentov states: "This 1s occurring at a very long wavelength of about 40 ,000 Km , or just about the perimeter of the planet. In other words the signal from the movement of our bodies will travel around the world in about one seventh Of a second through the electrostatic field in which we are imbedded . Such a long wavelength knows no obstacles , and its strength does not attenuate much over large distances_ Naturally it will go through just about anything: metal_ concrete, water _ and the fields making up our bodies_ It is the ideal medium for conveying a telepathic Signal. Consequently , the Gateway process 18 designed to rather rapidly induce a state of profound calm Within the nervous system and to significantly lower blood pressure to cause the circulatory system , skeleton and all other physical organ systems to begin vibrating coherently at approximately 7-7.5 cycles per second The resulting resonance sets up a regular, repetitive sound wave which propagates in consonance with the elecrostatic field of the earth. 10 _ Energy Entrainment As the body 1s turned into a coherent oscillator vibrating in harmony with the surrounding electrostatic medium, the specific exercises included in the Gateway tapes enjoin the participant to build up the energy field surrounding his body , presumably by using energy from the earth' s field which the body is now entraining because of its ability to resonate with it_ This the body 5 energy fiela into homogeneity with its surrounding environment and promotes movement of the seat of consciousness into the surrounding environment partly in response to the fact that the two electromagnetic medians are now a single energy continuum _ Thus_ the same process which moves the brain into focused Approved For Release 2003/09/10 EA-RDP96-00788R001700210016-5 goal and by way ' puts Approved For Release 2003/09/10 CIA-RDP96-00788R001700210016-5 coherence at steadily higher levels of frequency and amplitude s0 as to entrain ana lgous frequencies in the universe for data collection also promotes enhancement of bodily energy levels to a point adequate to permit the subject to experience an out-of-body movement when he is ready to do so(more will be saia about this topic later) In addition, by resonating With the earth s electromagnetic sphere the human body creates a surprisingly powerful carrier wave to assist the mina in communication activity with other human minds Similarly tuned_ 11_ Consciousness and_Energy Before our explanation can proceed any further, it is essential to define the mechanism by which the human mind exercises the function known as consciousness , and to describe the way in which that consciousness operates to deduce meaning from the stimuli which it receives _ To do this, we will first consider the fundamental character of the material world in which we have our physical existence in order to accurately perceive the raw stuff with which our consciousness must work_ The first point which needs to be made is that the two terms , matter and energy tena to be misleading if taken to indicate two distinctly different states Of existence in the physical world that we know it_ Indeed_ if the term matter is taken to mean solid substance as opposed to energy which is understood to mean a force of some sort, then the use of the former 18 entirely misleading_ Science now knows that both the electrons_ which in the energy field located around the nucleus of the atom and the nucleus itself are made up of nothing more than oscillating energy grids_ Solid matter, in the strict construction of the term , simply does not exist_ Rather _ atomic structure is composed of oscillating energy surrounded by other oscillating energy which orbit at extraordinarily high speeds _ In his book, Stalking the Wild Pendulum _ Itzhak Bentov gives the following figures The e1oz? which composes the nucleus of the atom vibrates at approximately Hertz( which means 10 followed by 22 zeros) _ At 70 degrees Farenheit an atom oscillates at the rate of Hertz_ An entire molecule, composed of a number of atoms bound together in a single energy field vibrates in the range of Hertz_ A live human cell vibrates at approximately Hertz _ The point to be made is that the entire human being, brain, consciousness and all is, like the universe which surrounds nothing more or less than an extraordinarily complex systen of energy fields _ The so called states of matter are actually variances in the state of energy , and human consciousness is a function of the interaction of energy in two opposite states(motion VS rest) in a manner described in the following paragraph_ 12 _ Holograms. Energy creates , stores and retrieves meaning in the universe by projecting or expanding at certain frequencies in a three dimensional mode that creates a living pattern called a hologram. The' concept Of the hologram can be most easily understood by using an example cited by Bentov in which he asks the reader to visualize a bowl full of water into which three pebbles are dropped . As the ripples created by the simultaneous entry of the three pebbles radiate outwara towards the rim Of the bowl , Bentov further asks the reader to visualize that the surface Of the water is suddenly flash frozen so that the ripple pattern is preservea instantly. The ice is removed leaving the three pebbles still laying at the bottom Of the bowl _ Then the ice 18 exposed to a powerful, coherent source Of light , as a laser The result will be a three dimensional model or representation of the position of the three pebbles suspended in midair. Holograms are capable of encoding s0 detail that, for example, it is possible to take a holographic projection of a glass of swamp water ana view it under magnification to see Small organisms not visible to the naked eye when the glass of water itself is examined_ The whole concept of holography , degpite its Scientific implications , has only been known to the physicist since the underlying mathmatical principles were worked out by Dennis Gabor in 1947(he later won a Nobel Prize for his work) Approved For Release 2003/09/10 CiA-RDP96-00788R001700210016-5 Spin grids grids gria 1015 109 103 him, such much Approved For Release 2003/09/10 CIA-RDP96-00788R0O1700210016-5 Laboratory demongtration of Gabor 9 work only occurred years later following invention of the laser. As biologist Lyall Watson explains: "The purest kind of light available to 48 is that produced by 2 laser, which sends out a beam in which all the waves are Of one frequency , like those made by an ideal pebble in a perfect pond. When two laser beams touch produce an interference pattern of light and dark ripples that can be recorded on a photographic plate _ And if one of the beams _ instead of coming directly from the laser _ 1s reflected first off an object such as a human face, the resulting pattern Will be very complex indeed, but it can still be recorded_ The recora will be a hologram of the face 13 _ The Part Encodes the Whole Of further importance is the fact that even if we dropped our frozen hologram of the ripple pattern on the floor and broke it into a number of pieces each individual piece woula recreate the entire holographic image all by itself_ The Smaller the piece, the fuzzier and more distorted would be the resulting holographic projection but the fact remaing that a whole projection would nonetheless be made The key to creating any hologram 1s that energy in motion must interact with energy in a state Of rest(nonmotion) In the foregoing example , the pebbles represent energy in motion while the water(before its agitation by the pebbles) represents energy at a state of rest To activate or, in effect, to "perceive" the meaning of a holograph , energy ( in this case, a coherent light source such as a laser beam ) must be passed through the interference pattern generated interaction between the moving energy ana the energy at rebt_ In the simple example given by Bentov , this requirement was fulfilled by holding the frozen interference pattern in front of the coherent light to project the three dimensional holographic image( its "meaning" ) into space_ As Marilyn Ferguson , edltor of the Brain/Mina Bulletin tells 43: "Another feature of a hologram 18 its efficlency_ pilliong of bits of information can be stored in a tiny space _ The pattern of the holographic [photograph] is stored everywhere on the plate. 14 _ The Consciousness Matrix_ The universe is composed of interacting energy fields some at rest and some in motion _ It 19, in and of itself, one gigantic hologram of unbelievable complexity. According to the theories of Karl Pribram , a neuroscientist at Stanford University and David Bohm, a physicist at thc University of London _ the human mind 1s also a hologram which attunes itself to the universal hologram by the medium of energy exchange thereby deducing meaning and achieving the state which we call consciousness _ With respect to states of expanded or altered consciougness as Gateway uses , the process operates in the following way Ag energy passes through various aspects of the universal hologram and is perceived by the electrostatic fields which comprise the human mind , the holographic images being conveyed are projected upon those electrostatic fields of the mind and are perceived or understood to the extent that the electrostatic field i8 operating at a frequency and amplitude that can harmonize with and therefore "read" the energy carrier wave pattern pasging through it_ Changes in the frequency and amplitude 0f the electrostatic field which comprises the human mind determineg the configuration ana hence the character of the holographic energy matrix which the mind projects to intercept meaning directly from the holographic transmissions of the universe Then , to make sense of what the holographic image is II saying" to it, the mind proceeds to compare the image just received with itself Specifically, it does this by comparing the image received with that part of its Own hologram which constitutes memory By registering differences in Approved For Release 2003/09/10 CIA-RDP96-00788R001700210016-5 they by such Approved For Release 2003/09/10 CIA-RDP96-00788R0O1700210016-5 geometric form and in energy frequency , the consciousness perceives ( see Exhibit 2 , next page) As psychologist Keith Floya it: "Contrary to what everyone knows is 80 , it may not be the brain that produces consciousness--but rather , congciousness that creates the appearance of the brain 15 _ Brain in phase: The consciousness process 1s most easily envisaged if we picture the holographic Input with a three dimensional system superimposed over it such that all of the energy patterns contained within can be described in terms of three dimensional geometry using mathmatics to reduce the data to two dimensional form . Bentov states that scientists suspect that the human mind operates on a simple binary I system as do all digital computers_ Therefore once it superimposes a three dimensional matrix over holographic information it wishes to interpret and reduces that information mathmatically to two dimensional form, it can completely process it using its fundamental binary sygtem just a6 any computer made by the hana of man can process volumes of data and make various comparisons between the data ana information storea in its digital memory . Our minds operate in the same way , perceiving by comparison only. Bentov states the propogition this way: "Our whole reality 18 constructed by constantly making such comparisons _ Whenever we perceive something, we alway8 perceive differences II In states of expanded consciousness the right hemisphere Of the human brain in its holistic, nonlinear and nonverbal mode of functioning acts as the primary matrix or receptor for tni8 holographic input while by operating in phase or coherence with the right braln, the left hemisphere provides the secondary matrix through its binary, computer-like method of functioning to screen further the data by comparison and reduce it to a discreet, two dimensional form _ 16 Evaluation To the extent that Gateway succeeds in bringing about a rcfinement in energy matrix oE the mind , it succeeds in expanding or altcring human consciousness s0 that it can perceive Without recourse to the intercession of the physical senses such that ever more of the universal hologram(not , of course, accessible by sense perception) can ultimately be perceived and understood_ Marilyn Ferguson has written that the theories of Pribram and Bohm "appear to account for all transtendental experience, paranormal events ana even "normal" perceptual oddities _ II She goes on to say of Pribram: "Currently he 19 proposing a startling, all-encompassing model that 1s generating considerable excitement among those intrigued by the mysteries of human consciousness . His "holographic model" marries brain research to theoretical physics; it accounts for normal perception and Simultaneously takes the paranormal and transcendental experiences out of the supernatural by explaining them as a of nature_ Like certain strange discoveries of quantum physics _ the radical reorientation Of this theory suddenly makes sense of paradoxical sayings of mystics throughout the ages _ 17 _ Self_Cognition To complete our outline of the process by which the mind achieves ana exercises consciousness , we must also describe the mechanism which accounts for the aspect of human thought that differentiates it from the consciousness of plants or animals, i.e_ self cognition _ Humans not only know, but they know that they know They are able to monitor the process of their Own thinking and maintain an awareness of it_ Moreover , can conduct a comparitive Approved For Release 2003/09/10 CIA-RDP96-00788R001700210016-5 puts gria go/no go" only . part they Approved For Release 2003/09/10 CIA-RDP96-00788R0O1700210016-5 The Functions of Brain Hemi spheres in Consciousness CONSCIOUSNESS ENERGY GRID Left Hemi sphere Right Hemisphere Consciousness Grid Consciousness Grid Redluces threc dimons ione Acts like the Mind ' $ holographic image to twC computer software to dimensional go/no go fo= reduce input from right hemi sphcro to vorbal symbols and concepts _ 10 Approved For Release 2003/09/10 CIA-RDP96-00788R001700210016-5 EXHIBIT 2 Approved For Release 2003/09/10 CIA-RDP96-00788R0O1700210016-5 of their thought processes various evaluating the functioning consciousness do this because assessment standards they_ have adopted_ Human project them out "objective" to duplicate aspects of its own hologram, aspect(where_ it has the capacity it through comparison with the memory measure or "perceive" that projection, are storea) of lts own hologram, and 0 its evaluation standards of measure dimensional geometry ana then binary "sense" the differences using three the self_ verbal tion about to our discussion of the Gateway process 18 _ Time-Space_ Dimension_ Up to this Now the fun begins _ Gateway been relatively Gimple and easy to follow_ of the universal hologram which has than just perception of those aspects To how and involves more of time-space as we know it_ can be accessed in dimension transcend the limitations of time-space human consciousness can be brought to this we must first appreciate what why task which must be adaressed .

" To return to our case in point , the human consciousness wa ve pattern reaches high frequency that the pattern of "clickouts "I comes so close together that there 15 virtual continuity in it_ Then, a portion of that consciousness 18 actually postulated to establish and maintain its information collection function in those dimensions located between time-space and the Absolute_ Thus , as the almost continuous "clickout" pattern establishes itself in continuous phase at speeds below Planck S Distance but before reaching the state Of total rest, human consciousness passes through the looking glass of time-space after the fashion of Alice beginning her journey into wonderland The Gateway experience, with its associated Hemi-Sync technique , is apparently designed , if used systematically and patiently, to enable human consciousness to establish a coherent pattern Of perception in those dimensions where speeds below Planck s distance apply . This holds true irrespective of whether the individual is exercising his consciousness while in his physical body or whether he is doing s0 after having separated that consciousness from the physical body( i.e. the s0 called out-of-body state mentioned earlier) 20 _ Subatomic Particles _ The behavior of subatomic particles provides an interesting example of the phenomenon of "clicking out" discussed in the preceding paragraphs_ In an article prepared for Science_Digest magazine, Dr _ John Gliedman mentions the way in which subatomic particles communicate with each other once their energy fields become entrained as a result of colliding with each other_ The communication concerned is, of course, postulated to be occurring during the "click out phase" in the oscillation of the energy fields comprising the subatomic particles concerned. It 18 this cause which accounts for the crosg-communication at what in terms of time-space velocities, would seem to involve speeds in excess of light_ In reality Einstein 5 Theory of Relativity is not being invalidated but, rather, the communication concerned 18 taking place outside the dimension of time-space to which the Theory Of Relativity 18 strictly confined. Specifically, Dr _ Gleidman tells us: "Quantum theory postulates a kina of long range Siamese twin effect whenever two subatomic particles collide and then go their different ways . Even when the particles are halfway across the universe from each other, it says, they instantaneously respond to each other' s actions_ And in So doing, they violate relativity' s ban on faster than light velocities_ 1I Indeed, regarding attempts to quantify what is known about the behavior Of energy in dimensions apparently outside of time-space, Bentov speaks about, courageous physicists who are working on hypothetical particles , called tachyons , which can move at speeds than light_ The speed of tachyons starts just above the speed of light and ranges all the way to infinite velocities." 21 _ Dimensions In-between. Now that we have postulated the legitimacy of the assertion that the energy forms which compose consciousness can move beyond the time-space dimension , we need to turn our attention to the energy forms which Approved For Release 2003/09/10 CIA-RDP96-00788R001700210016-5 10-33 10-33 such his gher Approved Rura@bbadi gpb3r9fotheIA'GUpy6 %8/88.878768240016-5 The AGSOLUTE IN INFiniTy Clicked Out PoRtioN Of oscillating ENERGY TrrveksG ENTERMEDinii BimENsioi 7}plaN CK '$ 10 Porthon of Diftance (o * 33 cm) Oscilating ENERgy Patteen 1 3 in Time-Spa@E out" poRTioN OF PLANcK'$ 10 CLickeD ENeRGY distance %SXE2TNS MEDAIE GimEASIONS (0 "33 Cm THE aBSOLutE IN Infinity 13 Approved For Release 2003/09/10 SYA-RPP?6,80788R001700210016-5 EXHIBIT 3 From; Bentoy, Stalking the Wild -33cML -33cM Approved For Release 2003/09/10 CIA-RDP96-00788R001700210016-5 inhabit those dimensions between time-space and the Absolute. In so doing, we may the form that II reality" assumes when we encounter it in those better perceive intermediate dimensions_ In this context , Bentov tells us that: "The causal relationship between events breaks down ; movements become jerky rather than smooth_ Time and space may become "grainy" or "chunky - Perhaps a piece of space can be traversed by a particle of matter in any direction without necessarily being Synchronized with a piece of time _ In short, a of events will occur in either time or space , the not being connected II causally but by a random fluctuation_ What Bentov means is that inside the dimension of time-space where both concepts apply in a generally uniform way there i8 a proportional relations= between them. A_ certain space can be covered by energy moving in either particle or wave form in a certain time assuming a specific velocity virtually anywhere in the universe The relationship is neat and predictable- However in the fitermeaiete dimensions beyond time-space the limitations imposed on energy to it into a state of oscillating motion are not uniform as they are in our physical universe_ A_ myriad of various distortions and incongruities are thus likely to be encountered such that our nice neat assumptions concerning the relationship between time and space as we know it in this dimension do not apply . But even more access is opened to both the and the future when the dimension of important _ current time-space is left behind _ 22 _ Special Status Out-of-Body_Experience: Although human consciousness can, with enough practice, move beyond the dimension of time-space and interface with other energy systems in other dimensions_ the entire process 18 appreciably enhanced 1f that consciousness can be detached in large measure from the physical before such interface is attempted. Once an individual becomes icient in the technique of out-of-body movement and then reaches the point where he 1s able to break out of time-space while of his body , he the advantage f "clicking out" of his enhanced consciousness while starting from a base located much closer to the dimensions with which he wishes to communicate_ In other words, since he is starting from a point II higher up to use an analogy from the time-space context, that of his consciousness involved in "clicking out" will have that much more time to interact in dimensions beyond time-space because less time is required to traverse the intervening layers _ Moreover, once the individual is able to project his consciousness beyond time-space, that congciousness would logically tend to entrain its frequency output with the new environment to which it i9 exposed, therein greatly enhancing the extent to ehecgy_ the individual' s altered consciousness may be further modified to achieve a much heightened point of focus ana a much refined oscillating pattern. As a result, a self-reinforcing process should ensue whereby the farther consciousness in the out-of-body state can be projected beyond the time-space dimension, the more its level of energy output woula be enhanced, thus promoting the potential for still further travel_ The tentative conclusion to be drawn is that the out-of-body state be regarded as an extremely effective way of accelerating the process of ethteciay bonseforseess and of interfacing with dimensions beyond time-space _ If the practitioner Of the Gateway technique has a choice of concentrating on achieving and exploiting the out-of-body experience a6 opposed to concentrating his full efforts on expanding his consciousness exclusively from a physical base, the former woula appear to promise faster and more impressive successes than does the latter 23_ Absolute in Perspective_ It be helpful at this point to pause and recap 14 Approved For Release 2003/09/10 CIA-RDP96-00788R001700210016-5 pair pair hip put past prof- body gains out part much part much may Approved For Release 2003/09/10 CIA-RDP96-00788R0O1700210016-5 the major aspects of our intellectual journey from time-space to the realm of the Absolute. We have spoken at some length concerning the incredibly complex hologram which is created by the intersection of energy patterns generated by the totality of all dimensions Of the universe, time-space included_ We have noted that our minds constitute energy fields which interact with various aspects of this hologram to deduce information which is ultimately processed through the left hemisphere of our brains to reduce it to a form that we employ for the process we call thinking. We have implied that this hologram 15 the finite embodiment in active _ energy form of the infinite consciousness of the Absolute. It is the title we assigned to that vast Of energy in a state of perfect rest over which the physical universe is layered, and from whence it comes _ Incidentally, to describe this_ Bentov uses the analogy of a very sea, comparing the still depths of the sea to the dimension of the Absolute while assigning the storm-tossed wa ves above to represent the physical universe with which we are familiar_ The slightly agitated currents of the sea to be found in between the turbulent surface and the totally still depths represent energy in the process of either going into rest(i.e. approaching infinity) or coming out of rest. 24 _ From Big_Bang to Torus _ Working from the widely accepted "Big Bang" theory Bentov presents a conceptual model to depict the process of time-space evolution the relative position of the universal hologram _ That hologram is often called a "Torus" because it is thought to ha ve the overall shape Of an immense, self-contained spiral. Basing his thesis on recent studies concerning the distribution of quasars(quasi-stellar objects) and operating on the premise that in the universe Smaller processes tend to be mirror images of larger ones(i .e the pattern of electrons around the nucleus of an atom mirrors the way planets orbit their suns, and so on) Bentov postulates the following scenario_ Taking his cue from the observed capability of quasars to eject enormously concentrated beams of matter from their interiors in a controlled, non-concentric version of the " Big-bang" he envisages a similar process occurring in the generation of the universe see Exhibit 4 , next page) Noting that those galaxies located to the north of our own galaxy are moving away faster than those located to the south, and that those to the east and west are demonstrably more distant, Bentov regards this as substantive evidence that the jet of matter which expanded into our universe has turned back upon itself , eventually forming an ovoid or egg shape. He sees "matter" in our universe entering the ovoid pattern following ejection from a nucleus composed of extremely compressed energy through a "white hole_ "I At the end of its trip to the far end of the ovoid, he sees it departing via a II black hole" In such a model, time is observed to be a measure Of the change which occurs as energy evolves into new , more complex forms as it progresses along the distance from the white hole side of the nucleus , around the shell Of this " cosmic egg" until it enters the black hole_ In other words as energy--expelled from infinity and confined within limits by the conscious of the Absolute--achieves form and motion following ejection from the white hole at the of the egg , time begins as a measure of the cadence of this evolutionary movement as "reality" goes around the shell of the egg on its journey to the black hole at the far end _ 25 _ Our Place in Time _ The observed distribution of galaxies suggests that our particular universe is located near the 0f the egg at the point where matter begins to fall back on itself, thus explaining the reason why the galaxies to the north are seen to be moving away more rapidly as they are caught up in the downturn of the stream of matter towards the far end Of the cosmic egg ( see Exhibit 5 , next page) _ Layered over this cosmic egg is the Absolute which sustains the radiating nucleus from which the original jet of matter issued forth.

Thus , the more complex an energy system in the "material" state, the more consciousness it possesses to maintain its reality. Our consciousness , therefore, 1s that differentiated aspect of the universal consciousness which resides within the Absolute It accounts for the organization of the energy patterns which constitute our physical body but is distinctly separate from and superior to it_ Since consciousness exists quite apart from and outside of reality, beyond the bounds of time-space, it, like the Absolute has neither beginning nor end_ Reality both a beginning and an end because it is bounded within time-space, but the fundamental quantum of energy ana its associated consciousness is eternal _ When reality ends , its constituent energy simply returns to infinity in the Absolute. 27 _ Consciousness in Perspective Ha ascertained that human consciousness is able to separate from physical reality and interact with other intelligences in other dimensions within the universe, and that it is both eternal and destined for ultimate return to the Absolute we are faced with the question: "So what happens then?" Since memory is a function of consciousness and therefore enjoys the same eternal character as the consciousness which accounts for its existence it must be admitted that when consciousness returns to the Absolute it brings with it all the memories it has accumulated through experience in reality_ The return of consciousness to the Absolute does not imply an extinction of the separate entity which the consciousness organized ana sustained in reality_ Rather, it suggests a differentiated consciousness which merges with and participates in the universal consciousness and infinity of the Absolute without losing the separate identity and Approved For Release 2003/09/10 CIA-RDP96-00788R001700210016-5 they past spiral body zing point pool has ving ApprovedRelareKeaso5d6399/R6 :FA-GtJag3-ofr8870dli882i8o16-5 GALAxy Galactic South 17 For Release 2003/09/10 CIA-RDP96-00788R001700210016-5 EXHIBIT 5 ApprovedeFzoRelezse 2903 the wild Pendulu GALnctlc North our 3 1 WJHIte AOle NUQEWS Approved For Release 2003/09/10 CIA-RDP96-00788R0O1700210016-5 accummulated self-knowledge which its memories confer upon it_ What it does lose is the capability for generation of independent thought holograms_ since that can be done only by energy in motion_ In other words , it retains the power to perceive but loses the power of will or choice_ In exchange , however , this consciousness participates in the all-knowing infinite continuum of consciousness which 1s a characteristic of energy in the ever present Consequently, it is accurate to observe that when a person experiences the out-of- body state he 18, in fact , projecting that eternal spark Of consciousness and memory which constitutes the ultimate source of his identity to let it play in and learn from dimensions both inside and outside the time-space worla in which his physical component currently enjoys a short period Of reality_ 28 _ Gateway Method _ Having the Gateway Experience in context by postulating a structural outline of how and why it seems to work, and having shown what it is designed to achieve _ the time has come to examine the specific techniques which comprise the Gateway training process_ These techniques are designea to enable the user of the Gateway tapes to manipulate the high energy states which can be achieved if the user continues to work with the tapes over a period of time The amount of time required to reach advanced energy states and to fully exploit the techniques varies with the individual_ The sensitivity Of his nervous system, his general state of mind , and the extent to which he may have previously. developed facility in related techniques such as transcendental meditation are all pertinent factors affecting the speed at which he may expect to progress _ The Gateway process begins by teaching the individual participant to isolate extraneous concerns in a visualization device called "energy conversion box _ Next, the participant is introduced to a method of encouraging his mind ana body to strive to achieve a state of resonance through utterance of a Bingle tone, a monotonous, protracted humming sound that sets up a feeling of vibration particularly in the head. He engages in this Mi resonate tuning" as it is called by humming along with a chorus of such sounds that are contained on the Gateway tape _ Following this, the participant 18 exposed to the Gateway affirmation, and 18 encouraged to repeat it to himself as he hears it repeated on the tape. This affirmation is a statement to the effect that the individual realizes that he is more than merely a physical body and that he deeply desires to expand his consciousness 29 _ Hemi-Sync Introduced. After that, he is exposed for the first time to the Hemi-Sync gouna frequencies , and is encouraged to focus on and develop a perception of and appreciation for those feelings which accompany the synchronization of brainwaves that results_ Next comes the technique of progressive and systematic physical relaxation while the Hemi-Sync frequencies are expanded to include additional forms of "pink and white" noise designea to put the physical body at the virtual threshhold of sleep as well as to calm the left hemisphere of the mind while raising the right hemi sphere to a state of heightened attentiveness _ Once of this 1s achieved the participant is invited to envisage creation Of an "energy balloon" comprised of an energy flow beginning at the center of the of the head and extending down in all directions to the feet _ The energy involved in this flow then proceeds up through the and back out into the balloon pattern again. The Ii energy balloon' M which sets up a pattern very reminiscent Of the cosmic egg discussed earlier , not enhances bodily energy flow and encourages early achievement of a suitable resonant state but it is also designed to provide protection against conscious entities possessing lower energy levels which the participant might encounter in the event that he achieves an out-of-body, state_ It serves a precautionary purpose in the unlikely event that the participant 8 first out-of-body experience involves direct projection outside the terrestrial sphere. 19 Approved For Release 2003/09/10 CIA-RDP96-00788R001700210016-5 put an all top body only Approved For Release 2003/09/10 CIA-RDP96-00788R001700210016-5 Techniques_ Having reached Focus 10 , the participant is now ready to 30 _ vavancedcheebe a state of sufficiently expanded awareness to begin actually endeavor to interacting with dimensions beyond those associated with his experience of physical This state 18 called Focus 12 and involves conscious efforts on his reiletyc additional forms of "pink and white noise" enter the sound Stream being directed into his ears from the Gateway tape_ Once the participant has achieved this state of greatly expanded awareness , he 18 ready to begin employing a series of specific techniques Or "tools" as the Monroe Institute characterizes them which enable him to manipulate his newly found expanded awareness to obtain practical, useful feedback of value for promoting self-discovery and personal growth_ The specific techniques involved are described individually below A= Problem Solving: This technique involves identifying fundamental problems which the individual wishes to see bolved _ filling his expanded awareness With his of these problems and then projecting them out into the universe _ In Bezsepayonthe individual enlists the assistance of what Monroe Institute :calls his this #I self" in other words his expanded consciousness, to interact with the higher to obtain the information required to solve the problem_ This universal hologram difficulties, technical problems in the approach may be used to solve personal mathmatics, etc., practical administrative problems_ and 80 on realm of physics , be received almost immediately, but Responses to the problem solving technique may often they come based on developing intuition over the next two to three days_ the response comes in the form of a suaden, holistic perception in which Frequently suddenly finds that he simply knows the answer in all of its the individual context, sometimes without even being able to ramifications ana completely in into words , at least initially. In some cases the res oeseynouadepercepteoin the form of visual symbols which the individual response may even afindewhile he is in the Focus 12 state and which he will have to will"see" with his mind interpret after he returns to normal consciousness . B_ Patterning_ This technique involves use of the consciousness to achieve desired objectives in the physical, emotional, or intellectual sphere _ It involves on the desired objective while in a Focus 12 state, extension of the ioafeid.atio pecebeide Of that objective into the whole expanded consciousness, an its projection into the universe with the intention that the desired objective matter of established achievement which is destined to be realized 18 already a methodology is based on the within the time frame specified. This particular belief that the thought patterns generated by our consciousness in a state of awareness create holograms which represent the situation we desire to exDagdebout and, in so doing, establish the basis for actual realization of that bring the thought-generated hologram of the sought after objective 15 eot1blighee in the verse it becomes an aspect of reality which interacts with the universal hologram to bring about the desired objective which might not, under other circumstances, ever occur_ In other words the technique of patterning zes the fact that since consciousness is the source of all reality, our recogni have the power to influence the development of reality in time-space as it apolgetsto us if those thoughts can be projected with adequate intensity. However, the more complicated the objective sought and the more radically it departs from current reality, the more time the universal hologram Will need to reorient our our reality to accomodate our desires_ Monroe trainers caution against attempting to force the pace of this process because the individual could succeea in dislocating his existing reality with drastic consequences _ C Color_Breathing_ The next technique 18 called color breathing and is Approved For Release 2003/09/10 CrRDP96-00788R001700210016-5 part way , put goal _ uni- sphere Approved For Release 2003/09/10 CIA-RDP96-00788R001700210016-5 designed to use the expanded awareness and highly focused attentiveness associated with the Focus 12 state to imagine varioug colors in a particularly intense and vivid manner so as to use them to resonate with and in turn to activate the body' s Fundamentally, in terms of practical application it is a healing own energies _ technique which is designed to restore the body and to enhance its physical capabilities by balancing, revitalizing and retuning bodily energy flows _ It is predicated on the principle that the body' 9 electromagnetic field is capable of altering its resonance pattern s0 as to entrain energy from the earth' 9 electrostatic field for its own use. The various colors envisaged in the imagination as part of the technique cue the mind as to which frequencies and what specific amplitudes are desirea in connection with this entrainment and the subsequent alterations in bodily energy flow patterns_ That color has the capacity to affect the human mind is well known , and the affectuality of color in certain kinds of healing is a demonstrable fact For example, application of an intense blue light to an area of physical tumescence leads to relatively rapid and easily observable reduction in the swelling while red, and to a lesser extent, yellow have quite the opposite effect However, in the Hemi-Sync application of the :technique external light sources are not involved but , rather, the mind is the sole agent Of the healing and revitalization_ D _ Energy Bar Tool_ Magic wands and enchanted sceptors have been part of the folklore and occult practices of many cultures. The scepters , staffs ana maces carried by monarchs and high priests alike occur with such frequency in the history of bygone eras as to suggest that at the very least these items are aspects of some type of archtypical symbol which the human mind seems to appreciate, perhaps quite subliminally - In any case, the energy bar tool technique involves envisaging a small intensely pulsating dot of light which the participant charges in his 1 imagination with enormous energy until it i9 virtually pulsating. The participant then extrudes the dot into the shape of a sparkling , vibrating cylinder Of energy which he then uses to channel force from the universe to selected parts of his for purposes of healing and revitalization_ E Remote_Viewing. In addition, the energy bar tool is used as a portal for initiating a follow-on technique callea m1 remote viewing. II In this context, the participant turns his bar Of energy into a whirling vortex through which he sends his imagination in search of new and illuminating insights_ The apparent purpose 0f the symbolism involved in the vortex seems to be to cue the subconscious and to it instructions as to what the participant wishes to do but in terms of convey nonverbal symbols which the right heni sphere of the mind 15 capable of understanding _ F Living_Body_ This technique provides amplification for application of the energy bar tool as a means of healing specific areas or systems of the human The configuration of the participant 5 body 18 imagined and then the various body _ major systems such as the nervous and circulatory systems are envisaged in appropriate colors within the confines of the outline being hela in the imagination_ The energy bar tool 1s then applied to energizing, balancing and healing in whatever manner the participant desires _ In the process , the visualizes various streans Of colored energy flowing out of the tool Ratticheaots organ system or area upon which the revitalizing or healing application is being made- Since colors are the result of differing wa velengths of light, which is to say energy at various frequencies- this technique operates on the assumption that as the human body is composed of energy it can be vitalized and healed through the additive application of additional energy provided that the energy is applied in the appropriate form_ Approved For Release 2003/09/10 CRA-RDP96-00788R001700210016-5 bbody Map Approved For Release 2003/09/10 CIA-RDP96-00788R0O1700210016-5 G Focus 15: Travel into the Past . All of the preceding techniques are conducted at the level Of expandea awareness known as Focus 12 _ However , the technique of time travel into the past involves further expangion of consciousness through the inclusion of additional levels of sound on the Hemi-Sync tapes . Some Of the souna i8 probably merely an intensification of the basic Hemi-Sync frequencies , being designed to further modify brainwave frequency and amplitude _ Other aspects of the addea sound patterns appear to be designed to provide subtle, almost Subliminal suggestions to the mina as to what is desired by way of further expanded consciousness so as to support the verbal suggestions and instructions also contained on the tape _ Even the instructions are highly Symbolic, with time being visualized as a huge wheel in the universe with various spokes each of which gives access to a different of the participant' 8 past . Focus 15 1s a very advanced state and is extremely difficult to achieve . Probably less than five percent of all participants in any Gateway Experience actually fully achieve the Focus 15 state dur the course of the approximately seven days of training. Nonetheless , Monroe Institute trainers affirm that with enough practice, eventually Focus 15 can be achieved _ They also state that not the individual '9 past history is available for examination by one who has achieved Focus 15 but other aspects of the with which the individual himself has had no connection may also be accessea. H_ Focus 21: The Future. The last and most advanced of all the Focus states associatea with the Gateway training program involves movement outside of the boundaries of time-space as in Focus 15 but with attention to discovering the future rather than the past_ The individual who has achieved this state has reached a truly advanced level. Except in unusual circumstances, it 1s probably not attainable except by those who have conditioned themselves through long application Of meditation or by those who have practiced long and hard through use of the Hemi-Sync tapes for a period of months if not years _ 31 _ The Out-of-Body Movement . This remarkable phenomenon has been saved for discussion in detail until last because of the interest which it occasions ana special circumstances involved in its attainment _ Monroe Institute stresses that the Gateway program was not established solely for the purpose of enabling participants to obtain the out-of-body state nor does the program guarantee that most participants will succeed in doing it during the course Of the training at the Institute. one tape out of the many which make up the Gateway Experience is devoted to the techniques involved in the out-of-body movement . Basically, these techniques are merely designed to make it easier for the individual to achieve the out-of-body state when his brainwave pattern and personal energy levels have reached a point that he is in apparent harmony with his surrounding electromagnetic environment such that he feels that he ha8 reached the threshhold where separation is a possibility. To facilitate achieving the out-of-body state, Bob Monroe , the founder of Monroe Institute, is quoted in a recent magazine article as saying that in order to assist the participant the particular Hemi-Sync tape concerned with that technique employs Beta signals of "around 2877.3 CPS _ (cycles per second) _ Since 30 to 40 CPS is considered to be the normal range for Beta brainwave signals ( those asgociated with the wakeful state), it is apparent that the Monroe Institute is convinced that the same heightened state Of brainwa ve frequency output which promotes altered states of consciousness is also an important consideration in assisting in achievement of out-of-body states The actual techniques employed for separating from the body involve simple maneuvers as rolling out, lifting out after the fashion of a telephone pole wherein the individual separates in a rigid, headfirst manner ( such that he finds himself standing at attention at the Approved For Release 2003/09/10 CFR-RDP96-00788R001700210016-5 part given ing only past Only such Approved For Release 2003/09/10 CIA-RDP96-00788R0O1700210016-5 foot of his physical body) and sliding out through either end of his body _ 32 _ Role of REM_Sleep: It 18 interesting to note that Bob Monroe informed the Gateway class that finished 7 May 1983 that an ex-trainer of his operating in Charlottesville, Virginia found that he could guarantee out-of-body movements by bringing participants down into a rapid eye movement ( REM) state of sleep and then use the Hemi-Sync tape technique_ This may well be a function of the fact that most if not all people reputedly go into an out-of-body state during REM sleep _ REM sleep is the deepest possible level Of ordinary sleep and involves complete disengagement of the body 5 motor cortex functions from the neck down and nearly suppression of consciousness in the left brain hemisphere _ The effect of tonglete is to the body in a state of complete stillness so far as the skeletal muscle structure is concerned , thereby further promoting the state of rest needed to eliminate the bifurcation echo In addition, it leaves the right hemi of the brain free to respona to the instructions and suggestions contained on the Gateway tape_ However_ use of the Hemi-Sync tapes at this be less a factor in actually achieving the out-of-body state than it is a mattbe of focusing the brain enough 80 that a residual memory of having naturally achieved an out-of-body state is carried into the waking state_ Indeed, it may even be postulated that some dreams associated with deep levels of sleep are in fact functions of the same kind of altered consciousness involved in interaction with the universe that plays a role in all of the Focus 12 15 and 21 states described above _ The difference between those states and the condition Of the mind in REM s leep seems to be that the left hemisphere 15 almost totally disengaged in the latter experience such that memory of what was achieved in the altered states of consciousness cannot ugually be retrieved by conscious desire because the left hemi sphere has no knowledge of its existence or its location in the right hemisphere_ Admittedly, some people can be trained to remember their REM state dreams through intense conditioning in the waking state but even that may be more a function Of establishing pathways in the right hemi= which the left hemi sphere following reentry into the wakeful state than it 1s an indication of any can access specific left hemi sphere conscioug involvement in the process during REM sleep _ In any event, the three apparent conditions required for voluntarily inducing an out-of-body state in most individuals seems to be : (1) achievement of a state of ound quiet in the such that the bifurcation echo fades and resonance at approximately 7 Hertz is established, (2 ) synchronization of the two brain hemi sphere wave patterns , and (3) subsequent stimulation of the right hemisphere of the mind to attain a state of heightened alertness( which, of course interferes with brain hemi sphere synchronization but not until a sufficient level of enhanced frequency range has first been established to help achieve the out-of-body state) 33 _ Information Collection Potential. The information acquisition potential assoclated with the out-of-body state seems to attract the most attention from the standpoint of developing practical applications for the Gateway technique Unfortunately, although the out-of-body state can apparently be achieved by many people without excessive expenditure of time or effort, the purposes to which it can be are currently limited by the fact that although individuals in that state may travel anywhere on an instantaneous basis in either the terrestrial or in other spheres, information distortion in the former context remains a major concern_ To date_ according to one of the trainers at Monroe Institute, numerous experiments have been conducted involving persons moving from one coast to the other in the out-of-body state to reaa a series of ten computer generated numbers in a university laboratory _ Although most have aquired enough of the digits to make clear that their consciousness was present none have ever succeeded in getting all ten correct _ This seems to be a function of the fact that physical reality in Approved For Release 2003/09/10 C1A-RDP96-00788R001700210016-5 put deep sphere point sphere body profe put Approved For Release 2003/09/10 CIA-RDP96-00788ROO1700210016-5 the present is not the only holographic influence which the individual may encounter in an out-of-body state_ There are also energy patterns left by people or events occurring at the same physical site being viewed_ but from the rather than the present_ In addition, since thoughts are the product of energy patterns, and energy patterns are reality, it may also be possible that individuals encounter thought forms while in an out-of-body state which mingle with physical reality and are not easily differentiated. Finally, as Melissa Jager writes, there is another potential problem area in the sense that holograms can be viewed that 1s to say inside out or backwards just a5 well as they can beeseescopipaoper seen in proper perspective Some of the distortions occurring may ultimately to be traceable to this cause because in the out-of-body state an individual may perceive the holographic energy patterns given off by people or things interacting in time-space reality in a somewhat distortea form. 34 . Belief System_Considerations : In 1967 _ Alexandra David-Neel and Llama Yongden wrote a book entitled Secret Oral Teachings in Tibetan Buddhist Sects, from which the following quote is taken: "The tangible world 1s movement , say the Masters, not a collection of moving but movement itself_ There are no objects "in movement , it is the objegest which constitutes the objects which appear to uS: They are nothing but movement - This movement is a continued and infinitely rapid succession of flashes Of energy( in Tibetan "tsal" or "shoug" ) All objects perceptible to our senses , all phenomena of whatever kind and whatever aspect they may assune , are constituted by a rapid succession of instantaneous events_ The classic description of the universal hologram is to be found in a Hindu sutra which says : "In the heaven of Indra there is said to be a network of pearls 90 arranged "F that if you look at one you see all the others reflected in it. I have cited this quotation because it shows that the concept of the universe which at least some physicists are now coming to accept is identical in its essential with the one known to the learned elite in selected civilizations and calegtes of high attainment in the ancient world_ The concept of the cosmic egg, for example , is well known to scholars familiar with the ancient writings of the eastern religions. Nor are the theories presented in this paper at variance with the essential tenets of the Judeo-Christian stream of thought _ The concept Of visible reality(i.e_ the "created" worla) as being an emanation of an omnipotent and omniscient divinity who 18 completely unknowable in his primary state of being _ The Absolute at rest in infinity is a concept straight out Of Hebrew mystical philosophy _ Even the Christian concept of the Trinity shines through the description of the Absolute a5 presentea in this paper. The description of energy totally at rest, in infinity fits the Christian metaphysical concept of the Father while the infinite self-consciousness resident in that energy providing the motive force Of will to bring a portion of that energy into motion to create reality corre sponds with the Son. This is 90 because in order to attain self-consciousness, the consciousness of the Absolute must project a hologram of itself and then perceive it_ That hologram is a mirror image of the Absolute in infinity, still exists outside time and space, but is one step removed from the Absolute and is the actual agent Of all creation(all reality) And , the eternal thought or concept of self which results from this self-consciousness serves the 24 Approved For Release 2003/09/10 CIA-RDP96-00788R001700210016-5 past prove Approved For Release 2003/09/10 CIA-RDP96-00788R001700210016-5 37 _ Motivational Aspect . It is a step by procedure which involves repetitive practice of the techniques concerned, using each new insight as a means of penetrating farther during the next practice session . But the rate of progress is S0 much fagter with the Gateway approach than it is with transcendental meditation or other forms of mental self-discipline and its horizons seem to be so much wider that the discipline needed to practice it would seem to be within the means of even the impatient , result oriented, skeptical pragmatist of our society_ Unlike yoga and other forms of eastern mental discipline_ Gateway does not require the infinite patience and total personal subservience to and faith in a system of discipline designed to absorb all the individual' 9 energies over most Of a lifetime Rather , it will begin to produce at least minimal results within a relatively short time such that enough feedback 1s available to motivate and energize the individual to continue working with it Indeed, the speed with which an individual may expect to seems less a function Of the number of hours spent practicing than it is a Quegteos of the speed with which he or she is able to use the insights gained to release anxieties and stresses within both the mind and the body _ These points Of energy blockage seem to provide the principal barriers to achieving the enhanced energy states and focus of mind needed for rapid progression. The more compulsive, the more "uptight" the individual may be at the outset the more barriers he or she will initially encounter to achieving a deep or immediate experience, but as the insights begin to come and the blockages begin to dissolve the way ahead becomes increasingly clear and the value of Gateway moves from the status of a matter of intellectual assessment to one of personal experience. 38 _ Conclusion. There is a sound , rational basis in terms of physical science parameters for considering Gateway to be plausible in terms of its essential objectives_ Intuitional insights of not personal but of a practical and professional nature would seem to be within bounds of reasonable expectations _ However, a phased approach for entering the Gateway Experience in an accelerated mode woula seem to be required if the time needed to reach advanced states of altered consciousness 1s to be brought within more manageable limits from the standpoint of establishing an organization-wide exploitation of Gateway' s potential_ The most promiging approach suggested in the foregoing study involves the following steps : A_ Begin by using the Gateway Hemi-Sync tapes to achieve enhanced brain focus and to induce hemisphere Synchronization_ B Then add strong REM sleep frequencies to induce left brain quiescence and deep physical relaxation_ C Provide hypnotic suggestion designed to enable an individual to induce deep autohypnotic state at will. D Use autohypnotic suggestion to attain much enhanced focus of concentration and motivation in rapidly progressing through Focus 12 exercises E_ Then repeat steps A and B following use Of the autohypnotic suggestion that an out-of-body movement will occur and be remembered . F Repeat step E to achieve facility in gaining out-of-body state under conscious control Alter hypnotic suggestion to stress ability to consciously control out-of-body movement and maintain it even after REM sleep state ends _ G _ Approach Focus 15 ana 21 objectives ( escape from time-space ana interact Approved For Release 2003/09/10 CIAGRDP96-00788R001700210016-5 ;; step only Xi:: Approved For Release 2003/09/10 CIA-RDP96-00788R001700210016-5 within new dimensions) from the out-of-body perspective_ H_ Use multi-focus approach to solve problem of distortion in terrestrial information gathering trips_ This approach involves the use of three individuals in the out-of-body state, one viewing the target object here, in time-space , one viewing it at Focus 15 as it slips into the imediate past , and one viewing it at Focus 21 as it slips from the immediate future. Debrief all three and compare data gathered from the three points of view. If care is taken to insure that the three all go out-of-body together , in the same environment, their consciousness energy should resonate in sympathetic oscillation- They can tune in to the same systems target on different planes( dimensions) with greater effectiveness _ I_ Encourage pursuit of full self knowledge by all individuals involved in the foregoing experiments to enhance objectivity in out-of-body observation and thinking, and to remove personal energy blockages likely to retard rapid progress . J_ Be intellectually prepared to react to possible encounters with intelligent , non-corporal energy forms when time-space boundaries are exceeded. K_ Arrange to have groups of people in Focus 12 state unite their altered consciousness to build holographic patterns around sensitive areas to repulse possible unwanted out-of-body presences _ L_ Encourage more advanced Gateway participants to build holographic patterns of successful attainment and progress for advanced colleagues to assist them in progressing through the Gateway system. If these experiments are carried through , it is to be hoped that will truly find a gateway to Gateway and to the realm of practical application for the whole system of techniques which comprise it.

Dolomieu, the famous min- eralogist, joined the consensus, as did Escher and Forel, the Swiss geologists; also J: Andre DeLuc Jr., and Von Buch: all agreed that the cataclysms were caused by sudden revolutions of the surface of the earth: > Cuvier, in his `Theory of the Earth; first published in 1812, based his conclusions on his unparalleled correla- tive research in stratigraphy, comparative anatomy, and palaeontology. At that time he wrote: "Every part of the earth, every hemisphere, every continent; exhibits the same phenomenon. There therefore, been a succession of variations in the economy of organic nature the various catastrophes which have disturbed the strata have given rise to numerous shiftings of this (continental) basin: It is of much importance to mark, that these repeated irruptions and retreats of the sea have neither been slow nor gradual; on the contrary, most of the catastrophes which occasioned them have been sudden; and this is especially easy to be proved, with to the last of these catastrophes. I agree, there- fore; with MM DeLuc and Dolomieu, in thinking, that if anything in geology be established; it is, that the surface of our globe has undergone a great and sudden revolution, the date of which cannot be much earlier than five or Six thousand years ago (also) one preceding revolution at least had put (the continents) under 3) water perhaps two or three irruptions of the sea.

These ideas have haunted, I may almost say have tormented me, during my researches among fossil bones researches which embrace but a very small part of those phenomena of the age preceding the last general revolution of the globe, and which are intimately connected with all the others. attempts have been made to answer the charge made to the geological profession by Cuvier to these sudden revolutions Among others; Velikovsky tried it through his study of and legends; Hapgood tried Brown attempted, and in the process amassed a tre- mendous library of geological data: Every time the cataclysmic concept has come to life, 9) the *beast has been stoned, burned at the stake, beaten to a pulp, and buried with a vengeance; but the corpse simply won't stay dead.

The first step was to gather all of the known, ac- cepted data from as many "earth )) sciences as possible: stratigraphy, archaeology, anthropology, palaeontology, radiology, oceanography, seismology, glaciology, and many other fields Correlation of the data between the sciences gave the answer: although there is enough data in each science to indicate that these cataclysms happen, there was not enough to prove the concept; but between-science correlation showed indeed that the concept was true.

From the first time I heard the story of the creation and Adam and Eve, it (buzzed" me, as my young son would say . Now, to me the answer was not simply one of two usual alternatives: either unquestioning faith in the story as it stands, or complete repudiation as utter nonsense _ the answer seemed to lie elsewhere. If the story were taught as the truth SO uniformly; in of its ap- parent divergence from scientific truths, then to me the true course would seem to be a search for the foundation of the story, which would then lead to a true reading of it. The pursuit happened almost by accident Years of data correlation in studying the earth tumbling concept has shown the last tumble to have occurred about 6500 years ag0; that Noah; or Utnapishtim, or whatever his name did exist and did survive that particular cataclysm: A friend of mine suggested that Genesis I is almost 3 perfect description of conditions on our planet immedi- ately following a tumble: On rereading it; I had to agree; Genesis II even mentions that a mist; or flood, went up from the earth and watered the whole face of the ground Well; now! This was worth thinking about: If it were sS0, then it would be the tumble preceding Noah's (another fascinating story! ) , about 11,500 years ago. This, then could be approximately the time of the Adam and Eve story_ The pursuit started. If the story did originate with that tumble; in what language was it first written? Certainly not Hebrew Or Greek; for as far as we know , didn't exist at that time. 21 Declassified in Part Sanitized Approved for Release 2013/06/24 : CIA-RDP79BOO752AO00300070001-8 Copy things; No, spite was, they Copy Declassified in Part Sanitized Approved for Release 2013/08/24 CIA-RDP79B0O752A000300070001-8 If we look to men such as Don Antonio Batres Juarequi and James Churchward; we may have our answer. Certain - Jy their knowledge of prehistoric languages could be a and later weIl discuss the role of and Ancient Mayan in the story of Adam and Eve; first, however, let's examine the history of Genesis I, II, and III: There are many schools of thought on this subject, but the most predominant one is that Moses was the origi- nator. This seems not too far-fetched, since Moses was reared in the Egyptian tradition, in & royal household, and probably had access to many religious writings and teach- now lost with the passing of the archives of in Alexandria, Heliopolis, and Sais. Certainly the Ten Commandments were a condensation of the forty-two questions of Osiris for entering heaven: If Moses did write part of the Old Testament, he then must have had tablet writings, o Egyptian interpretations of them, hand- ed down to the Egyptians for thousands of years; and the Egyptian priesthood had knowledge of a cataclysm 11,500 years ago. Priests of Egypt are supposed to have told Solon during his ten years in Egypt (about 600 B.C) that 9,000 years before that time there was a cataclysm which buried Atlantis beneath the ocean: Note that 9,000 600 B.C. 1950 AD equals 11,550 years ag0. Moses' brother, Aaron, became the first chief priest of the Hebrews about 1300 B.C. Somewhere between 15 and 18 generations later, the chief priesthood having been handed down father-son through the generations, Seraiah (or Seraias) was the chief priest (See Ezra, and 1 and 2 Ezdras) In 586 B.C,, in the I9th year of Nebuchadnez- S reign, Seraiah was taken and executed, and his son Ezra made a captive in Persia (see 2 Kings) _ At that time; Jerusalem was sacked, and all Hebrew records including their laws and records of the Old Testament were burned with the temple at Jerusalem, by Nebuza-adan, Nebuch- adnezzar $ captain of the guard: 22 Declassified in Part Sanitized Approved for Release 2013/06/24 CIA-RDP79BOO752AOO0300070001-8 Copy key, Naga_ Egypt, ings Naga zar s Copy Declassified in Part Sanitized Approved for Release 2013/068/24 : CIA-RDP79BOO752A000300070001-8 In 458 B.C, during the seventh year of Artaxerxes Is in Persia, Ezra was commissioned to reestablish the Hebrew religion and law. According to 2 Ezdras, Ezra rewrote the history of the Hebrews from the beginning, and reestablished their laws: Now, from 586 to 458 B.C. is 128 years The latest that Ezra could have been born was after his father Seraiah's murder, as well could be (see Onan's story, Genesis 38:8- 10) ; therefore, the youngest he could have been in 458 BC was 127 . He was working on a memory. Let's examine this anomaly. As mentioned before, the lineage from Aaron to Ezra contains from 17 to 20 genera- tions; including Aaron and Ezra. Assuming (1) 1300 B.C; for the start of Aaron'$ priesthood (1290 B.C. is adjudged the time of the Exodus) ; (2) 458 B.C. to be near the end of Ezra'$ priesthood; then we find the average priesthood term per generation to be between 42.1 and 49.5 years. In view of this, can we believe that Ezra served his hood for approximately 130 years? It would appear much more plausible to assume that it was Ezra 's grandfather, Azariah rather than his father Seraiah, who was the one taken and executed by Nebuch- adnezzar's men in 586 B.C. Then Seraiah and Ezra would have served as chief priests during the 128 years from 586 to 458 B.C., for an average of 64 years apiece: It is even plausible that Ezra' s great-grandfather Helchiah could have been the victim in 586 B.C ; leaving Azariah, Seraiah, and Ezra to serve the 128 years for an average of 42 years each; which is even closer to the overall average from Aaron to Ezra, over a period of about 845 years This means that the Adam and Eve story was last seen in writing by Helchiah or Azariah, therefore handed down verbally possibly by Azariah, and certainly by Seraiah and Ezra, and finally dictated by Ezra to five scribes. It is the five scribes' writings that we have today as Ezra s work And the English is not even a literal translation for instance; *without form and void" more literally would read 'raging inundations and horrendous winds" 23 Declassified in Part Sanitized Approved for Release 2013/06/24 : CIA-RDP79BOO752AO00300070001-8 Copy reign long priest - Copy Declassified in Part Sanitized Approved for Release 2013/08/24 CIA-RDP79B0O752A000300070001-8 Now, through Ezra's reconstruction of Genesis, we are told many things: 1 Because of the usage of (€ tree J) ccfruit"> 'serpent 9) echerubim and other words which were glyphs in the picture language of prehistory, it is evident that the Crea- tion and Adam and Eve stories were probably originally written in the glyphs of the predominant Eastern Hemisphere language of 11,500 years ag0. This language is nearly identical to ancient Mayan, and the progenitor of many_languages, including_Oriental and Polynesian tongues, Egyptian, Greek, and Yakut: 2. Moses (and possibly Aaron) may have had access to these tablets, Or Egyptian versions of them. 3 . Neither Moses nor Aaron knew how to read the ancient language, therefore read the glyphs literally. 4. Not being able to read the symbolism of glyphs, in addition to reading them literally, Moses and Aaron and possibly Ezra) read into the Adam and Eve story the social and religious attitudes of their In that time woman was regarded as the root of all a lowly creature, her birth recorded only as an exception; and basically being the cause of man's every downfall ~a daily potential. This attitude persists in some religions even to our time. Is it any wonder that Eve was shouldered with the responsibility for the downfall of all mankind, as a result of interpretations read into the by Moses? And into Moses' reading by Ezra? Perhaps also it was read into the story by Egyptian priests before Moses' time, and passed on to him as history. 5 . The fusing of two stories (P and J versions) into one to make the story of Genesis I, II, and III may confuse "the J} man with Adam: It is possible that Adam, being only nine generations ahead of Noah, with the time span of the (( Sudan Basin Polar Era covering $,000 years, was not the J) man referred to in the creation; but his name and later (( experiences were merged with the man's" story: 24 Declassified in Part Sanitized Approved for Release 2013/06/24 CIA-RDP79BOO752AOO0300070001-8 Copy Naga; quite Naga day. sin, Naga long Copy Declassified in Part Sanitized Approved for Release 2013/08/24 : CIA-RDP79B0O752A000300070001-8 Remember, however, we are informed that Ezra dic- tated the entire history to five scribes from memory, and this work contains Genesis as we know it today: For him to recall from the archives of his mind what he did--as well as he did ~certainly bespeaks of inspiration of a high order; but it als0 appears evident that he had no knowledge of the fact that 5,000 years transpired between Genesis I and Noah 's flood. It is clear from 2 Ezdras 3:9 that Genesis T and Noah' s flood represented two inundations, how - ever, for while speaking of the two occasions, he says of Noah s flood: (( And in process of time thou brought- est the flood upon those that dwelt in the world, and de- stroyedst them_ Now; we mentioned before that the lineage of the high priests from Aaron to Ezra differs in number of genera- tions (17 or 20) and names as presented in 1 and 2 Ezdras; and both differ in names from the book of Ezra: We also find differences in the lineages from Noah to Jesus proximately 5 1 generations) in the Bible: Is it any wonder; therefore, that some generations could have been omitted in the Adam to Noah line? And the Aaron to Ezra line? And in the light of the fact that, in addition to over- whelming scientific evidence, there are countless legends in the Asia-Pacific area, handed down from the inundation of 11,500 years ago, of a creation much like that of Genesis ) } I and II, is it not possible that 'the man of the Genesis story became confused with Adam throughout the thou- sands of years; and through a succeeding tumble and inun- dation in Noah s time 6500 years The miracle actually is tbat tbe wbole story of crea- tion' ' , and of Adam and Eve,is as undistorted as it is; being 11,500 years old, it bas suffered tbrougb many debacles visited wpon its guardians in tbe intervening years: Because of the lack of resolving information, ethe man and Adam are as one in this translation-inter- pretation: 25 Declassified in Part Sanitized Approved for Release 2013/06/24 : CIA-RDP79BOO752AO00300070001-8 Copy again (ap- ago? kept Copy Declassified in Part Sanitized Approved for Release 2013/06/24 CIA-RDP79BOO752AO00300070001-8 6_ The significant glyphs given to uS by Ezra through Moses' direct reading are: Cherubims Man Fruit Rib Serpent Adam s Tree Flaming Sword Our knowledge of glyphs tells us that the tree (of symbolized a mother continent; a parent civiliza- tion thousands of years longer than ours of today. An unadorned serpent represented water, or the ocean; a serpent entwined about the tree signified that the mother continent was surrounded by water. Genesis III; 15 ac- tually describes Eve's heel on the serpent's head, showing her victory over the oceans. Cherubims_which were not pretty, plump babies; but hybrid man and beast ~were the glyphs for or foundations; or underpinnings Instead of placed in the garden of Eden, one was taken away; and a or reading of the Egyptian Book of the Dead shows that cherubims of the North; East; South, and West were taken away-_-meaning that the foundations of the mother conti- nent; in all directions, were removed or destroyed. The flaming sword was the symbol of fire and earth- quake. The fire signified what all legends of these cata- clysms call earth-fire, which is the molten layer below the earth's 60-mile thick shell breaking through to the surface during a tumble, a literal hell. It is most probably the origin of man's concept of hell, as a matter of fact. Now back to the tree: Fruit growing on that tree sym- bolized the original mankind which settled the mother continent ages before Adam and Eve. Their eating of the fruit tells us that they were descended from this original mankind of the continent. Eve eating first signifies that she was the generation after Adam, making her his daughter: His daughter! ? 26 Declassified in Part Sanitized Approved for Release 2013/06/24 CIA-RDP79B00752A000300070001-8 Copy Naga Woman sleep Naga life) lasting legs, being Naga Maya Copy Declassified in Part Sanitized Approved for Release 2013/068/24 : CIA-RDP79BOO752A000300070001-8 The glyph of the creation is even more revealing: There are three figures represented in this picture; the top figure is the face of a sleeping or dead person (there were no separate symbols for death and in Naga ~both were represented as the same) . The middle figure is shown as a male, and the bottom figure a female who is represented as the mother of all mankind: In addition, there are curved lines from the sleeping or dead person and the male middle figure to the bottom female figure: This glyph has been interpreted to mean that the middle figure, a male, was put to shown by the top and a rib (or ribs) removed from him the ribs being the curved lines) and fashioned into the bottom figure; the female mother of all mankind This fits beau- tifully with the story of Eve's creation, Adam therefore being both the male middle figure and the top figure, a sleeping (or dead) person: There is a slight hitch to this story, however: the top whether sleeping or dead, is depicted as a female! How could it be Adam, asleep, awake, dead, or alive? Moreover , in the curved lines denote parentage rather than ribs; SO, more reasonably, it appears that the top figure is a dead female, whose offspring by the male middle figure (Adam) was the bottom female figure (Eve) the mother of the Hebrews: * 27 Declassified in Part Sanitized Approved for Release 2013/06/24 0 CIA-RDP79BOO752AO00300070001-8 Copy sleep sleep; figure, figure, Naga Copy Declassified in Part Sanitized Approved for Release 2013/06/24 : CIA-RDP79B00752A000300070001-8 in essence, the story as read from the glyphs would be that Adam and who lived in the Garden of Eden in the mother continent (tree) , were descended from the original mankind (fruit) of that land, which incidentally was surrounded entirely by water (serpent around the tree) Eve was Adam'$ daughter, and he was a widower. realized that, in order to survive, they had to leave and never try to return; for the motherland was to be destroyed by a cataclysmic inundation: left; and afterward; the continent (tree) was subjected to a earthquake (flaming sword) , during which it lost its foun- dations (cherubims) and sank beneath the ocean (ser- pent) which forever afterward walked over the sunken continent (on its belly) _ So let $ review the event -two cataclysms ag0- and then apply our knowledge toward a representative translation-interpretation of Genesis I, II; and III: It may be the most accurate reading of a story written II,500 years ag0. 28 Declassified in Part Sanitized Approved for Release 2013/06/24 CIA-RDP79BOO752AOO0300070001-8 Copy So, Eve, They They fiery Copy Declassified in Part Sanitized Approved for Release 2013/08/24 0 CIA-RDP79BOO752A000300070001-8 THE EVENT 11,500 years ag0 29 Declassified in Part Sanitized Approved for Release 2013/06/24 0 CIA-RDP79B0O752A000300070001-8 Copy Copy Declassified in Part Sanitized Approved for Release 2013/068/24 : CIA-RDP79BOO752A000300070001-8 Did you ever sit down for an evening at a card table with a Iooo-piece puzzle?

There was a continent in the Atlantic Ocean area, which stretched from Iceland and England across the Atlantic to the Bahamas: The Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea did not exist they were land at that time. There was another continent in the Pacific covering an area now ringed by the Hawaiian Islands, the Gala- pagos, Easter Island, Tahiti, the Solomons, and the Caro- line Islands.

And during one of the many cataclysms that occurred during the earth's history (this one being 11,500 years ago) , the earth's lands were inundated with raging waters, and ravaged by horrendous winds; and the oceans were all dark with muddiness. And the ill wind thundered over the troubled waters also. 3_ And as the storms abated, sunlight came back to the face of the earth; as God intended: 4.

For the Lord God had not brought rain upon the earth in this region, and there was not a man to till the ground. 6. But there was this cataclysm, and great inundations arose over the earth: 7 And it was God's will that man should rise up from the earth; and the breath of life, and remain a living soul.

(Note: The next four verses are probably incorrect; with the true description locked in correct translations of Egypt's "Book of the Dead" and the missing portion of the Piri Reis map. ) 11. The first land is near the river Pison, which includes the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold; 12. And the of that land is there is bdellium and the onyx stone. 13 . And the second land is near the river Gihon: the same land which includes the whole land of Ethiopia. 14. And the third land is near the river Hiddekel: that is the land toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth land is near the river Euphrates 15. And it was in God's province that the man was Of Eden, where he lived and toiled. 16. And he was descended from the original mankind which settled that motherland. 17 . And God's design was that the man was warned: although the motherland was the source of all knowledge, both and evil, if he stay therein, surely he would die. 18. I And it was God's design that the man should not be alone, therefore a mate should be his; 19. And since God had originally created every beast of the field, and fowl of the air, and in his time Adam had named each one; 41 Declassified in Part Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/06/24 0 CIA-RDP79BOO752AO00300070001-8 Copy good gold good: good Declassified in Part Sanitized Approved for Release 2013/08/24 : CIA-RDP79BOO752A000300070001-8 20_ And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was no mate. 21. For Adam' s mate had died, after giving birth to a child of Adam; 22 . And the child of the man was a female, made in the image God intended; 23. And Adam said, this child is bone of my bone, and flesh of my flesh; and she grew into womanhood. 24. Therefore, the man was both father and mother to and she abode with him, as were one flesh: 25. And the climate there was warm, requiring little or no clothing: III: 1. I Now at the time of the beginning of this story, the oceans were in their normal state of quietness; and it was known to the woman of this story that she was not de- scended from any of the peoples of the lands which sprang from the mother continent; 2 And God's design was that the woman would learn that the people of the offspring lands would live o, 3. But the people of the motherland, from whom she had descended, would surely all die. 4 And she knew that in spite of the impending inunda - tion, she would not surely die; 5 _ For God's design was that from the day she was born, she was descended from the original mankind of the motherland, and was destined to know all, to discern both and evil: 6. And the woman, being of the motherland, and being wise and good, knew that both she and her father were 42 Declassified in Part Sanitized Approved for Release 2013/06/24 CIA-RDP79BOO752A000300070001-8 Copy air, her, they good Copy Declassified in Part Sanitized Approved for Release 2013/06/24 : CIA-RDP79BOO752A000300070001-8 descended from the original mankind of the motherland. 7 And both were wise, and had lived the life; and it was that time of the year when some clothing was needed for warmth: 8. And in the cool of those days, when they,were wonder; ing to which of the offspring lands should g0, and God's presence was felt strongly by them, 9 Adam felt God's call, 10. And said, I have heard God's warning since the sum- mer, and have feared, for I knew not where to find refuge; 11. And God's warning had come to him in the summer, as a warning to leave the land of his ancestors 12.. And the man said, the woman who is my daughter, and descended of my ancestors, gave me this knowiedge; 13. And asked What of knowledge has God given And the woman said, I am of your ancestors and inherit their wisdom; and the coming inundations of the oceans has been made known to me; 14. And God's design was that the oceans would so inun- date the lands, and drown all cattle, and all beasts of the field, and all dust, 15. And God has thus given me victory over the oceans, such that the seed of future generations is in you and me, for the oceans will drown all others: 16. And God's design was that although the inundation would greatly multiply her sorrows, she would even SO bring forth children; as her love would be for her husband; and his for her. 17. And unto Adam it was God's will that he heed the words of his daughter, and God s warning that though they be descendants of original mankind of the motherland; they should leave it, as it was destined for destruction, and were they to stay, surely they would regret it; 43 Declassified in Part Sanitized Approved for Release 2013/06/24 : CIA-RDP79BOO752AO00300070001-8 Copy they good they gift her , you? bury Copy Declassified in Part Sanitized Approved for Release 2013/06/24 : CIA-RDP79BOO752A000300070001-8 18.

And, after the inundation, as they were in a colder climate, it was God's design as part of their survival that make coats of skins, and be clothed: 22. I And it was God's design that Adam should take with him the knowledge of and evil from the motherland as he forth and left in order to 23. Therefore; in accordance with God's will, he left the garden of Eden, to survive and live from the soil where he was to g0. 24. So the man left; and the garden of Eden was subjected to a cataclysm of earthquake and fire; and the motherland lost its foundations; and sank beneath the oceans. 44 Declassified in Part Sanitized Approved for Release 2013/06/24 CIA-RDP79BOO752A000300070001-8 Copy By days, again they good live; put Copy Declassified in Part Sanitized Approved for Release 2013/08/24 : CIA-RDP79BOO752A000300070001-8 CONCLUSION India Greece Egypt . 45 Declassified in Part Sanitized Approved for Release 2013/06/24 : CIA-RDP79B00752A000300070001-8 Copy Copy Declassified in Part Sanitized Approved for Release 2013/06/24 : CIA-RDP79BOO752A000300070001-8 When Indra, King of the Gods, had destroyed the Titan who held the waters of the earth captive in his entrails, he returned to the heights of the Central Mountain with the song of the rains and running waters in his ears.

As a result of his research since 1949, Mr. Thomas has become recognized as the world's leading authority in the field of cataclysmic geology and its relationship to uniformitarian geology. In 1959 he applied his findings to the possibility of earthquake prediction, and at a seminar in November , 1959 issued the results of his studies He then accurately forecast the months, years, and locations of the major African and Chilean earthquakes of 1960, the Iranian earthquake of 1962, the Jugoslavian earthquake of 1963, and further predicted that California would have no major earthquakes for the following five years His correlation research in the fields of stratigraphy, vertebrate palaeontology, radiology, oceanography, glacio- ogly, seismology, palaeophilology, earth magnetism, an- thropology, and other related fields, has demonstrated that the cataclysmic geology theories as presented by DeLuc in 1779 and Cuvier in I8 I2 are definitely more acceptable,than they have been previously within inter- national scientific circles: Mr. Thomas' definitive efforts in integrating the various earth sciences have distinguished him as the only American today with such a specialized scientific forte: His research in palaeosciences has led to new explana- tions of such enigmas as the Pyramid of Khufu at Gizeh, the ancient cities of Tiahuanaco and Baalbek, and the statues of Easter Island: 55 Declassified in Part Sanitized Approved for Release 2013/06/24 0 CIA-RDP79BOO752AO00300070001-8 Copy 'degree giant Copy Declassified in Part Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/06/24 CIA-RDP79BOO752A000300070001-8 Supplementary Reading : Secret Cities of South America Harold T.
