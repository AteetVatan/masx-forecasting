Thu work nceofdingly claims to date from the period 3^1^96 B.m : ond its a rob ii. ic style is well in agreement with the chum. Stcondly, on regards ha nature and value.

Besides using the words Gavadkyaksha, Sutradkyakska, Pan- yiidhyaksha and Ayuktaka (V, 5) in ..the sense of a government officer, he has used the word “ Arthuchintakah ” (I, 2), professors of the Arthariastra. It may possibly refer to Kautilya among others, as the quotation preceding that word appears in the Arthasastra of Kautilya. MalliDathasuri also has in his commentaries freely quoted from the Arthasastra to explain certain technical terms used by Kalidasa, both in the Raghuvamsa and the Kurnirasambhava.

Of these quotations, the first is intended to explain the word “ Svargabhishyandavamana,” which occurs both in the Raghuvarasa and the Kumarasambhava; the second to expound the words “ nivOga ” and “ vikalpa ” ; the third “ Prnkrtivairagya ” ; the fourth “ sakyeehu yatra ” ; the fifth “ Parabhisandhana ” ; the sixth “ dandopanatacharitam ” ; and the seventh to point out the three branches of knowledge, “ tisro vidyah.” Again, in defence of hunting as a good sport for kings, Kalidasa uses in the Sakuntala almost the same words that are used by Kautilya for the same purpose : 553 «3?g?*iR- wiaR'^qi: 1 3- 3 3RRF fawn fa sj- *R 1^: II Faku.

A few of the words are evidently peculiar to works on political ■science, and the author has himself stated in the last chapter of the work that the use of the word “ Prakvti, ” in the sense of an element of sovereignty, has been his own : and has also said in VI, 1, that each sovereign state must contain seven members (ahgn), such as the king, the minister, the country, the fort, the treasury, the army, and the friend; and eight elements (prakftis) with these and the *'T KAUTJLTM*8 ARTHi&STRA enemy. Amaraeimha culls (II, 8, IT) them »uven members (rtijvun- ^Ini> «r element* (jirxkrtie), *ud to designate the enemy nr enemies lie bus not need the word pjmkrlL iSo Kautilyu mar bo credited with haring coined tho word praJcrti to designate an element of (ovtreignty, and to have extended the denotation of it so as to cover enemies also, as ‘‘prathama pt*krtLM brat inimical element; dcitlra prakfti," second inimical ale me lit; wud tytiya prakrti,” tbi.d inimical dement, mud eo on, ;tu stated by him. Likewise, Kamandaka calls (I, id. IT) them members, end uee* the word praki ti to designate those seven members mud also enemies {VIII, 4, 20, :>oj, It wourd appear, therefore, that writers ou political science before KautiJya used the word “ uiigs,” me tuber, os a general term to designate any of the seven constimenu of a state, uud hod no such general term as “prati ti" element, to denote the seven constituents as well as the inimical elements. It follows, therefor*, that the use of the word “ praktti ” in the sense of an element of a sovereign state including enemies also is s proof that the author using that word must he posterior to Kaunilya. In the Manussum, now csttuat, the word " pratrti " is used (VII, i;l6) ja ^ general tcruu, iis in Kaufilyu, and it can therefore he taken to be posterior to Kiiutilya. It follows also that KAlidtu must have been indebted to KautilyAs Arthaeastru for the political technical terms noted above, end that MulliaathasJri could find their explana¬ tion in no other political work than that of Kautilya. If thin holds good, it follows that Kalidasa must also be posterior to EnuliLjjL. Ugnyuvalkya, however, seems to use If, -Hi, 33*) the word piakrti “ us synonymous with *' at:**, " and has not extended its siiiBC like Kautilra to denote also an mimical element of a fi^verergn stute.

Hare the thr*« important points to be considered ore the stive and commission uud ominiion, if any, «n th» part of the two writHrs, While Fvs-ufilya, following the Siitro style, prefers prose to verse, nod uses words some of which ore obsolete and jx few against the rot** of Taiiini, Yagfiyuvalky# uses verse with word* modern and in accordance with the rules of Pu^ini. White Kmitilyii uses a single compound word, " nkjdiudrftpariiihatka," “ Imving a council of miruHterfl of no in>mji magnitude," Yagliyavalkyn use* two different words, *‘ akr-liiidra " and “ apannsha,"1 manning “ neither nsean," “ nor cruel.” This may bo accounted for as due tv the discontinuance of the council of ministers by the king* of hi* time or aa dq« to the copyist Laving erroneously transcribed “ parisbad" us " parusha-’’ While KflaeiJja uses the word 41 Sapsthaviifcyanu- yoga" in the technical wnoc of '* the trial of a criminal on oath,” Yigiivnvalkya interprets and uses it in the modern sens- of ** an improper oath.7' Again, while Knatitya um the word* 11 yukta/" “ a govern in cut officer " ; and " ayukla,'' ‘‘obe other than u govermuebt officer/11 a& used in the inscriptions of Aiwka.'

What still more strikingly proves the priority of the Arthft- sftsttz Ui the Sinrtis of Manu und Yagnyavalkya, as now extant, Lh the marked difference between the states of societies presented in them. The --1 nc of society portrayed in the Artkawjlra bin the main pre-Buddhistic, though Kautilya wrote long after the time of Buddha, while the 3mrtz* depict the idea) of chu Hindu society as reconstructed and reformed ‘-on sequent on its struggle for exist 4d.ew against the ulhvLQburiuuif* but just then decadent, Buddhism, The Smrbis allude to the previous esL&tene* of the aiaifi of society d *50 rib Mil by Kautilya, either by condemn Lug some of its political, social and religious practices, or by discrediting> the Arthaiistra und other 3mrtis which authormd the practices characteristic! of it. Owing partly to the influence of the highly moral and phi I at) thru pic teaching* of the Buddhists, und partly to the precepts of the Dbiirmiih^tra and tbo Yudanta of the reviving or reformed Utah* rnain^m, a number of practices and customs previously existent warn to have gradually disappeared between the birch of Buddha ood the clow of the third or fourth 'Century of the Christian era. The political practices which disappeared cIurii.this period appear tn he the institution of espionage with its evil consequence the vices uf the ha need hfo resulting iu the cold~bfoudc J murder of king*, princes, immutco and other high officers ; the evils of the pa^ port system f the taking of census of inert, women, children and 1J. 11, 13* 1. 17, lHP3th V111, I, JP3p4Pa* 1 II, 34- KAUTILYA’S ARTHASaSTRA xvii beasts the levy of a number of taxes, benevolences and special taxes to replenish empty treasuries oppressive taxes on trade ;l the exaction of religious taxes and the robbing of temple money by imposing upon the credulity and superstition of the people ;4 the confiscation of the property of the rich under the plea of embezzlement or of tiding over famine and other national calami¬ ties ;4 the slaughter of beasts on a large scale for the supply of flesh to the people, including even the Brahmans ;* state-owned drinking saloons to supply liquor to men, women, and children of all castes ;7 torture of criminals to elicit confession ;* deceitful treaties and treacherous battles;® the evils wrought by spies in creating distrust between man and man and man and woman ;f and the use of destructive gases, medicines and poisons to murder people or to render them infirm either in war or in peace.11 The social customs that fell out of practice seem to be divorce due to enmity between husband and wife j1* re-marriage of women whose husbands had long been absent abroad or had died marriage of maidens at their own option after puberty ;M marriage of a SUdra-wife by a Brahman in addition to the three wives chosen from the upper castes ;'5 flesh-eating and drinking of liquor among Brahmans the embracing of the military profession by Brahmans.17 Among religious observances, the worship of ^ aisravana, Mahakachchha, and Sankarshana, and the practices of Atharvanic witchcraft and sorcery, seem to have been given up. " These appear to be the practices and customs which Bana has succinctly condemned in the six pregnant sentences of his Kadambari quoted above. The next author in point of date who refers to \ ishnugupta is Var&hamihira. He ascribes a verse (Brhatsamhita II, 4) advocating superstitious reliance on the influence of the planets to Vishpugupta. But it does not occur in the Arthasastra, nor can it find a place in a work given to the condemnation of the auspicious or inauspicious influences of the stars. The verse runs as follows : » II, 35. 1 II, 6, 12. 16, 21 ; V, 2. 811,9; IV, 3. • II, 26. • VII, 17; X. 3. » XII, XIII. “Ill, 4. “IV, 12. “ II, 25, 26; IV, 13. “ IX, 2. 8 II, 21 ; IV, 2. 8 V, 2. * II, 25. • IV, 8. 81 XIV. “Ill, 3. >6 III, 6. “ II, 4; IV, 3.

The political uud economic iuntitutiojie Find eookl conditions described m the ArtbaK^tn are of a far oiuic advanced and conjpli¬ cated type than tboac recorded or alluded to by Hsgaathtimes about n c, and Attjka inscriptions.

As nothing in positively known regarding tbo date of Kkinaudaka, the firfit reason m iy be left out of consideration. Ths second Te-aaon /area no bettor, as there is no positive evideuce to prove or disprove that Yijhawalkya versiilud th« rules of Kaurilyu, The third is one of the akfc*t important raai&us, uud it KAUTILYA’S AKTHASA.STRA xxvii will be shown how the dates of the Arthasastra and the Smritis of Yajnavalkja and Narada can be determined on the basis of the currency system of their times beyond dispute. The question of interpolation, in the absence of a positive evidence to prove it, is a matter of personal opinion. Regarding the age of the Kamasutra, there is no evidence to disprove that it was written about the commencement of the Andhra empire. As no celebrated Indian writer or reformer of antiquity has escaped from the fate of being represented in a supernatural garb, there is no reason why Kautilya should be classed among mythic personages while Panini, Patanjali, and a host of other writers and reformers whose lives are described in no less supernatural terms, pass for historical figures. There are no accepted data to assert that alchemy, metallurgy, and industries, as described in the Arthasastra, are the phenomena of the third century a.d. and not of the fourth century B.C. Whether the author was a southerner and changed his home to the north, and whether he was a pandit or statesman, are points which have nothing to do with the question at issue* Had there been a specimen, of the style of writing of Kautilya or of a statesman, this objection would have had some bearing on the ques¬ tion at issue. There does not appear any logical necessity to compel either the author of the Arthasastra to mention the names of Chandragupta, his capital and his companions, or the author of the Mahabhashya to speak of the Arthasastra and its author, much less of Buddha and Asoka. As to the question of Kautilya speaking of his own opinion in the third person, it is an ancient custom with Indian w riters to speak of themselves in the third persoit in their literary w’orks. Even Patanjali has followed this custom. While commenting on Pacini s satra, VII, 2, 101, he mentions his view by stating “ Gonardiya aha,” 44 Gonardiya says.” Again, w'hile commenting on the introductory verse of the Pari- bhashendusekhara, in which Nagesa, the author of the work, has used his own name in the third person, Bhairavamisra says in defence of the custom as follows: “ The prohibition that no one should use one’s own name in speaking of oneself or of one’s own view is not applicable here ; for that prohibition is applicable only to those cases in which a person xxvili K A Ufl LV±\ S A P- i H ASAST KA iittompta to apeak q£ himself by using the name given to Kim hr bis father. 5 Her* Sagesa* like Gon&rdryt* iufid in the ‘fc Gonaritfyn djui/T in a YogarOdha word and not a hahu> given by bij father.

This system is stated ud follows : 4 KakaE,iia ... l Masha or Faya. St) Mashas **. ... 1 Karibbpa^a 4 Miebapaiiwi ... IS* 1 DhaoaU. KAUTILYA’S ARTH.4SASTRA XXIX 12 Dliauakaa ... ... ... 1 Suvarna 3 Suvarcias ... ... ... 1 Dinara. In the passages quoted from Katyayana it is also stated that this system of currency was in use in the Punjab. It is well known to historians that the word dinara is the same as denarius, the name of a Greek coin (264 b-c\). It goes withoutsaying that the introduc¬ tion of denarius and its sub-divisions into the north-west provinces of India was due to the Bactrian principalities, established to the west of the Indus after the departure of Alexander the Great from India. That during the time of Patanjali the currency system of 16 mashas forming a pana or karshapana was not in existence, is clearly stated in the Mahabhashya(l, 2, 3). While commenting on I, 2, 64, he says as follows : “ Vyartheshu snmanyatsiddham; Vibhinnarthesu cha samimyat- eiddham. Sarvatra asnoterakshah padyateh padah mimlteh mashah tatra kriyasamanyatsiddham. Aparastvaha pura kalpa etad .sit s hods a mashah karshipauam shodasa palah mashasamvadyah. Tatra sankhyasamanyatsiddham.” 4t The retention of only one word in a compound of many similar words differing in meaning is made possible by finding some idea common to all the different meanings. The word aksha is derived from the root ‘ as,* to pervade ; pada, from pad, to move ; masha, from ma, to measure. Here (in the several ideas or objects signified by each of the words, aksha, pada, aud masha) what is common is the root-meaning.But another (teacher) says: “ It was in times past that sixteen mashas made one karshapana, and sixteen palas one mushasamvadya. Here what is common in different meanings is to be found in number.” What is meant in the above passage is this : It is a rule (I, 2, 64) of Pariini that in forming a compound of many words which have the same form in all the numbers of any single case-ending, only one word is to be retained, whether the words mean the same or different things. Example :—Vrikshah-f- vrikshah + vrikshah = vrikshah. Rumak (son of Dasaratha) + Ramah (son of Vasudeva) 4-Ramah (son of Jaraadagni) = Ramah. Since it is possible to use a word in plural when many similar things are meant, Patanjali came to the~conclusion that the rule was unnecessary. But the difficulty lay in the case of words of different meaning, though of the same form, as in the case of aksha, pada, and masha, each meaning coins of different standard. Here, too. XXX KAUTILYA’S ARTHASASTRA taking the root meaning of the words, it is possible, says Pataljali, to find something that is common to all different ideas signified by the words similar in form. Instead of finding what is common to different ideas in the root-meaning, another teacher went so far as the number to find some identity in the conception, particularly in the case of the word masha. Formerly a karshapana meant 16 mashas ; but in the time of the teacher it meant something else (i.e. 20 mashas). Even here it is number that is common to both. Hence there is identity in meaning. It is clear from this that the Arthasastra is a work of the age when a masha equalling one-sixteenth of a karshapana was current, and that during the time of Pataljali, a masha did not mean one- sixteenth of a karshapana, but something else. The other thing it meant was probably one-twentieth of a karshapana, as stated in the Katyayana-Smriti. Whatever might be the other sense in which that word was used in the time of the Mahabhasbya, one thing is certain, that long before Pata'ijali and the other grammarian referred to by him, a masha equalling one-sixteenth of a karshapana, as stated in the Arthasastra, ceased to be current. It follows, therefore, that the Arthasastra of Kaufcilya, describing as it does the prevalence of the karshapana of sixteen mashas, must neces¬ sarily have been in existence before Patanjali; for the Arthasastra is a lifelike picture of the commercial history of the times to which it belongs, but is not, like the Smritis, devoted to the description of the currency of the Vedic times merely in considera¬ tion of its sanctity. Even the Smriti-writers could not be free from the influence which the commercial condition of their time had exerted on them. Hence it is that they are found to make use of the dinara and its sub-divisions in their rituals, instead of the Vedic satamana, salka, harita, and nishka. They could not help it, since the \r€dic currency was long extinct. Such being the case, how can it be expected that the Arthasastra’ would refer to currency of bygone ages without any atteution to that of its own times. If it had been written in the third or the fourth century a.d. it would certainly have related the currency systern]of the Sakas, Andhras or the Guptas, and never at all that referred to in the Sutras of Pacini. Hence it follows that the Arthasastra is a work of the Maurya period, and particularly, as tradition says, of the time of Chandra- guptu Maurya. The name of Chandragupta, or of any other person, however celebrated he might be. has no logical connection with a K AUTILYA'S AHTHaIASTRA literal? work meant to be or imivemt application. It w s painful truth that Indian writers eared mure for logic than for history. Regarding the d tile fence between the accounts of Mfgastbcncs and KttUyilyn, ns pointed out by 0, Stein, Dr. EernliiarU Brelocr li;u mnde a clews study of the two works and published the results of his scholarly research in two volumes under *b" title Kua'ilij/n Suidim.' l!e fays iPart I, p. i7| that the >JjElicuLi.y uf oomparunm between the two works is greatly increased by tkn fact that out of the four booJiri of Megsa then os' Indica only a fragment is available, and thntuu the other side the Anha astro in full of original terminology bristling with philological difficult! as.

What, however, must be borne in mind is that, while our knowledge of India makes a halt before the Indus, we should not think that India is therefore outside the world. The more we free ourselves from the prepossessed ideas, the greater is the impetus given to the advance of our knowledge of Indian history. First, if we have to get accession to the great stream of time’s history, if the Indian problem is to be also the problem of the world’s history, if research into Iudian history is to be promoted by the knowledge of the world’s historical method, in short, if the dam, dexterously set up, is forcibly broken asunder, then alone will the flowing stream fertilize the life in that province. To the time in which it is evolved the methods of classical philology on the rising knowledge have to be employed, and all other influences excluded. Only in the intervention of the results of our thousand years’ know¬ ledge, our great inheritance of antiquity, can lie the solution of our proposition relating to the Orient.” I have great pleasure in expressing my thankfulness to Mr. Thos. Gould, Manager of the Wesleyan Mission Press, and Mr. F. McD. Tomkinson, the Assistant Manager, for going through the proof and for the neat get-up and quick despatch of the work. Mysore, 5th August, 1929. R. Shamasastry. PREFACE TO THE FOURTH EDITION The copies of Kautilya’s Arthasastra of the third edition were sold out long before. And there was a continuous demand for them for well over eight years. The sudden demise of my father on the 23rd January of 1944 left this stupendous responsibility of publish¬ ing the fourth edition on me, his only son. I being just a boy at the time of this unhappy incident had to defer this work for a suitable time. Now, herewith, I have tried my best to present to my father's patrons and readers the fourth edition of this Kautilya’s Arthasastra. But for certain trivial corrections of spellings and head lines there has been no change whatsoever in the text when compared to the third edition. I have taken all possible precautions to ensure the faithful reproduction of the third edition. As for the immense popularity of this book in U. S. A. and in continental countries, the steady stream of demands for the supply of this book is a concrete proof. Time and again eminent scholars are praising the great worth of this book. A few opinions of this book have been added to in the tail end. I am sure that this book shall be of immense help to all students of ancient history. For the publication of this fourth edition shortage of paper and other printing materials were the main cause of delay. Anyhow by the direct and indirect co-operation of many of my friends, this book is presented to the public once again. In this connection my thanks are specially due to Sri. G. R. Dasappa, Proprietor, Sri Raghuveer Printing Press, whose indefatigable energy is responsible for the neat and fine get-up of this book. Thanks are no less due to Sri. M. Venkata Rau who did creditable proof-reading. Asutosh Mansion ” Viceroy Road, Chamundipuram, MYSORE SHAMASASTRY SrINIVAS. Mysore^ 16th August Jpjr. CONTENTS Introductory Not*, by Dr. J. F.

BOOK XV —The Plan of a Treatise Paragraphical divisions of this treatise. Such are the contents of this science. There are on the whole ~ 15 books, 150 chapters, 180 sections and 6,000 slokas.1 This Sastra,5 bereft of undue enlargement and easy to grasp and understand, has been composed by Kautilya in words the meaning of which has been definitely settled. [Thus ends Chapter I, “ Life of a King," in Book I, “ Concern¬ ing Discipline ” of the Arthasastra of Kautilya.] CHAPTER II The End of Sciences ;Determination of the Place of Anvikshaf.i Anvlkshaki,* the triple Vedas (Trayi), Varta4 (agriculture, cattle- breeding and trade), and Danda-Niti (science of government) are what are called the four sciences. The school of Manu (Manava) hold that there are only three sciences: the triple Vedas, Varta and the science of government, inasmuch as the science of Anvlkshaki is nothing but a special branch of the Vedas. The school of Bvibaspati say that there aie only two sciences : Varta and the science of government, inasmuch as the triple Vedas are merely an abridgment (Samvarana, pretext ?) for a man experienced in affairs temporal (Lokay&trlvidah). The school of Usanas declare that there is only one science, and that the science of government; for, they say, it is in that science that all other sciences have their origin and end. Bat Kautilya holds that four, and only four, are the sciences ; wherefore it is from these sciences that all that concerns righteous¬ ness and wealth is learnt, therefore they are so called. 1 Thirfcv-two syllabled make one sloka. In Chap. VIII of his Dasakum&ra- charitra, Dandi has elso stated that the extent of the Dandanlti abridged by Vishnugnpfca is 6,000 sloka3. * This is in sloka-metre. * See below. 4 /See Chapter IV, Book I. 6 KAtJjJXTA'S AETIIASa^TRA Ajgrikshnkl oompriftw feho Philosophy of SdufckyA, Yqgn, and Lokayutu f Atfiwiaiu ?J.

Absence of discrepancy (avipratipatti) in the perception of sound, touch, colour, flavour, and scent by means of the ear, the skin, the eyes, the tongue, and the nose, is what is meant by the restraint of the organs of sense. Strict observance of the precepts of sciences also means the same; for the sole aim of all the sciences is nothing but restraint of the organs of sense. Whosoever is of reverse character, whoever has not his organs of sense under his control, will soon perish though possessed of the whole earth bounded by the four quavters. 1 See Chap.

And in accordance with the difference in the working capacity. Having divided the spheres of their powers and having definitely taken into consideration the place and time where and when they have to work, such persons shall be employed not as councillors (mantrirah), but as ministerial officers (amatyah).1 [Thus ends Chapter VIII, “ Creation of Ministers,” in Book I, “ Concerning Discipline” of the Artha4astra of Kaufcilya.] CHAPTER IX The Creation of Councillors and Priests Native, born of high family, influential, well trained in arts, 15 POS8es8ed °f foresight, wise, of strong memory, bold, eloquent, skilful, intelligent, possessed of enthusiasm, dignity and endurance, pure in character, affable, firm in loyal devotion, endowed with excellent conduct, strength, health and bravery, free from procrastination and ficklemindedness, affectionate, and free from such qualities as excite hatred and enmity—these are the qualifications of a ministerial officer (amatyasampat).* Such as are possessed of one-half or one-quarter of the above qualifications come under middle and low ranks. Of these qualifications, native birth and influential position shall be ascertained from reliable persons; educational qualifications b ilpa) from professors of equal learning ; theoretical and practical knowledge, foresight, retentive memory, and affability shall be tested from successful application in works; eloquence, skilfulness and flashing intelligence from power shown in narrating stories (kathayogeshu, i.e., in conversation); endurance, enthusiasm, and bravery in troubles ; purity of life, friendly disposition, and loyal devotion by frequent association ; conduct, strength, health, dignity, and freedom from indolence and ficklemindedness shall be ascer¬ tained from their intimate friends ; and affectionate and philan¬ thropic nature by personal experience. The works of a king may be visible,, invisible (paroksha), and inferential. 1 In sloka-metre. * Ka. IV 25-38. 15 KAUTILYA’S ARTHASASTRA That which he sees is visible ; and that which he is taught by another is invisible ; and inference of the nature of what is not accomplished from what is accomplished i3. inferential. As works do not happen to be simultaneous, are various in form, and pertain to distant and different localities, the king shall, in view of being abreast of time and place, depute his ministers to carry them out. Such is the work of ministers. Him whose family and character are highly spoken of, who is well educated in the Vedas and the six Angas, is skilful in reading portents, providential or accidental, is well versed in the science of government, and who is obedient and who can prevent calamities, providential or human, by performing such expiatory rites as are prescribed in the Atharvaveda, the king shall employ as high priest. As a student his teacher, a son his father, and a servant his* master the king shall follow him. That Kshatriya breed which is brought up by Brahmans, is charmed with the counsels of good councillors, and which faithfully jQ follows the precepts of the Fastras, becomes invincible and attains success though unaided with weapons.1 [Thus ends Chapter IX, “The Creation of Councillors and Priests,” in Book I, “ Concerning Discipline ” of the Arthasiistra of Kautilya.] CHAPTER X Ascertaining by Temptations Purity or Impurity in the Character of Ministers Assisted by his prime minister (mantri) and his high priest, the king shall, by offering temptations, examine the character of ministers (amatya) appointed in government departments of ordinary nature. The king shall dismiss a priest who, when ordered, refuses to teach the Vedas to an outcast3 person or to officiate in a sacrificial performance (apparently) undertaken by an outcaste person (a>ajya).

Having encouraged such a spy with honour and money rewards, the minister shall tell him, “ Sworn to the king and myself, thou shalt inform us of whatever wickedness thou findesfc in others.” One who is initiated in asceticism and is possessed of foresight and pure character is a recluse.1 This spy, provided with much money and many disciples, shall carry on agriculture, cattle-rearing, and trade (vartakarma) on the lands allotted to him for the purpose. Out of the produce and profits thus acquired, he shall provide all ascetics with subsistence, clothing and lodging, and send on espionage such among those under his protection as are desirous to earn a livelihood (vrittikama), ordering each of them to detect a particular kind of crime committed in connection with the king’s wealth, and to report of it when they come to receive their subsistence and wages. All the ascetics (under the recluse} shall severally send their followers on similar errands. A cultivator, fallen from his profession, but possessed of foresight and pure character, is termed a householder spy. This spy shall carry on the cultivation of lands allotted to him for the purpose, and maintain cultivators, etc.—as before.* A trader, fallen from his profession, but possessed of foresight and pure character, is a merchant spy. This spy shall carry on the jg manufacture of merchandise on lands allotted to him for the purpose, etc.—as before. A man with shaved head (mui^cla) or braided hair (jatila) and desirous to earn livelihood is a spy under the guise of an ascetic practising austerities. Such a spy surrounded by a host of disciples with shaved head or braided hair may take his abode in the suburbs of a city, and pretend as a person barely living on a handful of vegetables or meadow grass (yavasamushti) taken once in the interval of a month or two, but he may take in secret his favourite foodstuffs (gudhamishtamaharam). Merchant spies pretending to be his disciples may worship him as one possessed of preternatural powers. His other disciples may wddely proclaim that “this ascetic is an accomplished expert of pre¬ ternatural powers.99 Regarding those persons who, desirous of knowing their future, throng to him, he may, through palmistry, foretell such future 1 May we not trace the origin of modern Bairagis to this institution of spies ? * That is, send spies as the recluse. 19 KAUTILYA'S ARTHASASTRA events as he can ascertain by the nods and signs of his disciples • (angavidyaya eishyasamjnabhischa) concerning the works of high¬ born people of the country—viz. small profits, destruction by fire, fear from robbers, the execution of the seditious, rewards for the good, forecast of foreign affairs (videsa pravrittivijfklnam), saying, “ This will happen to day, that to-morrow, and that this king will do.’* Such assertions of the ascetic his disciples shall corroborate (by adducing facts and figures). He shall also foretell not only the rewards which persons possess¬ ed of foresight, eloquence, and bravery are likely to receive at the hands of the king, but also probable changes in the appointments of ministers. The king's minister shall direct his affairs in conformity to the forecast made by the ascetic. He shall appease with offer of wealth and honour those who have had some well-known cause to be dis¬ affected, and impose punishments in secret on those who are for no reason disaffected or who are plotting against the king. Honoured by the king with awards of money and titles, these five institutes of espionage (samsthah) shall ascertain the purity of character of the king’s servants.1 [Thus ends Chapter XI, “ The Institution of Spies,” in Book I, f< Concerning Discipline ” of the Arthasastra of Kautilya.] CHAPTER XII The Institution of Spif.s • Creation of Wandering Spies Those orphans (asambandhinah) who are to be necessarily fed by 2Q the state and are put to study science, palmistry (angavidya), sorcery (mayagata), the duties of the various orders of religious life, legerdemain (jambhakavidya), and the reading of omens and augury (antara-chakra\ are classmate spies, or spies learning by social intercourse (samsargavidyasatripah). Such brave desperados of the country who, reckless of their own life, confront elephants or tigers in fight mamly for the purpose of earning money are termed fire-brands or fiery spies (tikshija). 1 In sloka-metre. 20 KAUTILYA’S ARTHASASTRA Those who have no trace of filial affection left in them and who are very cruel and indolent are poisoners (rasada). A poor widow of Brahman caste, very clever, and desirous to earn her livelihood, is a woman ascetic (parivrajika). Honoured in the king’s harem, such a woman shall frequent the residences of the king’s prime ministers (mahamdtrakullni). The same rule shall apply to women with shaved head (mui^da), as well as to those of Sudra caste. All these are wandering spies (sancharah). Of these spies, those who are of good family, loyal, reliable, well-trained in the art of putting on disguises appropriate to countries and trades, and possessed of knowledge of many languages and arts, shall be sent by the king to espy in his own country the movements of his ministers, priests, commanders of the army, the heir-apparent, the door-keepers, the officer-in-charge of the harem, the magistrate (praoastyi), the collector-general (samihartfi), the chamberlain (sannidhatyi), the commissioner (pralcshtyi), the city constable (nayaka), the officer-in-charge of the citv (paura), the superintendent of transactions (vyavaharika), the superintendent of manufactories (kamiantika), the assembly of councillors (mantri- parishad), heads of department (adhyakshih), the commissary- general (dandapala), and officers in charge of fortifications, boun¬ daries, and wild tracts. Fiery spies, such as are employed to hold the royal umbrella, vase, fan, and shoes, or to attend at the throne, chariot, and conveyance shall espy the public character (bihyam chiram) of these (officers). Classmate spies shall convey this information (i.e. that gathered by the fiery spies) to the institutes of espionage (samsth svar- payeyuh). Poisoners, such as a sauce-maker (sQda), a cook (aralika), procurer of water for bathing (snapaka), shampooer, the spreader of 2j bed (astaraka), a barber (kalpaka), toilet-maker (pras.idaku), a water-servant; servants such as have taken the appearance of a hump-backed person, a dwarf, a pigmy (kirata), the dumb, the deaf, the idiot, the blind ; artisans such as actors, dancers, s:ngers, players on musical instruments, buffoons, and a bard ; as well as women, shall espy the private character of these officers. A mendicant woman shall convey this information to the institute of espionage. RAUf ILYA’S AUTIIAsiSTIU 21 The immediate officers of the institutes of espionage (sainst-h^ 1U1 by making uaci of mgnis nr writing (^imj la- ftp ibhih), fret their own spies in motion (to ascertain the validity of ike i n fo rmation}.

Fed by this payment, kings took upon them- 22 selves the responsibility of maintaining the safety and security of their subjects (yogakshemavahah), and of being answerable for the sins of their subjects when the principle of levying just punishments and taxes has been violated. Hence hermits, too, provide1 the king with one-sixth of the grains gleaned by them, thinking that ‘ it is a tax payable to him who protects us. * It is the king in whom the duties of both Indra (the rewarder) and Yama (the punisher) are blended, and he is a visible dispenser of punish¬ ments and’rewards (heda-prasada); whoever disregards kings will be visited with divine punishments, too. Hence kings shall never be despised.” Thus treacherous opponents of sovereignty shall be silenced. Spies shall also know the rumours prevalent in the state. Spies with shaved heads or braided hair shall ascertain whether there prevails content or discontent among those who live upon the grains, cattle, and gold of the king, among those who supply the same (to the king) in weal or woe, those who keep under restraint a disaffect- ed.relative of the king or a rebellious district, as well as those who drive away an invading enemy or a wild tribe. The greater the con¬ tentment of such persons, the more shall be the honour shown to them; while those who are disaffected shall be ingratiated by rewards or conciliation ; or dissension may be sown among them so that they may alienate themselves from each other, from a neigh¬ bouring enemy, from a wild tribe, or from a banished or imprisoned prince. Failing this measure, they may be so employed in collecting fines and taxes as to incur the displeasure* of the people. Those who are inebriated with feelings of enmity may be put down by punish¬ ment in secret or by making them incur the displeasure of the whole country. Or, having taken the sons and wives of such treacherous persons under state protection, they may be made to live in mines, lest they may afford shelter to enemies. Those that are angry, those that are greedy, those that arc alarmed, as well as those that despise the king are the instruments 2^ of enemies. Spies under the guise of astrologers and tellers of omens and augury shall ascertain the relationship of such persons with each other and with foreign kings. 1 Xivapanti, make a sacrificial offering of one-sixth of the grains (Meyer). 24 KAUTILYA’S ARTHASASTRA Honours and rewards shall be conferred upon those that are contented, while those that are disaffected shall be brought round by conciliation, by gifts, or by sowing dissension, or by punishment. Thus in his own state a wise king shall guard factions among his people, friendly or hostile, powerful or powerless, against the intrigue of foreign kings.1 [Thus ends Chapter XIII, “ Protection of Parties for or against One's Own Cause in One's Own State," in Book I, “ Concerning Discipline " of the Arthasastra of Kautilya.] CHAPTER XIV TV inning Over Factions for or against an Enemy's Cause in an Enemy’s State Protection of parties for, or against, one's own cause in one's own state has been dealt with. Similar measures in connection with parties in a foreign state are to be treated of. Those who are deluded with false promise of large rewards ; those of whom one party, though equally skilful as another party in artistic work or in turning out productive or beneficial works, is slighted by bestowing larger rewards on its rival party; those who are harassed by courtiers (Vallabhavaruddhah); those who are invited to be slighted; those who are harassed by banishment; those who, in spite of their large outlay of money, have failed in their undertakings ; those who are prevented from the exercise of their rights or from taking possession of their inheritance; those who have fallen from their rank and honours in government service; those who are shoved to the corner by their own kinsmen; those whose women are violently assaulted ; those who are thrown in jail; those who are punished in secret ; those who are warned of their misdeeds ; those whose property has been wholly confiscated ; those who have long suffered from imprisonment; those whose relatives are banished—all these come under the group of provoked persons. He who has fallen a victim to misfortune by his own misdeeds ; he who is offended (by the king) ; he whose sinful deeds are brought to light; he who is alarmed at the award of punishment on 1 In sloka-metre. KAlTffLYA'S AKTHAi\STPtA 25 a man of like guilt; he whose land* h*v« been rnnfi seated ; he who*© rebellious spirit is pot dawn by coercive measures ; he who, u> n Gdperintundent of nil government departments, has suddenly aimu*©rl a h\r^ am*>11111 of wealth ; lie who, ns a relative of such a rich man, sl!. j ! i■ to inherit his wealth ; lio who is ditiliked by thr kin;; ; and he who hates the king—all these come under t he group of persona alarmed* llti who is, impoverished ; lie who has I©st much wealth; he who ia niggardly ; he who ia addicted to evil propensities : and he who is gg engaged in dangerous transactions—nil these constitute the group of ambitious penkrtie.

Of thaw, ha who dings to n particular faction shall be so deluded by spies with shaved head or braided hair fts to beEftvc that ho is intriguing with lhat party. Partisans umlar provocation, for example, may be won over by telling that tL Jusl n* an pliant in rut and mounted over by a driver under intoxiration tramples under its foot whatever it comes across, an this king, dispossessed nf the eye of ^vinnee, blindly attempts to oppress both citizens and country people ; it is possible to rest rain him by setting up w rival elephant ngninst him ; go have forbearance enough (to wait)." liili'cwiw alarmed persons may be won over by telling that 41 Just ar o hidden snake bite* and twits poison over whatever alarms itr $o this king, apprahemiv© of danger from thee, will ere long emit the poison of hh resentment on thee i ao thou may cat better go elfiowhorc.” Similarly ambitious perwonH may he won over by telling that 11 Jnnfc as * cow T©ared by dog-k©ftpH?rB gives milt to dugsK but not to Brahman*. so this king gives milk (rewards) to those who an: devoid of valour, foresight, eloquence and bravery, but not to those who are poescb’icd Of noble character: so the other king, who is poss£A*t-d f?f power to di.-criiulnute men from men, may be courted." lu like fnaonnr haughty pnraotiH may be won over by telling that "Must us a rviiervuir of water belonging to Chltajula* ifl serviceable only to CbfimjjiW. hut nut to others flO this king of low* birth confers his patronage only on lawdinru people, but not on Ary*> KAUTILYA’S arthasastra like thee; so the other king, who is possessed of power to distin¬ guish between men and men, may be courted.” All these disaffected persons, when acquiescing to the above proposals, may be made under a solemn compact (panakarmapa) to 26 form a combination together with the spies to achieve their end.' Likewise friends of a foreign king may also be won over by means of persuasion and rewards, while implacable enemies may be brought round by sowing dissensions, by threats, and by pointing out the defects of their master. (Thus ends Chapter XIV, “ Winning Over Factions for or against an Enemy’s Cause in an Enemy’s State,” in Book I, “ Con¬ cerning Discipline ” of the Arthasastra of Kautilya.] CHAPTER XV The Business of Council Meeting Having gained a firm hold on the affection of both local and foreign parties, both in his own and enemy’s state, the king shall proceed to think of administrative measures. All kinds of administrative measures are preceded by delibera¬ tions in a well-formed council. The subject matter of a council shall be entirely secret, and deliberations in it shall be so carried that even birds cannot see them; for it is said that the secrecy of counsels was divulged by parrots, minas, dogs and other low creatures of mean birth. Hence without providing himself with sufficient safeguard against disclosure, he shall never enter into deliberations in a council. Whoever discloses counsels shall be torn to pieces. The disclosure of counsels may be detected by observing changes in the attitude and countenance of envoys, ministers, and masters. Change in conduct is change in attitude (ingitamanyathS- vrittih); and observation of physical appearance is countenance (akritigrahanamakarah). Maintenance of the secrecy of a council matter, and keeping guard over officers that have taken part in the deliberation over it (shall be strictly observed) tiU the time of starting the work so considered approaches. * In Uoka-metre till the dose of the ohapter. KAUJILYA'S AR' ;astra 27 Carelessness, intoxication, talking in sleep, love, and other evil 2y habits of councillors, are the causes of the betrayal of counsels. Whoever is of hidden nature or is disregarded will disclose counsels. Hence steps shall be taken to safeguard counsels against such dangers. Disclosure of counsels is advantageous to persons other than the king and his officers. “Hence,” says Bharadvaja, “the king shall singly deliberate over secret matters ^fortnmisters have their own ministers, and these latter.some of their own ; this kind of successive line of ministers tends to the_discio$iire of counsels. Hence no outside person shall know anything of the work which the king has in view. Only those who are employed to carry it out shall know it, either when it is begun or when accomplished.”* No deliberation,” says Viiablksha, “ made by a single person will be successful; the nature of the work which a sovereign has to do is to be inferred from the consideration of both the visible and invisible causes. The perception of what is not, or cannot be seen, the conclusive decision of whatever is seen, the clearance of doubts as to whatever is susceptible of two opinions, and the inference of the whole when only a part is seen—all this is possible of decision only bv ministers. Hence he shall sit at deliberation with persons of wide intellect. “ He shall despise none, but hear the opinions of all. A wise man shall make use of even a child’s sensible utterance.”1 This is,” says Parlsara, “ ascertaining the opinions of others, but not keeping counsels. He shall ask his ministers for their opinion on a work similar to the one he has in view, telling them that * this is the work ; it happened thus ; what is to be done if it will turn out thus and he shall do as they decide. If it is done thus, both the ascertainment of opinions and maintenance of secrecy can be attained.” Not so,” says PUuna, “ for ministers, when called for their opinions regarding a distant undertaking, or an accomplished or an 2g unaccomplished work, either approach the subject with in¬ difference or give their opinions half-heartedly. This is a serious defect. Hence he shall consult such persons as are believed to be capable of giving decisive opinion regarding those works about 1 in iloka-metre.

Hence it is better to make a prince live with his maternal relations. ” “ This, ” says Vatavyadhi, “ is akin to the position of a flag (dhvajasthanainetat): for as in the case of Aditi and Kausika. the prince’s maternal relations may, unfurling this flag, go on begging. Hence princes may be suffered to dissipate their lives by sensual excesses (gramyadharma) inasmuch as revelling sons do not dislike their indulgent father. ” " This, ” says Kautilya, “ is death in life ; for no sooner is a royal family with a prince or princes given to dissipation attacked, than it perishes like a worm-eaten piece of wood. Hence when the queen attains the age favourable for procreation, priests shall offer to Indra and Brihaspati the requisite oblations. When she .is big with a child, the king shall observe the instructions of midwifery with regard to gestation and delivery. After delivery, the priests shall perform the prescribed purificatory ceremonials. When the prince attains the necessary age, adepts shall train him under proper discipline. ” “ Any one of the classmate spies,’’ say (politicians known as) Ambhiyas, “ may allure the prince towards hunting, gambling, liquor, and women, and instigate him to attack his own father and snatch the reins of government in his own hands. Another spy shall prevent him from such acts. ” “ There can be, ” says Kautilya, “ no greater crime or sin than making wicked impressions on an innocent mind ; just as 2^ a fresh object is stained with whatever it is brought in close association, so a prince with fresh mind is apt to regard as scientific injunctions all that he is told of. Hence he shall be taught only of righteousness and of wealth (artha) but not of unrighteousness and of non-wealth. Classmate spies shall be so courteous towards him as to say ‘ thine are we.’ When under the temptation of youth he turns his eye towards women, impure women under the disguise of Aryas shall, at night and in lonely places, terrify him ; when fond of liquor, he shall be terrified by making him drink such liquor as is adulterated with narcotics (yOgapana); when fond of gambling, he shall be terrified by spies under the disguise of fraudulent persons; when fond of hunting, he shall be terrified by spies under the disguise of highway 3 31 KAUT ELYA'S ARTHAiiSTBA mbbtra; and when desirous of attacking hi* own father, bn nWl, ondar the pretence of Compliance, he gradually perauudud nf the evil consequences of flitch Attempt*, by telling : a king u not mode by a mori* wish ; failure of thy attempt- will brine about thv own Hi^Athp sacc^ makea thflfl fail into hell and mtuwu tha people to lumezrt (fur thy fat her] nod destroy the only Hod (tkali'ditava- dhuKcha, *,*> thyeelfj,Tr W hvn a king bus an only son who is cither dr-void of worldly pleasures or is a favourite a hi Id f the king uiv keep him under ejieLEEi-".

The superintendent of elephant forests with his retinue of forest guards shall not only maintain the upkeep of the forests, but also acquaint himself with all passages for entrance into, or exit from, such of them as are mountainous or boggy or contain rivers or lakes. Whoever kills an elephant shall be put to death. Whoever brings in the pair of tusks of an elephant, dead from natural causes, shall receive a reward of four-and-a-half panas. Guards of elephant forests, assisted by those who rear elephants, those who enchain the legs of elephants, those who guard the boundaries, those who live in forests, as well as by those who nurse elephants, shall, with the help of five or seven female elephants to help in tethering wild ones, trace the whereabouts of herds of elephants by following the course of urine and dungs left by elephants and along forest tracts covered over with branches of BhallatakI (Semicarpus Anacardium), and by observing the spots where elephants slept or sat before or left dungs, or where they had just destroyed the banks of rivers or lakes. They shall also precisely ascertain whether any mark is due to the movements of elephants in herds, of an elephant roaming single, of a stray elephant, of a leader of herds, of a tusker, of a rogue elephant, of an elephant in rut, of a young elephant, or of an elephant that has escaped from the cage. Experts in catching elephants shall follow the instructions given to them by the elephant doctor (aulkastha), and catch such elephants as are possessed of auspicious characteristics and good character. The victory of kings (in battles) depends mainly upon elephants ; for elephants, being of large bodily frame, are capable not only to destroy the arrayed army of an enemy, his fortifications and encampments, but also to undertake works that are dangerous to life. Elephants bred in countries, such as Kalinga, Anga, Karfisa and the east are the best; those of the Dasirija afid western countries are of middle quality ; and those of Saurashtra and Panchajana countries are of low quality. The might and energy of all can, however, be improved by suitable training.

CHAPTER IV Buildings within the Fort Demarcation of the ground inside the fort shall be made first by opening three royal roads from west to east and three from south, to north. The fort shall contain twelve gates, provided with both a land and water way and a secret passage. Chariot roads, royal roads, and roads leading to dronamukha, sthfmlya, country parts, and pasture grounds shall each be four dandas (24 feet) in width. Road leading to sayOnlya {?), military stations (vyuha), burial or cremation grounds, and to villages shall be eight damlas in width. Roads to gardens, groves, and forests shall be four dandas. Roads leading to elephant forests shall be two dandas. Roads for chariots shall be five aratnis (7i feet). Roads for gg cattle shall measure four aratnis; and roads for .minor quadrupeds and men two aratnis. Royal buildings shall be constructed on strong grounds. In the midst of the houses of the people of all the four castes and to the north from the centre of the ground inside the fort, the king’s palace, facing either the north or the east shall, as described elsewhere (Chapter XX, Book I), be constructed, occupying one-ninth of the whole site inside the fort. Royal teachers, priests, sacrificial place, water reservoir and ministers shall occupy sites east by north to the palace. Royal kitchen, elephant stables, and the store-house shall be situated on sites east by south. On the eastern side, merchants trading in scents, garlands, grains, and liquids, together with expert artisans and. the people of Kshatriya caste shall have their habitations. The treasury, the accountants’ office, and various manufactories (karmanishadyascha) shall be situated on sites south by east. The store-house of forest produce and the arsenal shall be con¬ structed on sites south by west. To the south, the superintendents of the city, of commerce, of 4* 54 KAUTILYA’S ARTHASASTRA manufactories, and of the army as well as those who trade in cooked rice, liquor, and flesh, besides prostitutes, musicians, and the people of Vaisya caste shall live. To the west by south, stables of asses, camels, and working house. To the west by north, stables of conveyances and chariots. To the west, artisans manufacturing worsted threads, cotton threads, bamboo-mats, skins, armours, weapons, and gloves, as well as the people of Sudra caste, shall have their dwellings. To the north by west, shops and hospitals. To the north by east, the treasury and the stables of cows and horses. To the north, the royal tutelary deity of the city, ironsmiths, artisans working on precious stones, as well as Brahmans shall reside. In the several corners, guilds and corporations of workmen shall reside. In the centre of the city, the apartments of gods, such as gg Aparajita, Apratihata, Jayanta, Vaijayanta, Siva, Vaisrava^a, Asvina (divine physicians), and the abode of Goddess Madira (Sri Madiragrham) shall be situated.1 In the corners, the guardian deities of the ground shall be appropriately set up. Likewise the principal gates, such as Brihma, Aindra, Yamya, and Sainapatya shall be constructed ; and at a distance of 100 bows (dhanus = 96 ahgulas) from the ditch (on the counterscarp side), places of worship and pilgrimage, groves and buildings shall be constructed. Guardian deities of all quarters shall also be set up in quarters appropriate to them. Either to the north or the east, burial or cremation grounds shall be situated ; but that of the people of the highest caste shall be to the south (of the city). Violation of this rule shall be punished with the first amercement. Heretics and Cha^dhlas shall live beyond the burial grounds. Families of workmen may in any other way be provided with sites befitting their occupation and field work. Besides working in flower gardens, fruit gardens, vegetable ‘gardens, and paddy fields allotted to them, they (families) shall collect grains and merchandise in abundance as authorised. 1 The worship of the Asvins ami Vaisravana seems to have been prevalent at the time of this w >rk. 55 KAUTILYA’S ARTHASASTRA There shall be a water well for every ten houses. Oils, grains, sugar, salt, medicinal articles, dry or fresh veget¬ ables, meadow grass, dried flesh, haystock, firewood, metals, skins, charcoal, tendons (snayu), poison, horns, bamboo, fibrous garments, strong timber, weapons, armour, and stones shall also be stored (in the fort) in such quantities as can be enjoyed for years together without feeling any want. Of such collection, old things shall be replaced by new ones when received. Elephants, cavalry, chariots, and infantry shall each be officered with many chiefs, inasmuch as chiefs, when many, are under the fear of betrayal from each other and scarcely liable to the insinuations and intrigues of an enemy. The same rule shall hold good with the appointment of boundary guards, and repairers of fortifications. Never shall Bahirikas who are dangerous to the well-being of cities and countries be kept in forts. They may either be thrown in country parts or compelled to pay taxes.1 [Thus ends Chapter IV, “ Buildings within the Fort,” in Book II, “The Duties.of Government Superintendents” of the Arthasastra of Kaubilya.

Having dug up a square well, not too deep to be moist with water, having paved both the bottom and the sides with slabs of gg stone, he shall, by using strong timber, construct in that well a cage-like underground chamber of three storeys high, the topmost being on a level with the surface of the ground, with many compartments of various design, with floor plastered with small stones, with one door, with a movable staircase and solemnised with the presence of the guardian deity. Above this chamber, the treasury house closed on both sides, In sluka-motre. 56 KAUTILYA’S ARTHASASTRA with projecting roofs and extensively opening into the store-house, shall be built of bricks. He may employ outcaste men (abhityakta-purusha)1 to build at the extreme boundary of the kingdom a palatial mansion to hold substantial treasure against dangers and calamities. The trading-house shall be a quadrangle enclosed by four buildings with one door, with pillars built of burnt bricks, with many compartments, and with a row of pillars on both sides kept apart. The store-house shall consist of many spacious rooms, and enclose within itself the store-house of forest produce separated from it by means of walls and connected with both the underground chamber and the armoury. The court (dharmasthiya) and the office of the ministers (mahamatrlya) shall be built in a separate locality. Provided with separate accommodation for men and women kept apart, and with many compartments well-guarded, a jail shall also be constructed. All these buildings shall be provided with halls (Aala), pits (khata—privy [?]), water well, bathroom,5 remedies against fire and poison, with cats, mongooses, and with necessary means to worship the guardian gods appropriate to each. In (front of) the store-house, a bowl (kunc]a) with its mouth as wide as an aratni (24 ahgulas) shall be set up as rain-gauge (varshamana). Assisted by experts having necessary qualifications and provided with tools and instruments, the chamberlain shall attend to the business of receiving gems, either old or new, as well as raw materials of superior or inferior value. In cases of deception in gems, both the deceiver and the abettor shall be punished with the highest amercement; in the case of superior commodities, they shall be punished with the middlemost amercement; and in that of commodities of inferior value, they shall • be compelled not only to restore the same, but also pay a fine equal to the value of the articles. He shall receive only such gold coins as have been declared to be pure by the examiner of coins. Counterfeit coins shall be cut into pieces. 1 The word may mean criminal*, who after the completion of the building might be put to death to safeguard the secrecy of the plan. * See Chap.

Game forests, timber forests, and elephant forests are forests. Cow's, buffaloes, goats, sheep, asses, camels, horses, and mules come under the head of herds. Land and water ways are the roads of traffic. All these form the body of income (ayasarlram). Capital (inula), share (bhaga;, premia (vyaji), parigha* (?), fixed taxes (klrpta), premia on coins (rupika*), and fixed fines (ataya) are several forms of revenue (ayamukha, i.e- the mouth from which income is to issue).

H^hall also pay ‘attention to the work in hand (karaniya), the work accomplished (siddham), part of a work in hand ^ (sesha), receipts, expenditure, and net balance. The business of upkeeping the government (samsthanara). the routine work (pracharah),' the collection of necessaries of life, 1 The meaning seems to l>c this— 1.

The dark fortnight of ^ravana is made to a^nsist of 14 days, as it is the second seventh after the light fortnight of Pnshya, the first seventh. This with the 180 days of the three other seasons makes the lunar year consist of 354 days. See Chap. XX. Book II. The Nidanaentra V, 11. 12, seems to count months of 30 and 29 days alternately; see ray Vcdic Calendar published in the Indian Antiquary, Vol. XLI, 1912. Dr. Fleet suggests a translation of the passage as follows: “ The King's year, the month, the fortnight, and the day (which begins at) sunrise; the third and seventh fortnights of the rainy season the winter, and the hot weather, are deficient bv one day (i. e. have only 14 days); the other (fortnights) are full (i.e. consist of todays); the intercalated month stands apart separately (and always has 30 days, while the others have 30 and 29 alternately); such is time.” Thus Dr. Fleet takes Vpuhta as an epithet qualifying dicata ; but the use of the word in neuter gender is against such a construction. J*or the use of the word Vyushta in the sense of new year’s day, see my paper on VyTishta in the vol. of 2nd Oriental Conference, Calcutta, 1922. * The word may mean “Sending out spies.” 60 KAUTILYA'S ARTHASASTRA the collection and audit of all kinds of revenue—these constitute the work in hand. That which ha3 been credited to the treasury; that which has been taken by the king ; that which has been spent in connection with the capital city not entered (into the register) or continued from year before last, the royal command dictated or orally intimated to be entered (into the register)—all these constitute the w'ork accomplished. Preparation of plans for profitable works, balance of fines due, demand for arrears of revenue kept in abeyance, and examination of accounts—these constitute what is called part of a work in hand which may be of little or no value.1 Receipts may be (l) current, (2) last balance, and (3) accidental (anyajatah = received from external source). What is received day after day is termed current (vartamana). Whatever has been brought forward from year before last, whatever is in the hands of others, and whatever has changed hands is termed last balance (parvushita). Whatever has been lost and forgotten (by others), fines levied from government servants, marginal revenue (plrsva), compensation levied for any damage (p.trihli?ikam), presentations to the king, the property of those who have fallen victims to epidemics (damaraga- takasvam) leaving no sons, and treasure troves—all these constitute accidental receipts. Investment of capital (vikshCpa), the relics of a wrecked under¬ taking, and the savings from an estimated outlay are the means to check expenditure (vyayapratyayah). The rise in price of merchandise due to the use of different weights1 and measures in selling is termed vyaji ; the enhancement of price due to .bidding among buyers is also another source of profit. Expenditure is of two kinds—daily expenditure and profitable expenditure. gg What is continued every day is daily. Whatever is earned once in a paksha, a month, ora year is termed profit. 1 See next chapter. * Attending to the difference between royal and market weights and measure*; see Chap. XII, Book II. 61 KAUT ILYA’S ARTHASASTRA Whatever is spent on these two heads is termed as daily expenditure and profitable expenditure respectively. That which remains after deducting all the expenditure already incurred and excluding all revenue to be realised is net balance (nlvi) which may have been either just realised or brought forward.

Hence foremost attention shall be paid to the treasury* Public prosperity (pracharasamrddhih), rewards for good conduct (charitriinugrahah)* capture of thieves, dispensing with (the service of too many) government servants, abundance of harvest, prosperity of commerce, absence of troubles and calamities (upasargapra- mokshah), diminution of remission of taxes, and income in gold (hira 11 y 0 payanam) are all conducive to financial prosperity* Obstruction (pratibandha), loan (prayoga), trading (vyavahara), fabrication of accounts (avastara), causing the loss of revenue (pari- hapaim), self-enjoyment (upabhoga), barter (parivartana), and defal¬ cation (apahara) are the causes that tend to deplete (the treasury)* Failure to start an undertaking or to realise its results, or to „ credit its profits (to the treasury) is known as obstruction. ^ Herein a fine of ten times the amount in question shall be imposed. Lending the money of the treasury on periodical interest is a loan. Carrying on trade by making use of government money is trading.

Herein death sentence shall be passed for enjoying gems, middlemost amercement for enjoying valuable articles, and restoration of the articles together with a fine equal to their value shall be the punishment for enjoying articles of inferior value. The act of exchanging government articles for (similar) articles of others is barter. This offence is explained by self-enjoyment. Whoever does not take into the treasury the fixed amount of revenue collected, or does not spend what is ordered to be spent,1 or misrepresents5 the net revenue collected, is guilty of defalcation of government money. Herein a fine of twelve times the amount shall be imposed. There are about forty ways of embezzlement r what is realised earlier is entered later on ;3 what is realised later is entered earlier ;4 what ought to be realised is not realised ; what is hard to realise is shown as realised \J what is collected is shown as not collected : what has not been collected is shown as collected ; what is collected in part is entered as collected in full; what is collected in full is entered as collected in part; what is collected is of one sort,1* while what is entered is of another sort; what is realised from one source is shown as realised from another ; what is payable is not paid : what is not payable is paid ; not paid in time ;* paid untimely ;* small gifts made large gifts ; large gifts made small gifts ; what is gifted is of one sort while what is entered is of another ; the ° real donee is one while the person entered (in the register) as donee is another ; what has been taken into (the treasury) is removed while what has not been credited to it is shown as credited : raw materials that are not paid for are entered, while those that are paid for are not entered ; an aggregate* is scattered in pieces ; scattered items10 are converted into an aggregate ; commodities of greater value are bartered for those of small value ; what is of smaller value is 1 Snch as gift made by the king. 1 Vipratijanlte. denies the receipt. s Such as rice, etc. 4 Such as the late crops, wheat, etc. 5 Taxes from Brahmans. • Such as pulses in place of rice, etc. T Not giving gifts on the occasion of marriages as ordered by tho king. 8 Giving gift later with a view to force the receiver to give bribes to the officer or clerk. • Such as representing an assessment of 1,000 panas levied from a whole village as small individual assessments, making up the total in view of making use of a part of the taxes for himself under the pretext of non-payment of that part.—Com. 10 Making ryotwar assessments as village-assessments. 67 KAUTILYA’S ARTHASASTRA bartered for one of greater value; price of commodities enhanced ; price of commodities lowered ; number of nights increased ;* number of nights decreased ; the year not in harmony with its months ; the month not in harmony with its days ; inconsistency in the transac¬ tions’ carried on with personal supervision (samagamavishamah); misrepresentation of the source of income ; inconsistency in giving charities ; incongruity3 in representing the work turned out ; in¬ consistency in dealing with fixed items ; misrepresentation of test marks or the standard of fineness (of gold and silver); mis¬ representation of prices of commodities; making use of false weights and measures ; deception in counting articles ; and making use of false cubic measures such as bhajana—these are the several ways of embezzlement. Under the above circumstances, the persons concerned, such as the treasurer (nidhayaka), the prescriber (nibandhaka), the receiver (pratigrahaka), the payer (dayaka), the person who caused the pay¬ ment (dapaka), the ministerial servants to the officer (mantri- vaiyavrtyakara) shall each be separately examined. If any one of these tells a lie, he shall receive the same punishment as the chief officer (yuktal who committed the offence. A proclamation in public (prachara) shall be made to the effect “ whoever has suffered at the hands of this offender may make their grievances known to the king.” Those who respond to the call shall receive such compensation as is equal to the loss they have sustained. When there are a number of offences in which a single officer is involved, and when his being guilty of parOkta4 in any one of those charges has been established, he shall be answerable for all those offences.5 Otherwise (i.e. when it is not established), he shall be tried for each of the charges. 1 With a view to misappropriate the wages due for the increased or decreased days. The word “ratri” = night, is used both for day and night.—Com. 2 Stating that a labourer has been paid outside the office, while in reality no such payment has been made. 5 As in the case of the superintendent of boats misappropriating ferry dues under the false plea that only Brahmans crossed the river on a particular day.—Com. 4 Failure to prove one’s own position, either as a eomplainant or defend¬ ant.

If an informant succeeds in proving only a part of a big embezzlement, he shall, nevertheless, get the prescribed share of the part of the embezzled amount proved. An informant who fails to prove (his assertion) shall be liable to monetary or corporal punishment, and shall never be acquitted. When the charge is proved, the informant may impute the tale bearing to someone else or clear himself in any other way from the blame.

Raw flour and kulmasha (boiled and forced rice) will be as much as one and a half of the original quantity of the grains. Barley gruel as well as its flour baked will be twice the original quantity. Kodrava (Paspalam Scrobiculatum), varaka (Phraseolus Trilobus), udaraka (Panicum), and priyangu (millet) will increase three times the original quantity when cooked. \ rihi (rice) will increase four times when cooked.

KAUTILYA'S ARTHASASTRA 143 (4) When under the fear of cattle-lifting enemies (parachakrafca- 129 vibhayat), cattle are kept under the care of the superintendent, giving him one-tenth of the dairy produce for his protection, it is termed “ herds maintained for a share in dairy produce.” (5) When the superintendent classifies cattle as calves, steers, tameable ones, draught oxen, bulls that are to be trained to yoke, bulls kept for crossing cows, cattle that are fit only for the supply of flesh, buffaloes and draught buffaloes; female calves, female steer, heifer, pregnant cows, milch cattle, barren cattle—either cows or buffaloes ; calves that are a month or two old as well as those which are still younger ; and when, as he ought to, he brands them all, inclusive of their calves of one or two months old along with those stray cattle which have remained unclaimed in the herds for a month or tw’o ; and when he registers the branded marks, natural marks, colour and the distance from one horn to another of each of the cattle, that system is known as “ class of herds.” (6) When an animal is carried off by thieves or finds itself into the herds of others or strays unknown, it is called “ lost.” (7) When an animal is entangled in a quagmire or precipice or dies of disease or of old age, or drowned in water; or w hen it is killed by the fall of a tree or of river bank, or is beaten to death with a staff or stone, or is struck by lightning (isana), or is devoured by a tiger or bitten by a cobra, or is carried off by a crocodile, or is involved in the midst of a forest fire, it is termed as ” irrecoverably lost. ” Cowherds shall endeavour to keep them away from such dangers. Whoever hurts or causes another to hurt, or steals or causes auother to steal, a cow, should be slain. When a person substitutes an animal (riipa) bearing the royal brand mark for a private one, he shall be punished with the first amercement. When a person recovers a local cattle from thieves, he shall receive the promised reward (panitam rupam); and when a man rescues a foreign cattle (from thieves), he shall receive half its value. Cow herds shall apply remedies to calves or aged cows or cows suffering from diseases. Thev shall graze the herds in forests which are severally allotted _ as pasture grounds for various seasons and from which thieves, tigers and other molesting beasts are driven away by hunters aided b.v their houuds. 144 KAUTILYA’S ARTHAS\STUA With a view to scare out snakes and tigers and as a definite means of knowing the whereabouts of herds, sounding bells *shall be attached to (the neck of) timid cattle. Cowherds shall allow their cattle to enter into such rivers or hikes as are of equal depth all round, broad, and free from mirt and crocodiles, and shall protect them from dangers under such circumstances. Whenever an animal is caught hold of by a thief, a tiger, a snake, or a crocodile, or when it is too infirm owing to age or disease, they shall make a report of it; otherwise they shall be compelled to make good the loss. When an animal dies a natural death, they shall surrender the skin with the brand mark, if it is a cow or a buffalo ; the skin together with the ear (karnalakshapam), if it is a goat or sheep ; the tail with the skin containing the brand mark, if it is an ass or a camel; the skin, if it is a young one ; besides the above (they shall also restore) the fat (vasti), bile, sinew (snayu), teeth, hoofs, horns, and bones. They (the cowherds) may sell either flesh or dried flesh. They shall give buttermilk as drink to dogs and hogs, and reserve a little (buttermilk) in a bronze vessel to prepare their own dish : they mav also make use of coagulated milk or cheese (kilafca) to render their oil-cakes relishing (ghanapinyakakledartha). He who sells his cow (from among the henls) shall pay (to the king) one-fourth rupa (value of the cow). During the rainy, autumual, and the first part of winter (heinanta) seasous, they shall milk the cattle both the times (morning and evening) ; and during the latter part of winter and the whole of the spring and summer seasons, they shall milk only once (i.e. only in morning). The cowherd who milks a cow a second time during these seasons shall have his thumb cut off. If he allows the time of milking to lapse, he shall forfeit the profit thereof ti.e. the milk). The same rule shall hold good in case of negligence of the opportune moment for putting a string through the nose of a bull and other animals, and for taming or training them to the yoke. One drOna of a cow s milk will, when churned, yield one prastha ^ of butter; the same quantity of a buffalo s milk will yield one-seventh prastha more ; and the same quantity of milk of goats and sheep will produce one-half prastha more. 145 KAUTILYA’S ARTHAS.ASTRA In all kinds of milk, the exact quantity of butter shall be ascertained by churning ; for increase in the supply of milk and butter depends on the nature of the soil and the quantity and quality of fodder and water. When a person causes a bull attached to a herd to fight with another bull, he shall be punished with the first amercement; when a bull is injured (under such circumstances), he shall be punished with the highest amercement. Cattle shall be grouped in herds of ten each of similar colour while they are being grazed. According to the protective strength of the cowherds and the capacity of the cattle to go far and wide to graze, cowherds shall take their cattle either far or near. Once in six months, sheep and other animals shall be shorn of their wool. The same rules shall apply to herds of horses, asses, camels, and hogs. For bulls which are provided with nose-strings, and which equal horses in speed and in carrying loads, half a bhar.i1 of meadow grass (yavasa), twice the above quantity of ordinary grass (trna), one tula (100 palas) of oil cakes, 10 adhakas of bran, 5 palas of salt (mukha- lavanam), one kudumbn of oil for rubbing over the nose (nasya), 1 prastha of drink (pana), one tula of flesh, 1 adhaka of curds, 1 drOpa of barley or of cooked mash a (Phraseolus Radiatus), 1 drOna of milk ; or half an adhaka of sura (liquor), 1 prastha of oil or ghee Isneha), 10 palas of sugar or jaggery, 1 pala of the fruit of srngibera (ginger) may be substituted for milk (pratipaua). The same commodities less by one quarter each will form the diet for mules, cows, and asses; twice the quantity of the above things for buffaloes and camels. Draught oxen and cows, supplying milk (payah), shall be provided with subsistence in proportion to the duration of time the oxen are kept at work, and the quantity of milk which the cows supply. All cattle shall be supplied with abundance of fodder and water. * . Thus the manner of rearing herds of cattle has been dealt with. A herd of 100 heads of asses and 'mules shall contain 5 male » 2,000 palas.—Com. 10 146 KAUTILYA’S ARTHASASTRA animals ; that of goats and sheep ten ; and a herd of ten heads of either cows or buffaloes shall contain four male animals.1 [Thus ends Chapter XXIX, “ The Superintendent of Cows/* in Book II, “The Duties of Government Superintendents” of the Arthasastra of Kautilva.

He shall make a report (to the king) of such animals as are inauspicious, crippled, or diseased. Every horseman shall know how to make an economic use of whatever he has received from the king’s treasury and storehouse. The superintendent shall have a stable constructed as spacious as required by the number of horses to be kept therein, twice as broad as the length of a horse, with four doors facing the four quarters, with its central floor suited for the rolling of horses, with projected front provided with wooden seats at the entrance, and containing monkeys, peacocks, red spotted deer (prshata), mun- goose, partridges (chakora), parrots, and maina birds (sarika); the room for every horse shall be four times as broad or long as the length of a horse, with its central floor paved with smoothened wooden planks, with separate compartments for fodder (khadana- koshthakam), with passages for the removal of urine and dung, and wjth a door facing either the north or the east. The distinction of quarters (digvibhaga) may be made as a matter of fact or relatively to the situation of the building. Steeds, stallions and colts shall be separately kept. 1 In gloka-metre. 147 KAUTILYA’S ARTHASlSTKA A steed that has just given birth to a colt shall be provided for the first three days with a drink of one prastha of clarified butter ; afterwards it shall be fed with a prastha of flour (saktu) and made to drink oil mixed with medicine for ten nights ; after that time, it shall have cooked grains, meadow grass, and other things suited to the season of the day. A colt, ten days old, shall be given a kuflumba of flour mixed with one-fourth kudutnba of clarified butter, and .one prastha of milk till it becomes six months old ; then the above rations shall be increased half as much during each succeeding month, with the addition of one prastha of barley till it becomes three years old, then one drOiia of barley till it grows four years old ; at the age of four or five it attains its full development and becomes serviceable. The face (mukha) of the best horse measures 32 angulas; its length is 5 times its face ; its shank is 20 angulas ; and its height is 4 times its shank. Horses of medium and lower sizes fall short of the 133 above measurement by two and three angulas respectively. The circumference (parinaha) of the best horse measures 14)0 angulas, and horses of medium and lower sizes fall short of the above measurement by five parts (panchabhagavaraiu). For the best horse (the diet shall be) two drOnas of any one of the grains, rice (iali, vrihi), barley, panic seeds (privangu) soaked or cooked, cooked mudga (Phrascolus Mungo), or masha (Phraseolus Radiatus) ; one prastha of oil, 5 palas of salt, 50 palas of flesh, one adhaka of broth (rasa), or two fujhakas of curd, five palas of sugar (kshftra), to make their diet relishing, one prastha of suri (liquor), or two prasthaa of milk. The same quantity of drink shall be specially given to those horses which are tired of long journey or of carrying loads. One prastha of oil for giving enema (anuvasana), one kudumba of oil for rubbing over the nose, 1,000 palas of meadow grass, twice as much of ordinary grass (trpa); and hay stalk or grass shall be spread over an area of 6 aratnis.* The same quantity of rations less by one-quarter for horses of medium and lower size.

KAUTILYA’S ARTHASASTRA 151 136 CHAPTER XXXI Tub Superintendent of Elephants The superintendent of elephants shall take proper steps to protect elephant forests and supervise the operations with regard to the standing or lying in stables of elephants, male, female, or young, when they are tired after training, and examine the proportional quantity of rations and grass, the extent of training given to them, their accoutrements and ornaments, as well as the work of elephant doctors, of trainers of elephants in warlike feats, and of grooms, such as drivers, binders, and others. There shall be constructed an elephant stable twice as broad and twice as high as the length (ayama) of an elephant, with separate apartments for female elephants, with projected en¬ trance (sapragrlvam),1 with posts called kumari,1 * and with its door facing either the cast or the north. The space in front of the smooth posts (to which elephants are tied) shall form a square, one side of which is equahto the length of an elephant, aud shall be paved with smooth wooden planks and provided with holes for the removal of urine and dung. The space where an elephant lies down shall be as broad as the length of an elephant, and provided with a platform raised to half the height of an elephant for leaning on. Elephants serviceable in war or for riding shall be kept inside the fort; and those that are still being tamed or are of bad temper shall be kept outside. The first and the seventh of the eight divisions of the day are the two bathing times of elephants; the time subsequent to those two periods is for their food; forenoon is the time for their exercise ; afternoon is the time for drink ; two (out of eight) parts of the night are the time for sleep ; one-third of the night is spent in taking wakeful rest. The summer is the season to capture elephants. That which is 20 years old shall be captured.

If she gets out against the order lof her husband) to the contrary, she shall be fined 12 pa^as. If she goes beyond her neighbouring house Jprativesagrha- tigatiyah), she shall be fined 6 panas. If she allows into her house her neighbour, takes into her house the aims of any mendicant, or the merchandise of any merchant, she shall be fined 12 panas. If she deals as above though expressly forbidden, she shall be punished with the first amercement. If she goes out beyond the surrounding houses (parigrhatigatayam), she shall be fined 24 panas. If, under any other excuse than danger, she takes into her house the wife of another man, she shall be fined 100 papas. But she will not be guilty if the entrance is effected without her knowledge or against her orders to the contrary. My teacher says: With a view to avoid danger, it is no offence for women to go to any male person who is a kinsman of her husband, or is a rich and prosperous gentleman * sukhavastha), or is the headman of the village, or is one of her guardians (anv<idhikula), or who belongs to the family of a mendicant woman, or to any one of her own kinsmen. But Kautilya questions: How is it possible for good women (sadhvijana) to know at least this fact, that the family 1 Katyayana. * KAUTILYA’8 arthasaSTra 179 of her own kinsmen consisting of a number of males is good 1 It is no offence for women to go to the houses of kinsmen under the circumstances of death, disease, calamities, and confinement of _Q women. Whoever prevents her going under such circum- 1 ° stances, shall be fined 12 papas. If a woman conceals herself under such cricumstatices, she shall forfeit her endowment. If her kinsmen conceal her (with a view to exempt her from giving her aid under such circumstances) they shall lose the balance of bulka money due to them from her husband for giving her in marriage. Thus vagrancy is dealt witli. (Elopement or Criminal Rendezvous) If, leaving her husband's house, a woman goes to another village, she shall not only pay a fine of 12 papas, but also forfeit her endow¬ ment and jewels (sthapyabharapalopascha). If under any other excuse than receiving her subsistence or pilgrimage1 (dharmadanatirtha- gamanabhyamanyatra), a woman goes to any other place, even in company with an associable man, she shall not only pay a fine of 24 papas, but also lose all kinds of social privileges (sarvadharmalo- pascha)/ But the man who allows such a woman to accompany him in his journey shall be punished with the first amercement. If both of them (man and woman) have similar ideals in life (tulyasreyasoh) and are of sinful life (papiyaaoh), each of them shall be punished with the middlemost amercement. If he whom a woman accompanies in her journey is her near relative, he shall not be punished. If a relative allows a woman to accompany him, though he is forbidden, he shall be punished with half the above fine (middlemost amerce¬ ment). If on a road, or in the middle of a forest, or in any other concealed places a woman falls into the compauy of any other man, or if, with a view to enjoyment, she accompanies a suspicious or forbidden man, she shall be guilty of elopement (saigrahanara vidyat). It is no offence for women to fall into the company of actors, players, singers, fishermen, hunters, herdsmen, vintners, or persons of any other kind who usually travel with their women. If a man takes a woman with him on his journey* though forbidden to do so, or if a woman accompanies a man though she is forbidden to do so, halt of the above fines shall be meted out to them. Thus elopement is dealt with. 1 Tirthagamana: intercourse with the husband after menses.—T.M. Com. * Pariisara, 10, 28-30. 180 KAUTILYA’S ARTH AS AST It A (Re-marriage of Women) Wives who belong to tffidra, Vaisya, Kshatriyn or Brahman caste, and who have not given birth to children, should wait as long as a year, two, three, and four years respectively for their husbands who have gone abroad for a short time ; but iif they are such as have given birth to children, they should wait for their absent husbands for more than a year. If they are provided with maintenance, they should wait for twice the period of time just mentioned. If they are not so provided with, their well-to-do gnat.is should maintain them either for four or eight years. Then the g'mtis should leave them to marry, after taking what had been presented to them on the occasion of their marriages. If the ' 159 ^us^an^ ’s a Brahman, studying abroad, his wife who has no issue should wait for him for ten years; but if she has given birth to children, she should wait for twelve years. If the husband is a servant of the king, his wife should wait for him till her death ; but even if she bears children to a snvarna husband (i.e. a second husband belonging to the same gotrn as that of the former husband), with a view to avoid the extinction of her race, she shall not be iiable to contempt thereof (savarnatascha r.rajatft na’pavadam labheta). If the wife of an absent husband lacks maintenance and is deserted by well-to-do g'mtis, she may re-marry one whom she likes and who is in a position to maintain her and relieve her misery, A young ™ ife (kumari) who is wedded in accordance with the custom of the first four kinds of marriage (dharmavivahat), and whose husband has gone abroad and is heard of shall wait for him for the period of seven menses (saptatirthinyakinksheta), provided he has not announced his departure; but she shall wait for him a year in case of his having announced the same. In the case of a husband who is gone abroad but who is not heard of, his wife shall wait for the |>criod of five menses, but if the absent husband is not heard of, his wife shall wait for him for the period of ten menses. In the case of a husband who is gone abroad and is not heard of, his wife shall, if she has received only a part of sulka from him. wait for him for the period of three menses; but if he is heard of. she shall wait for him for the period of seven menses. A young wife who has received the whole amount of ralka shall wait for the period of five menses for her absent husband who is not heard of; but if he is heard of, she shall wait for him for the period KAUT ILYA’S ARTHASASTRA 181 of ten menses. Then with the permission of judges (dharmas- thairvisrshta), she may marry one whom * she likes; for neglect of intercourse with wife after her monthly ablutiop is, in the opinion of Kautilya, a violation of one’s duty (tirthoparodhohi dharmavadha iti Kan til yah). In the case of husbands who have long gone abroad (dTrghapravasinah), who have become ascetics, or who have been dead, their wives, having no issue, shall wait for them for the period of seven incuses ; but if they have given birth to children, they shall wait for a year. Then (each of these women) may marry the brother of her husband. If there are a number of brothers to her lost husband, she shall marry such a one of them as is next in age to her former husband, or as is virtuous and is capable of protecting her, or one who is the youngest and un¬ married. If there are no brothers to her lost husband, she may marry one who belongs to the same gotra as her husband’s or a relative, t,a of the same family* But if there are many such perrons as can be selected in marriage, she shall choose one who is a nearer relation of her lost husband.1 *If a woman violates the above rule by re-marrying one who is not a kinsman (dayada) of her husband, then the woman and the man who re-marry each other, those that have given her in re-marriage and those who have given their consent to it shall all be liable to the punishment for elopement.

But those w hose line or genealogy from the first ancestor is interrupted (vichchhinnapimj ih, i.e. those yrho are subsequent to the fourth generation), shall have equal divisions/ Those who have been living together shall re-divide their property, whether they had already divided their ancestral property before or they had received no such property at all. Of sons, he who brings the ancestral property to a prosperous condition shall also have a share3 of the profit.4 If a man has no male issue, his own brothers, or persons who have been living with him (saha jivino va), shall take possession of his property (dravyam); and in their absence his daughters (born of marriages other than the first four), shall have.his property (riktham). If one -has sons, they shall have the property ; if one has (only) daughters born of such marriage as is contracted in accordance with the customs of any of the first four kinds of marriage, they shall have the property ; if there are neither sons nor such daughters, the dead man's father, if living, shall have it; if he, too, is not alive, the dead man’s father’s brothers and the sons of his brothers shall have it; if there are many brothers of his father, all of them shall divide it ; and each of the many sons of such brothers shall have one share due to his father (pituiekamamBam) ; if the brothers isodarya) are the sons of many fathers, they shall divide it, calculating from their fathers. Among a dead man’s father, brother, and brother’s sons, the succeeding ones shall depend on the preceding ones if living (for their shares); likewise the youngest on the eldest for his half share. A father, distributing his property while he is alive, shall make no distinction in dividing it among his sons.

In the absence of 'quadruped, the eldest shall take an additional share of one-tenth of the whole property excepting precious stones ; for by this act alone, he will be bound in his duty to his ancestors. The above method is in accordance with the rules observed among the followers of Usanas. The father being dead, his carriage and jewellery shall be the special share to the eldest; his bed, seat, and bronze plate in which he used to take his meals (bhuktnkamsyam), to the middlemost; and black grains, iron, domestic utensils, cows and cart to the youngest.

The same rule shall hold good with the middlemost and youngest sons; of these two, one who is endowed with 163 manliness (mhnushopetah), shall have half the special share usually given to the eldest. With regard to sons of many wives : Of sons of two wives of whom only one woman has gone through all the necessary religious ceremonials, or one of whom has married as a maiden, and the other not as a maiden, or one of whom has brought forth twins, it is by birth that primogen.tureship is decided.4 , In the case of sons such as Suta, Magudha, Wya, and Rathakara, inheritance will go to the capable ; and the rest will depend upon him for subsistence.* In the absence of the cap e. all will have equal shares.

The same fine (12 panas) shall be meted, out not only to a tenant who, though asked to evacuate, resides in the house, but also to the owner who forces out a renter who has paid his rent (from his house), unless the renter is involved in such acts as defamation, theft, robbery, abduction, or enjoyment with a false title. He who voluntarily evacuates a house shall pay the balance of the annual rent. If any one of a party does not take part in the construction of a building which is intended for the common use of all the members of that party, or if any one obstructs another member of a party in making use of any part of such a building, he shall be fined 12 panas. Similarly if any one mars another's enjoyment of such a building, he shall be fined double the above. ♦With the exception of private rooms and parlour (angaria) all other open parts of houses as well as apartments where fire is ever kindled for worship or a mortar is situated shall be thrown open for common use.1 [Thus ends Chapter VlIT, “ House-building, ” in the section of “ Buildings,99 in Book III, “ Concerning Law ” of the Arthasastra of Kautilya. End of the sixty-fifth chapter from the beginning.] CHAPTER IX Sale of Buildings, Boundary Disputes, Determination of Boundaries, and Miscellaneous Hindrances Kinsmen, neighbours, rich persons, shall in succession go for the purchase of land and other holdings. Neighbours of good family, 168 *n uum^er anc* different from the purchasers above mentioned, shall congregate in front of the building for sale and announce it as such. Accurate description of the exact boundaries of fields, gardens, buildings of any kind, lakes or tanks shall be declared before the eldore of the village or of the neighbourhood. If, on crying aloud thrice, ** Who will purchase this at such and such a price * ” no opposition is offered, the purchaser may proceed 1 The whole Chapter is full of obscure technical words. My translation is only tentative. The T.M. Com. is not clear. 191 KAUTJLYA’S ARTHA&ASTRA to purchase the holding in question. If at this time the value of the property is increased by bidding, even among persons of the same community, the increased amount together with the toll on the value shall be handed over into the king’s treasury. The bidder (vikrayapratikroshta) shall pay the toll. Bidding for a property in the abseuce of its owner shall be punished with a fine of 24 panas. If no real owner conies forward even on the expiration of seven nights, the bidder may take possession of the property. Sale of building, etc. (vastu), to other than the bidder shall be punished with a fine of 200 panas ; if the property is other than buildings, etc. (vastu), the fine for the above offence shall be 24 panas. Thus the sale of buildings is dealt with. (Boundary Disputes) In all disputes regarding the boundary between anv two villages, neighbours or elders of five or ten villages (pa lcbagniml dasagrmri va) shall investigate the case on the evidence to be furnished from natural or artificial boundary marks.1 Elders among1 cultivators and herdsmen, or outsiders who have had the experience of former possession in the place, or one or many persons (not) personally acquainted w*ith the boundary marks under dispute shall first describe the boundary marks, and then, wearing unusual dress (viparltaveshah), shall lead the people (to the place).1 If the boundary marks just described arc not found, a fine of 1,000 pages shall be imposed (on the misleading or guilty person). If, however, they arrive at the exact spot, the party who- have either encroached upon the boundary or have destroyed the boundary marks shall be similarly punished/ The king shall beneficially distribute among others those holdings which have no boundarv marks or which have ceased to be 169 enjoyed by any person.4 {Disputes about Fields) Disputes concerning fields shall be decided by the elders of the neighbourhood or of the village.' If they are divided in their opinions, decision shall be sought for from a number of pure and respectable people, or, the disputants may equally divide the disputed holding among themselves. If both of these methods fail, i M. 8. 245. • Y. 2, 150. 151 ; X. 11, 10. * Y. 2, 153, 155. * 3!. 8, 265. * M. 8, 258. 192 KAUTILYA’S ARTH As ASTRA the holding (vastu} under dispute shall be taken possession of by the king.^ The same rule shall hold good in the case of a holding for which no claimant is forthcoming ; or it may beneficially be distri¬ buted among the people. Occupation of a holding (vastu) by force shall be punished as theft. If a holding is taken possession of by another on some reasonable grounds, lie shall be made to pay to the owner some rent, the amount of which is to be fixed after mature considerations of what is necessary for the subsistence of the cultivator of tbe bolding by him. Encroachment upon boundaries shall be punished with the first amercement. Destruction of boundaries shall be punished with a fine of 24 panas.1 The same rules shall hold good in disputes concerning hermitage iu forests, pasture lands, high roads, crema¬ tion-grounds, temples, sacrificial places, and places of pilgrimage. Thus the determination of boundaries is dealt with. (M%scrlfo neous Fli ndranees) All kinds of disputes shall depend for their settlement on the evidence to be furnished by neighbours.* Of pasture lands, plains, fields (kedara), flower gardens, a threshing-floor (khala), houses, and stables of horses (vahanakoshtha), hindrance to any one coming late in order shall be removed in preference to the one or more coming later in the series. With the exception of forests of Brahmans and of Soma plants, temples, and places of gods, and sacrifice and pilgrimage, all other places are plains. Any person causing, while making use of tanks, rivers, or fields, damage to the seeds sown in the fields of others, shall pay as much compensation to the sufferers as is equivalent to the damage. If the owner of any one of the following, viz. wet fields, gardens, or any kind of buildings, causes damage to those owned by others, the fine shall be double the value of the damage. The water of a lower tank shall not submerge the field irrigated by a higher tank. Tbe natural overflow of water from a higher to a lower tank shall not be stopped unless the lower tank has ceased to be useful for three consecutive years. Violation of this rule shall be punished with the first amercement. The same punishment shall be meted * Y. 2, 155. *N. II, 12. »X. 11.2.

Buildings of any kind Isctubandhal, neglected for five consecutive years, shall be forfeited, except in calamities.1 170 (Remissioyi of Taxes) In the case of construction of new works, such as tanks, lakes, etc., taxes (on the lands below such tanks) shall be remitted for five years (panchavarshikah pariharah). For repairing neglected or ruined works of similar nature, taxes shall be remitted for four years. For improving or extending or restoring water-works over-grown with weeds, taxes shall be remitted for three years. In the case of acquiring such newly started works by mortgage or purchase, taxes on the lands below such works shall be remitted for two years. If uncultivated tracts are acquired (for cultivation) by mortgage, purchase or in any other way, remission of taxes shall be for two vears. Out of crops grown by irrigation by means of wind power or bullocks (vatapravartimanandinibandhayatana)’ or below tanks, in fields, parks, flower gardens, or in any other way, so much of tho produce as would not entail hardship on the cultivators may be given to the government. Persons who cultivate the lands below tanks, etc., of others at a stipulated price (prakraya), or for annual rent (avakraya), or for certain number of shares of the crops grow n (bhiiga), or persons who are permitted to enjoy such lands free of rent of any kind, shall keep the tanks, etc., in good repair; other¬ wise they shall be punished with a fine of double the loss. ♦Persons, letting out the water of tanks, etc., at any other place than their sluice gate (apare), shall pay a fine of fi panas; and persons who Tecklessly obstruct the flow of water from the sluice gate of tanks shall also pay the same fine.’ [Thus ends Chapter IX, “ Sale of Buildings, Boundary Disputes, Determination of Boundaries, and Miscellaneous Hindrances,” in the section of 44 Buildings, ” in Book III, “ Concerning Law ” of the Arthasastra of Kautilya. End of the sixty-sixth chapter from the beginning.] ■ X. 11,26. * The Munich Manuscript rearls. “Xadi nibandhiyatana,” damming a river. * The T. M.

Construction in the sites belonging to others, of any buildings with a view to attract pilgrims thereto, of abodes of worship (chaitya), or of temples of gods; as also the sale or mortgage, or causing the sale or mortgage, of any long-continued _ charitable building (purvanuvrttam dharmasetuin) shall be punished with the middlemost amercement. Those wTho are witnesses to such transactions shall be punished with the highest amercement, excepting in the case of neglected or ruined buildings. In the absence of claimants to dilapidated religious buildings, villagers (gramuh), or charitable people (punyasllava) may repair them. (Blocking the Roads) Forms of roads and paths have been dealt with in connection with the construction of forts (First Chapter, Book II). Obstruction to roads for inferior beasts or men shall be punished with a fine of 12 papas; to roads for superior beasts, 24 panas ; to roads for elephants or to those leading to fields, 54 panas ; to those leading to any buildings or forests (setuvanapatham), 600 panas to those for burial grounds or villages, 200 papas; to those for drOnamukha, a fortress, 500 papas ; and those leading to sthanlya, country parts, or pasture grounds, 1.000 papas.’ The same tines shall be meted out in case of ploughing the several roads too deep (atikarshape chaishftm) ; and one-fourth of the same fines for ploughing merely on their surface. If a cultivator ora neighbour makes encroachment upon a field during the time of sowing seeds, he shall be fined 12 papas, unless the encroachment is due to evils, calamities or intolerable occurrences arising otherwise from the field (anyatra doshopanipatavishahye- bhyah). (Settling in Villages) Tax payers shall sell or mortgage their fields to :tax payers 1 600, shatchhata, seems to be a clerical error, as it falls between 54 and -<H> and is inconsistent with the apparent progressive scale. * X. it, 15. 1 195 KAUTILYA’S AUTHASASTRA alone ; Brahmans shall sell or mortgage their Brahmadeya or gifted lands only to those who are endowed with such lands; otherwise they shall be punished with the first amercement. The same punishment shall be meted out to a tax payer who settles in a village not inhabited by tax payers. If a tax payer takes the place of another tax payer, he shall enjoy all the holdings but the house of the latter. Even the house may be given to the new settler- If a person cultivates an inalienable land of another person who does not cultivate it, such a person shall restore the same after five years enjoyment on taking a certain amount of compensation equivalent to the improvement he made on the lands. Persons who are not tax payers and who sojourn abroad shall retain the right of ownership (bhogam) of their lands. (The Headman of the Village) When the headman of a village has to travel on account of any business of the whole village, the villagers shall by turns accompany him. Those who cannot do this shall pay li papas for every yojana.' If the headman of a village sends out of the village any person except a thief, or an adulterer, he shall be punished with a fine of 24 panas, and the villagers with the first amercement (for doing the same). Rc-entrance into a village for a person previously sent out of it (nirastasya) is explained by ** settlement of persons in villages (treated of above). At a distance of 800 ahgulas around every village, an enclosure with timber po^s shall be constructed.* (Trespassing Cattle) Pasture lands, plains aud forests may be availed of for grazing* cattle. For camels or buffaloes allowed to stray after grazing in pasture grounds, the fine shall be one-fourth of a pana ; for cows, horses, or asses, one-eighth of a pana ; for inferior quadrupeds, one* sixteenth of a pana ; and for cattle found lying thereon after grazing, tines shall be double the above ; for cattle ever found to live in the vicinity of pasture grounds, the fines shall he four times the above. *A yoianaso/j miles. * M. 8, 237. 198 KAUTILYA’S ARTHASASTRA (prakshepa) shall be one-half of the profit, and be regularly paid as each year expires. If it is allowed to accumulate owing either to the intention or to the absence abroad (of the receiver or payer), the amount payable shall be equal to twice the share or principal (mQlyadvigunah).1 A person claiming interest when it is not due, or representing as principal the total amount of his original principal and the interest thereon shall pay a fine of,four times the amount under dispute (bandhachaturgupah).* A creditor who sues for four times the amount, lent by him shall pay a fine of four times the unjust amount. Of this fine, the creditor shall pay three-quarters and the debtor one-quarter. Interest on debts due from persons who are engaged in sacrifices taking a long time (dlrghasatra), or who are suffering from disease, or who are detained in the houses of their teachers (for learning), or who are either minors or too poor, shall not accumulate. A creditor refusing to receive the payment of his debt shall pay a fine of 12 papas. If the refusal is due to some (reasonable) cause, then the amount free from interest (for subsequent time) shall be kept in the safe custody of others.* Debts neglected for ten years, except in the case of minors, aged persons, diseased persons, persons involved in calamities, or persons who are sojourn¬ ing abroad or have fled the country and except in the case of disturbances in the kingdom (rajyavibhrama), shall not be received back. Sons of a deceased debtor shall pay the principal with interest (kusidam). (In the absence of sons) kinsmen claiming the share of the dead man or sureties, such as joint partners of the debt (sah&gnihipah pratibhuvo va) shall pay the same.4 No other kind of surety is vaild (na pratibhavyamanvat); a minor, as surety, is in¬ efficient (balapratibhavyam asaram = surety of a minor is not strong). A debt, the payment of which is not limited by time or place or both (asamkhyata-desakalam), shall be paid by the sons, grandsons 175 °r 8n^ ot^er ^eirs of the dead debtor. Any debt, the pay¬ ment of which is not limited by time or place or both and for which life, marriage, or land is pledged, shall be borne by sons or grandsons.1 • » • _ y • 1 N. 1, 107; Vi. 6, 11-12. ■ * . * Compare “ Dasabandha ” and •• Paiichabandha ” below. * Y. 2, 44. ♦ Vi. 6, 27-29, 42. * M. $, 160.

Creditors guilty of parokta shall pay a fine of 10 times the amount (dasabandha) but if in¬ capable to pay so much, they shall at least pay five times the amount sued for (pa'chabandham ) ; thus the section on witnesses is dealt with. (Taking Oaths) Witness shall be taken* before Brahmans, vessels of water and fire. A Brahman witness shall be told, 11 Tell the truth ” ; a Kshatriya or a Vaisya witness shall be told thus : “ If thou utterest falsehood, thou do not attain the fruit of thy sacrificial and chari¬ table deeds; but having broken the array of thy enemies in war, thou do go a beggar with a skull in thy hand.” A Sodra witness thus : “ Whatever thy merits are, in thy former birth or after thy death, shall they go to the king and what¬ ever sins the king may have committed, shall they go to thee if thou utterest falsehood ; fines also shall be levied on thee, for facts as they have been beard or seen will certainly be subsequently revealed.”4 If in the course of seven nights, witnesses are found to have unanimously made a false concert among themselves, a fine of 12 panas shall be levied. If they are thus found in the course of three fortnights, they shall pay the amount sued for (abhiyogam dadyuh)/’ If witnesses differ, judgment may be given in accordance with the statements of a majority of pure and respectable witnesses;* or the mean of their statements may be followed ; or the amount * M. 8, 69, 72. * and * Since the Pahchabandha most be legs than Dasabandha. the inter* pretation of Pahchabandha a# Pahchamamaa, one fifth, by Vighaneavara in hi* commentary on verse 171, II, Yaghyaralkya, cannot be accepted.

If witnesses give testi¬ mony for a less amount, the plaintiff shall pay a fine proportional to the increased amount; if they attest to a greater amount, the excess shall go to the king. In cases where the plaintiff proves himself stupid, or where bad hearing (on the part of witness at the time of the transaction) or bad writing is the cause of difficulty, or where the debtor is dead, the evidence of witnesses alone shall be depended on Isakshipratyayameva syiit). “ Only,” say the followers of Usanas, “ in those cases where 177 witnesses prove themselves to have been stupid or seuseless and where the investigation of the place, time or nature of the transaction is of no avail, the three amercements shall be levied.” “ False witnesses,” say followers of Manu, “shall be fined ten times the amount which, no matter whether it is true or false, they cause to be lost.” “ If,” say the followers of Brhaspnti, 44 owing to their have been stupid, they render a case suspicious, they shall be tortured to death.” “ No,” says Kautilya, 44 it is the truth that witnesses have to hear (when they are called to attest to any transaction) ; if they have not minded it, they shall be fined 24 panas ; if they have attested to a false case (without scrutinising), they shall be fined half of the above tine.” 1 ♦Parties shall themselves produce witnesses who are not far removed either by time or place ; witnesses who are very far removed either by time or place ; witnesses who are very far, or who will not stir out, shall be made to present themselves by the order of the judges.’ [Thus ends Chapter XI, “Recovery of ]>ebts,” in Book III 4 ‘ Concerning Law ” of the Arthasastra of Kautilya.

The pledgee who enjoys the pledge without permission shall not 179 °D^ Det Pro^ derived fron* it, but also forfeit the debt.* The rules regarding deposits shall hold good in other matters connected with pledges. (Property Entrusted to Another for Delivery to a Third Person, The same rules shall apply to order (adesa), and property entrusted for delivery to a third person (anvadhi). If, through a merchant, a messenger is entrusted with a property for delivery to a third person (anvadhi hast ha) and such messenger does not reach the destined place, or is robbed of the property by thieves, the merchant shall not be responsible for it ;* nor shall a kinsman of the messenger who dies on.his way be responsible for the property. For the rest, the rules regarding deposits shall also hold good here. (BorrowedHired Properties) Properties either borrowed (vachitakam) or hired (avakrTtakam) shall be returned as intact as they were when received. If, owing to distance in time or place, or owing to some inherent defects of the properties or to some unforeseen accidents, properties either borrow¬ ed or hired are lost or destroyed, they need not be made good. The rules regarding deposits shall also apply here.4 (Retail Sale) Retail dealers, selling the merchandise of others at prices pre¬ vailing at particular localities and times shall hand over to the wholesale dealers as much of the sale proceeds and profit as is realised by them. The rules regarding pledges, shall also apply here. If, owing to distance in time or place, there occurs any fall in the value of the merchandise, the retail dealers shall pay the value 1 Y. 2, 63. * M. 8, 144. * N. 2. 314; Y. 2, 66. ♦ M. 2, 181.84. 204 KAUTILYA’S ART HAS ASTRA and profit at that rate which obtained when they received the merchandise. Servants selling commodities at prices prescribed by their masters shall realise no profit. They shall only return the actual Bale proceeds. If prices fall, they shall pay only as much of the sale proceeds as is realised at the low rate. But such merchants as belong to trade-guilds (samvyava- harikcahu) or are trustworthy and are not condemned by the king 180 nee(* D°* Testore even value of that merchandise which is lost or destroyed owing to its inherent defects or to some unforeseen accidents. But of such merchandise as is distanced by time or place, they shall restore as much value and profit as remains after making allowance for the wear and tear of the merchandise ; and also proportional part of every commodity. For the rest, the rules regarding deposits shall apply here. It explains retail sale. (Staled Deposits) The rules laid down concerning unsealed deposits tupanidhis) shall apply to sealed deposits also. A man handing over a sealed deposit to other than the real depositor shall be punished. In the case of a depository's denial of having received a deposit, the antecedent circumstances (pGrvapadanam) of ’the deposit and (the character and social position of) the depositor are the only evidences. Artisans (karavah) are naturally of impure character. It is not an approved custom with them to deposit for some reliable reason.1 When a depository denies having received a sealed deposit which was not, however, deposited for any reasonable cause,5 the depositor may obtain secret permission (from the judges) to produce such witnesses as he might have stationed under a wall (gudhabhitti) while depositing. In the midst of a forest or in the middle of a voyage an old or afflicted merchant might with confidence put in the custody of a depository some vatnnble article with certain secret mark, and go on his way. On his sending this information to his son or brother, the latter may ask for the sealed deposit. If the depository does not quietly return it, he shall not only forfeit his credit, but l>e liable to the punishment for theft besides being made to restore the deposit.* 1 Kiranapurva-anything of well.known origin.—Munich Manuscript. 3 Karanahina^anythingof unknown origin.—Munich Manuscript. * M. «, 205 KAUT ILYA’S ARTHASASTRA A reliable roan, bent on leaving this world and becoming an ascetic, may place a certain sealed deposit with some secret mark in the custody of a man, and, returning after a number of years, ask for it. If the depository dishonestly denies it, he shall not only be made to restore it, but be liable to the punishment for theft. A childish man with a sealed deposit with some secret mark may, while going through a street at night, feel frightened at his being captured by the police for untimely walking, and, placing the deposit in the custody of a man, go on his way. But subsequently put into jqj the jail, he may ask for it. If the depository dishonestly denies, he shall not only be made to restore it, but be liable to the punishment for theft. By recognising the sealed deposit in the custody of a man, any one of the depositor’s family may probably ask not only for the deposit, but also for information as to the whereabouts of the depo¬ sitor. If the custodian denies either, he shall be treated as before. In all these cases, it is of first importance to inquire how the property under dispute came in one’s possession, what are the circumstances connected with the various transactions concerning the property, and what is the status of the plaintiff in society as to wealth (arthasamarthyam). The above rules shall also apply to all kinds of transaction between any two persous Imifchassamavayahb ♦Hence before witnesses and with no secrecy whatever, shall all kinds of agreements be entered into; either with one’s own or different people, shall the circumstances of the time and place be minutely considered first. [Thus ends Chapter XII, “ Concerning Deposits,” in Book III, “ Concerning Law ” of the Arthasastra of Kautilya. End of the sixty-ninth chapter from the beginning ]. CHAPTER XIII Rules regarding Slaves and Labourers The selling or mortgaging by kinsmen of the life of a SUdra who is not a born slave, and has not attained majority, but is an Arya in birth shall be punished with a fine of 12 panas; of a Vaisya, 24 panas ; of a Kshatriya, 36 panas : and of a Brahman, 48 206 KAUTILYA’S ARTHASASTRA 182 panas. If persons other than kinsmen do the same, they shall be liable to the three amercements and capital punishment respectively: purchasers and abettors shall likewise be punished. It is no crime for Mlechchhas to sell or mortgage the life of their own offspring. But never shall an Arya be subjected to slavery.1 But if in order to tide over family troubles, to find money for fines or court decrees, or to recover the (confiscated) house¬ hold implements, the life of an Arya is mortgaged, they (his kinsmen) shall as soon as possible redeem him (from bondage) ? and more so if he is a youth or an adult capable of giving help. Any person who has once voluntarily enslaved himselfyshall, if he runs away (nishpatitah), be a slave for life.1 * Similarly any person whose life has been mortgaged by others shall, if he runs away twice, be a slave for life. Both of these two sorts of men shall, if they are once found desirous to run away to foreign countries, bef slaves for life. Deceiving a slave of his money or depriving him of the privileges he can exercise as an Arya (Aryabhava), shall be punished with half the fine (levied for enslaving the life of an Arya).1 A man who takes in mortgage a person who runs away, or who •lies or who is incapacitated by disease, shall be entitled to receive back (from the mortgager) the value he paid for the slave. Employing a slave to carry the dead or to sweep ordure, urine, or the leavings of food ; or a female slave to attend on her master while he is bathing naked ; or hurting or abusing him or her, or violating (the chastity of) a female slave shall cause the forfeiture of the value paid for him or her.4 Violation (of the chastity) of nurses, female cooks, or female servants of the class of joint cultivators' or of any other description shall at once earn their liberty for them. Violence towards an attendant of high birth shall entitle tim to run away. When a master has connection with a nurse or pledged female slave under his power agaiust her will, he shall be punished with the first amercement; for doing the same when she is under the power of another, he shall be punished with the middlemost amercement.* When a man commits or helps 1 Vi. 6, 151 ; X. 5, 39 ; M. 8, 412. * X. 5. 37. * A slave who robe his master of his money shall be punUhed with half the line.—T.M.

The offspring of a man who has sold himself off as a slave shall be an Arya. A slave shall he entitled to enjoy not only whatever he has earned without prejudice to his master s work, but also the inheritance he has received from his father. On paying the value (for which one is enslaved), a slave shall regain his Aryahood. The same rule shall apply either to born or pledged slaves. The ransom necessary for a slave to regain his freedom is equal to what he has been sold for. Any person who has been enslaved for fines or court decrees (dandaprapifcah) shall earn the amount by work.1 An Arya made captive in war shall for his freedom pay a certain amount proportional to the dangerous work done at the time of his capture, or half the amount/ If a slave who is less than eight years old and has no relatives, no matter whether he is born a slave in his master’s house, or fallen to his master s share of inheritance, or lias been purchased or obtain¬ ed by his master in any other wav, is employed in mean avocations against his will or is sold or mortgaged in a foreign land ;* or if a pregnant female slave is sold or pledged without any provision for her confinement, her master shall be punished with the first amerce¬ ment. The purchaser aud abettors shall likewise be punished. Failure to set a slave at liberty on the receipt of a required amount of ransom shall be punished with a fine of 12 papas: putting a slave under confinement for no reason Isararodhaschakaranat) shall likewise be punished. The property of a slave shall pass into the hands of his kinsmen ; in the absence of any kinsmen, his master shall take it. When a child is begotten on a female slave by her master, both the child and its mother shall at once be recognised as free.4 If, for the sake of subsistence, the mother has to remain in her bondage, her brother anil sister shall be liberated. tolling or mortgaging the life of a male or a female slave once liberated shall be punished with a tine of 12 papas, with the exception of those who enslave themselves.

Without taking permission from their employer, they shall neither leave out anything undone nor carry away anything with them from the place of work. They shall be fined 24 paisas for taking away anything and 12 panasfor leaving out anything undone.' Thus the rules regarding labourers. Guilds of workmen (sanghabhrtah, workmen employed by companies) as well as those who carry on any co-operative work (sambhdya samutthatharah) shall divide their earnings (vetanara = wages) either equally or as agreed upon among themselves. Cultivators or merchants shall, either at the end or in the middle of their cultivation or manufacture, pay to their labourers as much of the latter’s share as is proportional to the work done.* If the labourers, giving up work in the middle, supply substitutes, they shal l be paid their wages in full. But when commodities are being manufactured, wages shall be paid out according to the amount of work turned out; for such payment does not affect the favourble or unfavourable results on the way (i.c. in the sale of merchandise by pedlars). A healthy person who deserts his compAtay after work has been 186 ke&un shall be fined 12 pa^as;1 for none shall, of his own accord, leave his company. Any person who is found to have neglected his share of work by stealth shall be shown mercy (abhayam) for the first time, and given a proportional quantity of work anew with promise of proportional share of earnings as well. In case of negligence for a second time or of going elsewhere, he shall be thrown out of the company (pravasanam). If he is guilty of a glaring offence (mahaparadhe), he shall be treated as the eondemned.4 [Co-operation in Sacrificial Acts) Priests co-operating in a sacrifice shall divide their earnings either equally or as agreed upon, excepting what is especially due to each or any of them.

If in the sacrifice called Sutya, the same thing happens after the ceremony called Pratassavana, Jtlis of the share shall be paid ; after the ceremony called M&dhyandina, the present shall be paid in full; for by that time the payment of presents shall be over. In every sacrifice except the one called Brhaspatisavana, it is usual to pay presents. The same rule shall apply to the present payable in Aharganas, sacrifices so called. The surviving priests carrying the balance of the present or any other relatives of a dead priest shall perform the funeral ceremony of the dead form ten days and nights.* If the sacrificer himself (he who has instituted the sacrifice) dies, then the remaining priests shall complete the sacrifice and carry 187 awa-v I,resents- If a sacrificer sends out any priest before completing the sacrifice, he shall be punished with the first amercement. If a sacrificer sending out a priest happens to be a persou who has not kept the sacrificial fire, or to be a preceptor or one who has already performed sacrifices, then the fines shall be 100, 1,000 and 1,000 panas respectively. ♦As it is certain that sacrificial merits fall in value when per¬ formed in company with a drunkard, the husband of aSudra woman, a murderer of a Brahman, or one who has violated the chastity of the wife of his preceptor, a receiver of condemnable gifts, or is a thief, or one whose performance of sacrificial acts is condemnable, it is no offence to send out such a priest.* [Thus ends Chapter XIV, “ Rules regarding Labourers ; and Co-operative Undertaking,*' in the section of 41 Rules regarding Slaves and Labourers,” in Book III, 44 Concerning Law ” of the Arthasastra of Kautilya. End of the seventy-first chapter from the beginning.] 1 The text means " second share." * N. 3, 8. * X. 3, 9. 212 KAUT ILYA’S ARTHASASTRA CHAPTER XV Rescission of Purchase and Sale A merchant refusing to give his merchandise that he has sold shall be punished with a fine of 12 panas, unless the merchandise is naturally bad, or is dangerous, or is intolerable. That which has inherent defects is termed naturally bad ; what¬ ever is liable to be confiscated by the king, or is subject to destruc¬ tion by thieves, fire, or floods is termed as being dangerous; and whatever is devoid of all good qualities, or is manufactured by the diseased is called intolerable. Time for rescission of a sale is one night for merchants ; 3 nights for cultivators ; 5 nights for herdsmen ; and with regard to the sale or barter of precious things and articles of mixed qualities (vivtttivikraye)1 7 nights. Merchandise which is likely to perish sooner may, if there is no loss to others, be shown the favour of early disposal by prohibiting the sale elsewhere of similar merchandise which is not likely to perish so soon. Violation of this rule shall be punished with a fine of 24 panas or one-tenth of the merchandise sold against this rule. A person who attempts to return an article purchased by him shall, if the article other than what is naturally bad. or is dangerous, or is intolerable, be punished with a tine of 12 pa$as. The same rescission rules that apply to a seller shall apply to the purchaser also. (Marriage Contracts) [As regards marriages among the three higher castes, rejection of a bride before the rite of panigrahana, clasping of hands, is valid : but among the SQdras. before nuptials. Even in the case of a couple that has gone through the rite of pariigrahana,]1 rejection of % a bride whose guilt of having lain with another man has been afterwards detected is valid. But never so in the case of brides and bridegrooms of pure character and high family.4 Any person who has given a girl in marriage without announcing her guilt of having « N. 9. 5. * Vi. 6, 129. * The portion within the bracket* i» supplied from the Munich Manuscript. 4 For dissolution uf the choice of the bride and of marriage on the di^-overy of a blemish, see Narada, XII, 3 and 96. 213 KAUTILYA’S ARTHASASTRA lain with another shall not only be punished with a fine of 96 panas, but also be made to return the sulka and strTdhana.1 Any person receiving a girl in marriage without announcing the blemishes of the bridegroom shall not only pay double the above fine, but also forfeit the sulka and strldhana (he paid for the bride).1 (Sale of Bipeds, etc.) Sale of bipeds and quadrupeds as strong, healthy, and clean, though they are either unclean or actually suffering from leprosy and other diseases, shall be punished w’ith a fine of 12 panas. The time of rescission of sale is three fortnights for quadrupeds and one year for men ;4 for it is possible to know by that time their good or bad condition. ♦An assembly convened for the purpose shall, in the matter of rescinding, sales or gifts, decide in such a way that neither the giver nor the receiver shall be injured thereby. [Thus ends Chapter XV, “Rescission of Purchase and Sale,” in Book III, “ Concerning Law ” of the Arthasastra of Kautilya. End of the seventy-second chapter from the beginning.] CHAPTER XVI Resumption of Gifts, Sale without Ownership, and Ownership Rules concerning recovery of debts shall also apply to resump¬ tion of gifts.4 Invalid gifts shall be kept in the safe custody of some persons. Any person who has given as gift not only his 189 whole property, his sons, and his wife, but also his own life, shall bring the same for the consideration of rescissors.6 Gifts or charitable subscriptions to the wicked or for unworthy purposes, monetary help to such persons as are malevolent or cruel, and promise of sexual enjoyment to the unworthy shall be so settled by rescissors that neither the giver nor the receiver shall be injured thereby. * N. 12, 33. * A clear proof as to the prevalence in the fourth century B.C. of the custom of marrying women after puberty.

Co-operation in hurting a person, and showing a haughty attitude fcowrards the king, shall be punished with the highest amercement. No son, or heir claiming a dead man’s property shall, against his own will, pay the value of the bail borne by the dead man (pratibhavyadapda), the balance of any dowry (sulkasesha), or the stakes of gambling ; nor shall he fulfil the promise of gifts made by the dead man under the influence of liquor or love.1 Thus resump¬ tion of gifts is dealt with. [Sale without Ownership) As regards Sale without Ownership : On the detection of a lost property in the possession of another person, the owner shall cause the offender to be arrested through the judges of a court. If time or place does not permit this action, the owner himself shall catch hold of the offender and bring him before the judges. The judge shall put the question : how the offender came by the property. If he narrates bow he got it, but cannot produce the person w ho sold it to him, he shall be let off, and shall forfeit the property. But the seller, if unable to produce another seller who sold it to him, shall not only pay the value of the property, but also be liable to the punishment for theft.5 If a person with a stolen property in bis possession runs away or bides himself till the property is wholly consumed, he shall not only pay the value, but also be liable to the punishment for theft. After proving his claim to a lost property (svakaranamkftva), its owner shall be entitled to take possession of it. On his failure to 190 Prove his title to it, he shall be fined 5 times the value of the property (panchabandhadaudah)/* and the property shall be taken by the king. If the owner takes possession of a lost article without obtaining 1 M. 8. 159. * II. 8, 199 ; Y.%2, 169-70. 1 Vignan<4vara interpret* the word a* one-fifth of the value in Ydyna- talkya 1 y>irohar(vihy<\yi% 172. But this meaning is inconsistent with the contrast which Ch snaky a draws between dasabandha and panchabandhu in Chapter XI, where pahehabandha is less than dasabondha. See footnote. Chapters 1. XI, Book III. KAUTILYA’S ARTHASASTRA 215 permission from the court, he shall be punished with the first amercement. Stolen or lost articles shall, on being detected, be kept in the toll-gate. If no claimant is forthcoming within three fortnights, such articles shall be taken by the king. He who proves his title to a lost or stolen biped1 shall pay 5 panas towards ransom (before taking possession of it). Likewise the ransom for a single-hoofed animal shall be 4 parias ; for a cow or a buffalo, 2 parias; for minor quadrupeds, Jth of a pana; and for articles such as precious stones, superior or inferior raw materials, 5 per cent of their value.* Whatever of the property of his own subjects the king brings back from the forests and countries of enemies, shall be handed over to its owner. Whatever of the property of citizens robbed by thieves the king cannot recover, shall be made good from his own pocket.* If the king is unable to recover such things, he shall either allow any self-elected person (svayarngriha) to fetch them, or pay an equivalent ransom to the sufferer. An adventurer may enjoy whatever the king graciously gives him out of the booty he has plundered from an enemy’s country, excepting the life of an Arya and the property belonging to gods, Brahmans or ascetics. Thus sale without ownership is dealt with* (Ownership) As to the title of an owner to his property: The owners who have quitted their country where their property lies shall continue to have their title to it. When the owners other than minors, the aged, those that are afflicted with disease or calamities, those that are sojourning abroad, or thos^ that have deserted their country during national disturbances, neglect for ten years their property which is under the enjoyment of others, they shall forfeit their title to it. Buildings left for 20 years in the enjoyment of others shal1 not be reclaimed.4 But the mere occupation of the buildings of IQ. others during the absence of the king bv kinsmen, priests, or heretics shall not give them the right of possession. The same shall obtain with regard to open deposits, pledges, treasure ‘A male or female alave.—T.M. Cora. * Y. 2, 171-74 \Gaut. 10, 40-47; Vi.

A new comer shall, however, be provided with the space occupied by an old resident. If not willing to do so, the old occupier shall be sent out. The property of hermits^ (vanaprastha), ascetics (yati), or bachelors learning the Vedas (Brahmachari) shall on their death be taken by their preceptors, disciples, their brethren (dhartna- bhratr), or class-mates in succession.5 Whenever hermits, etc., have to pay any fines, they may, in the name of the king, perform penance, oblation to gods, fire-woTship, or the ritual called Mahakachchhavardhana for as many nights as the number of panas of their fines. Those heretics (pashac.dah) who have neither gold nor gold coin shall similarly observe their fasts, except in the case of defamation, theft, assault and abduction of women. Under these circumstances, they shall be compelled to undergo punishment. ♦The king shall, under penalty of fines, forbid the wilful or improper proceedings of ascetics : for vice, overwhelming righteous¬ ness, will in the long run destroy the ruler himself. [Thus ends Chapter XVI,Resumption of Gifts, Sale without Ownership, and Ownership ” in Book III, “ Concerning Law ” of the Arthas-stra of Kautilya. End of the seventy-third chapter from the beginning.] CHAPTER XVII Robbery Sudden and direct seizure (of person or property) is termed gahasa ; fraudulent or indirect seizure (niranvaye* pavyayanecha) is theft.* The school of Manu hold that the fine for the direct seizure of precious stones and superior or inferior raw' materials shall be equal to their value. It is equal to twice the value of the articles according to the followers of Usanas. 1 M. 8, 149. * Y. 2. 137. * M. 8, 332. KAUTILYA’S ARTHASASTRA 217 But Kautilya holds that it shall be proportional to the gravity of the crime. In the case of such articles of small value as flowers, fruits, vegetables, roots, turnips, cooked rice, skins, bamboo, and pots (earthenware) the fine shall range from 12 to 24 pa^as ; for articles of great value, such as iron (kalayasa), wood, roping materials, and herds of minor quadrupeds, and cloth, the fine shall range from 24 to 48 panas ; and for such articles of still greater value as copper, brass, bronze, glass, ivory and vessels, etc., it shall range from 48 to 96 panas. This fine is termed the first amercement. For the seizure of such as big quadrupeds, men, fields, houses, gold, gold coins, fine fabrics, etc., the fine shall range from 200 to 500 panas, which is termed the middlemost amercement.1 My preceptor holds that keeping, or causing to keep, by force either men or women in prison, or releasing them by force from imprisonment, shall be punished with fines ranging from 500 to 1,000 pa lias. This fine is termed the highest amercement.1 He who causes another to commit sahasa after the plans prepared by h&iself, shall be fined twice the value (of the person or property seized)- An abettor who employs a hireling to commit sahasa by promising, ** I shall pay thee as much gold as thou makest use of,” shall be fined four times the value.1 The school of Brhaspati are of opinion that if with the promise, ” I will pay thee this amount of gold, an abettor causes another to commit sahasa, the former shall be compelled to pay the promised amount of gold and a fine. But Kautilya holds that if an abettor extenuates his crime by pleading anger, intoxication or loss of sense (moham), he shall be punished as described above. ♦In all kinds of fines below a hundred pai.ias, the king shall take in addition to the fine 8 per cent more as rupa and in fines above one hundred, five per cent more as vyaji; these two kinds 193 of exaction are just, inasmuch as the people are full of sins on the one hand, and kings are naturally misguided on the other.

Likewise when a person is taunted for leprosy, lunacy, impotency and the like. Abusive expressions in general, no matter whether true, false, or reverse with reference to the abused, shall be punished with fines ranging above 12 papas, in the case of persons of equal rank- If persons abused happen to be of superior rank, the amount of the fines shall be doubled ; if of lower rank, it shall be halved. For caluniuiating the wives of others, the amount of4he fines shall be doubled. If abuse is due to carelessness, intoxication, or loss of sense, etc., the fines shall be halved.1 As to the reality of leprosy and lunacy, physicians or neighbours shall be authorities. As to the reality of impotency, women, the scum of urine, or the low specific gravity of faeces in water (the sinking of fa3ces in water) shall furnish the necessary evidence.4 (Speaking 111 of Habits) If among Brahmans, Kshatriyas, Vaisyas, Sudras, and outcastes (aut&vasayins), any one of a lower caste abuses the habits of one of 194 a k'l5ker caste, the fines imposed shall increase from 3 panas upwards (commencing from the lowest caste). If any one of a higher caste abuses one of a lower caste, fines imposed shall decrease from 2 panas.* Contemptuous expressions, such as “ a bad Brahman,” shall also be punished as above. The same rules shall apply to calumnies regarding learning 1 N. 15, 12. * M. 8. 274. * Y. 2, 204, 206, 214; the Munich Manuscript reads 44 Adanija,*’ no punishment. * N. 12. 10. * Y. 2, 206. 219 KAUTILYA’S A RT H AS ASTRA (sruta), the profession of buffoons (viigjivana), artisans, or musicians, and relating to nationalities, such as Prajjd^aka,1 Gandhara, etc. (Intimidation) If a person intimidates another by using such expressions as “ I shall render thee thus,” the bravado shall be punished with half as much fine as will be levied on him who actully does so. If a person, being unable to carry his threat into effect, pleads provocation, iutoxication, or loss of sense as his excuse, he shall be fined 12 panas. If a person capable to do harm and under the influence of enmity intimidates another, he shall be compelled to give life-long security for the well-being of the intimidated.’ ♦Defamation "of one’s own nation or village shall be punished with the first amercement; that of one’s own caste or assembly with the middlemost; and that of gods or temples (chaitya) with the highest amrecement.3 [Thus ends Chapter XVIII, ** Defamation,’ in Book III, Con¬ cerning Law ” of the Arthasastra of Kautilya.

If the same offence is committed above the navel, the fines shall be doubled ; and on the head, quadrupled. If the same offence is committed on persons of superior rank, the fines shall be twice as much : ami on persons of lower rank, half of the above fines. If the same offence is committed on the women of others, the fines shall be doubled.

Each one of a confederacy of persons who have inflicted hurt on another person shall be punished with double the usual fine. My preceptor holds that quarrels or assaults of a remote date shall not be complained of. But Kautilya bolls that there shall be no acquittal for an offender. My preceptor thinks that he who is the first to complain of a quarrel wins, inasmuch as it is pain that drives one to law. But Kautilya objects to it; for whether complaint is lodged first or last, it is the evidence of witnesses that must be depended upon. In the absence of witnesses, the nature of the hurt and other circumstances connected with the quarrel in question shall be evi¬ dences. Sentence of punishment shall be passed the ver) day that a defendant accused of assault fails to answer the charge made against him. (Robbery in Quarrels) A person stealing anything under the tumult of a quarrel shall be fined 10 papas.6 Destruction of articles of small value shall be punished with a Hue equal to the value of the articles besides the payment (to the sufferer) of an adequate compensation. Destruction of big things with a compensation equal to the value of the articles and a fine equal to twice the value. In the case of destruction of such things as clothes, gold, gold coins, and vessels or merchan¬ dise, the first amercement together with the value of the articles shall be levied. Causing damage to a wall of another man s house by knocking shall be fined 3 panas: breaking open or demolishing the same shall be fined 6 panas besides the restoration of the wall Throwing harmful things inside the house of a man shall be 1Q- fined 12 panas; and throwing such things as endanger the lives of the inmates shall be punished with the first amerce* ment.s For causing pain with sticks, etc., to minor quadrupeds, one or « Vi. 5, 75 i M . 8. 287. tand » Y. 2. 221. « Y. 2, 224. * 222 KAPTI hYA *8 \RTIr AS jtaTtf A tun pattit shall lit: 3nviii*d ; and for canning Mood to the.

Yet gamblers are naturally false players. The superintendents of gambling shall, therefore, be honest and supply dice at the rate of a kaka^i of hire per pair. Substitution by tricks of hand of dice other than thus supplied shall be punished with a fine of 12 panas. A false player shall not only be punished with the first amercement and fines leviable for theft and deceit, but also be made to forfeit the stakes he has won. The superintendent shall take not only 5 per cent of the stakes won by every winner, and the hire payable for supplying dice and other accessories of dice play, but also the fee chargeable for supply¬ ing water and accommodation, besides the charge for license. He can at the same time carry on the transactions of sale or mortgage of things. If he does not forbid tricks of hand and other deceitful practices, he shall be punished with twice the amount of the fine (levied from the deceitful gamblers). The same rules shall apply to betting and challenging, except those in learning and art.1 (Miscellaneous Offences) \ As regards miscellaneous offences : When a person does not return in required place or time the property he has borrowed or hired, or placed in his custody as a deposit, sits under the shade for more than one and a quarter of an hour (a yima) as prescribed, evades under the excuse of being a Brahman the payment due while passing military stations or cross¬ ing rivers, and bawls out or invites others to fight against his neighbours, he shall be punished with a fine o' 12 panas. When a person does not hand over the property entrusted to him for delivery to a third person, drags with his hmd the wife of his brother, has connection with a public woman kept by another, sells merchandise that is under ill repute, breaks open the sealed door of a house, or causes hurt to any of the forty-house-holders or neighbours, a fine of 48 panas shall be imposed. When a person misappropriates the revenue he collects as the .

When an unauthorised person examines (an offender) on oath, executes government work though not a government servant, renders minor quadrupeds impotent, or causes abortion to a female slave by medicine, he shall be punished with the first amercement.* When between father and son, husband and wife, brother and sister, maternal uncle and nephew or teacher and student, one abandons the other while neither of them is an apostate ; and when a person abandons in the centre of a village another person whom he hrought there for his own help, the first amercement shall be levied. When a person abandons his companion in the midst of a forest, he shall he punished with the middlemost amercement. When a person threatens and abandons his companion in the midst of a forest, he shall be punished with the highest amercement. Whenever persons who have started together on some journey abandon one another as above, half of the above fine shall be levied. When a person keeps or causes to keep another person in illegal confinement, releases a prisoner from prison, keeps, or causes another to keep, a minor in confinement, he, shall be punished with a fine of 1,000 patyis.* The rates of fines shall vary in accordance with the rank of persons concerned and the gravity of the crimes. Such persons as a pilgrim, an ascetic engaged in penance, a diseased person, any one suffering from hunger, thirst, or fatigue from journey, a villager from country parts, any one that has suffer¬ ed much from punishment and a moneyless pauper shall be shown mercy. Such transactions as pertain to gods, Brahmans, ascetics, women, 200 m*norS' a8e(* Person9> diseased persons and helpless crea¬ tures shall, though not be complained of, be settled by the judges themselves ; and in such transactions as the above, excuses due to time, place, or possession shall not be pleaded.

Physicians with their medicines, and as¬ cetics and prophets with their auspicious and purificatory ceremonials shall also overcome pestilences. The same remedial measures shall be taken against epidemics (maraka = killer). Besides the above measures, oblations to gods, the ceremonial called Mahakachchlm- vardhana, milking the cows on cremation or burial grounds, burning the trunk of a corpse, and spending nights in devotion to gods shall also be observed. With regard to cattle diseases (pasuvyadhinuirakv), not only the ceremony of waving lights in cow-sheds (nlrajanam) shall be hulf doue, but also the worship of family gods be carried out. (Famines) During famine, the king shall show favour to his people by providing them with seeds and provision (bijabhaktopagraham). He may either do such works as are usually resorted to in calamities ;* he may show favour by distributing either his own collection of provisions or the hoarded income of the rich among the people ; or seek for help from his friends among kings.

Ascetics and prophets may perform auspicious ceremonials. On new and full moon days rats may be worshipped. Similar measures may also be taken against the danger from locusts, birds and insects. (Snakes) [\\ hen there is fear from snakes, experts in applying remedies against snake poison shall resort to incantations and medicines ; or they inay destroy snakes in a body ; or those who are learned in the Atharvaveda may perforin auspicious rites.

Having opened the doors seemingly with the power of incanta¬ tion, the youths may be asked to get in. Having, in the midst of wakeful watchmen under concert, rendered the youths invisible with incantation, they may be asked to go into the interior. Having caused the watchmen sAmingly sleepy, the youths may, as ordered, move the beds of the watchmen with no hesitation. Persons under the guise of others’ wives may seemingly, under the influence of incantation, please the youths. Soon after the youths have actually experienced the powers of incantation, they may be taught the recitation and other accessory procedure of that art. They may afterwards be asked to test the power of their new learning in plundering such houses as contain articles or money with marks of identification, and simultaneously caught hold of in the very act. They may either be arrested while selling, purchasing, or mortgaging articles with marks of identifica¬ tion, or caught hold of while uuder intoxication brought about by medicinal drinks (vogasuramatta). From these youths thus arrested may be gathered information regarding the past life of them and of their accomplices. Spies under the disguise of old and notorious thieves may similarly associate with robbers and, instituting similar measures, cause the latter to be arrested.1 The collector-general shall exhibit these arrested robbers and announce to the public that their arrest is due to the instructions obtained from the king, who has learnt the divine art of catching robbers: “ I shall similarly catch hold of other robbers again aud again, and you, people, ought to prevent any one of your own kins¬ men from his wicked deeds.” Whoever is known, through the information of spies, to have been a robber of yoking ropes, whips and other (agricultural) 214 implements may be arrested and told that his arrest is due to the omniscient power of the king. Spies under the disguise 1 M. 9, 267. 241 KACTILYA’S arthasastra of old and notorious robbers, herdsmen, hunters, or keepers of hounds may mix themselves with criminal tribes living in forests, and conspire with them to attack villages or caravansaries which, according to previous plan, contain plenty of counterfeit gold and other articles. During the tumult, they may be killed by armed men concealed for the purpose. Or on their securing plenty of stolen treasure, the robbers may either be mode to eat such food as is mixed with the intoxicating juice of madana plant, or caught hold of either while sleeping with fatigue caused by incessant movements, or while under intoxication due to the drinking of medicinal beverage on the occasion of religious festivals. *The collector-general shall exhibit in public these and other arrested criminals, and proclaim the omniscient power of the king among the people at large- [Thus ends Chapter V, M Detection of Youths of Criminal Ten¬ dency by Ascetic Spies,” in Book IV, “ The Removal of Thorns ” of the Arthasastra of Kaufcilya. End of the eighty-second chapter from the beginning.] CHAPTER VI Seizure of Criminals on Suspicion or in the Very Act In addition to the measures taken by spies under the guise of prophets, such steps as are suggested by suspicious movements or possession of stolen articles may also be taken. • .. «... (Suspicion) Persons whose family subsist on slender means of inheritance ; who have little or no comfort; who frequently change their residence, caste and the names, not only of themselves, but also of their family (gotra); who conceal their own avocations and calls ; who'have betaken themselves to such luxurious modes of life as eating flesh and condiments, drinking liquor, wearing scents, gar¬ lands, fine dress, and jewels ; who have been squandering away their money ; who constantly move with profligate women, gamblers, or vintners ;* who frequently leave their residence ; whose commercial transaction, journey, or destination is difficult to understand ; who * X. 14, 18. 16 242 KAUTILYA’S ARTHASASTRA travel alone in such solitary places as forests and mountainous tracts ; who hold secret meetings in lonely places near to, or far from, their residence ; who hurry ou to get their fresh wounds or boils cured : who always hide themselves in the interior of their house ; who are excessively attached to women ; who are always inquisitive to gather information us to the women and property of others ; w ho associate themselves with men of condemnable learning and wrork; who l°^er in the dark behind walls or under shades ; who purchase rare or suspicious articles in suspicious times or places ; who are known for their inimical dealings ; whose caste and avocation are very low ; w ho keep false appearances or put on different caste signs ; w'ho change their ancestral customs under false excuses ; whose notoriety is already marked ; who, though in charge of villages, are terribly afraid of appearing before the prime minister and conceal themselves or go elsewhere ; who pant in fear while sitting alone ; who show undue agitation or palpitation of heart; whose face is pale and dry while the voice is indistinct and stammer¬ ing ; w’ho always move in company with armed men ; or who keep threatening appearance ; these and other persons may be suspected to be either murderers or robbers or offenders guilty of misappro¬ priation of treasure trove or deposits or to be any other kind of kuaves subsisting by foul means secretly employed.* Thus the seizure of criminals on suspicion is dealt with. (Seizure of Stolen Articles) As regards the seizure of criminals in the very act : Information regarding such articles as are either lost or stolen shall, if the articles are not found out, be supplied to those who trade in similar articles. Traders who conceal the articles as to the loss of which they have already received information shall be condemned as abettors. If they are found not to be aware of the loss, they may be acquitted ou restoring the articles. No person shall, writhout giving information to the superinten¬ dent of commerce, mortgage or purchase for himself any old or second-hand article. On receiving information regarding the sale of mortgage of old articles, the superintendent shall ask the owner how he came by it. He may reply : It has been inherited ; it has been received from a third person ; it is purchased by himself ; or it has been made to 11\\ 14. is. KAUTILYA'S ARTHASASTRA 243 order ; or it is a secret pledge ; he may definitely state the time and place when and where it came into being. Or he may adduce evidence as to the price and commission Ikshapamfilyara) for which it was purchased. If his statement regarding the antecedent circum¬ stances of the article is found to be true, he shall be let off. If the article in question is found to be the one lost by another person whose deposition regarding the antecedent circumstances of the article in no way differs from the previous story, the article shall be considered to belong to that persou who is found to have long been enjoying it and whose life is very pure. For while even quadrupeds and bipeds are found to bear such common evidences of identification as colour, gait and form, can there be any difficulty in identifying such articles as, in the form of raw materials, jewels, or vessels, are the product of a single source, definite materials, a particular manufacturer for a definite purpose ? The possessor of an article in question may plead that the article is either borrowed or hired, a pledge or a sealed deposit, or one obtained from a particular person for retail 216 sale. If he proves his allegation by producing the referee, he shall be let off; or the referee may deny having had any concern in the matter. With regard to the reasons which a person, seized with an article lost by another, assigns as to his having taken the article as a gift from a third person, he shall corroborate them by producing as witnesses not only those who gave and caused to give the article to him, but also those who, being mediators, custodians, bearers, or witnesses, arranged for the transfer of the article. When a person is found possessed of an article which he alleges to have been thrown out, lost, or forgotten by a third person, he shall prove his innocence by adducing evidence as to the time, place, and circumstances of finding the article. Otherwise he shall restore the article, besides paying a fine equal to its value ; or he may be punished as a thief.1 Thus the seizure of criminals in the very act is dealt with. (Circumstantial Evidence) As regards the seizure of criminals on the clue of circumstantial evidence : • Y. 269. 244 KAPpILYA'S AHTHA^iSTRA Tn caws uf butimn breaking and the.ft th« eltOtilUitwiioss, snob. as irntranrm ami erit effected through other than doom ; breaking the door by im-mi* of special coiiLfivniit^i, breaking th»fc window* mlh or without lattice work, or pullmg off the roof in holism consisting of upstair*, ami?mhnp and dWHHading upstairs; breaking the wall ; tunnel Ling; such contrivances us are neciititliy to carry off the trtNiiHurn sncrntly hoard art, in formation about which cun only be gathered from interna] sources; these Ukd Other accessory eircuui jitunceri of wear ami tear cognisable in the interior ill a] I tend to indicate the concern of internal hands in the crime, aojJ tbo&e of revere- nuttiru, eJtLeriud tgeuoiex Tk* blending of 1\ivav two kind? o] cirenmiatancttg n tin 11 indicate both internal and external u^Mintiui* Kegnrdiug crime* Mi*pocfed to be the work of internal agencies: Any person of mintiruble appearance, present on the occasion, lyomciaTei! with rogues or thieves, and possessed of such instruments as ary Hecemory for theft; n woruuu who ia born of a poor family, or has pin end her affections. elsewhere l servanw of similar eond cm li¬ able character ; any person addicted to too much sleep or who in suffering from want of alucp; any ^rson who shews rigne of fatigue! or whose face ie pile md dry, with voice atu tit muring end indistinct, and who may be watching the movements of others or bewailing Luo much ; any person whose body bears The signs of Mining heights; any person whose body appears to have been scratched or wounded with draft torn off ; any one whoa* legs and heads bear the *igns of rubbing and scratching ; any one whopc hnir ami itaih are cither full of din or fraahtv broken ; any one who his just bathed ami daubed his body with sandal; any one who- has :»men red his bod v with oil and has just washed Jih hands and Jeus ; any one whose footprints os a he identified with tlioM tnatle near the house during ingre^ or ograss ; any ane trbose broken fraLrnival* of garlands., sandal or dress can lie ideatitled with tlnww thrown out in or near the house during entrance or exit; any person the soldi of whose sweat or drink can he Ascertained from the fragments of his d?w thrown out in or near the house”these mid other persona shell he flitmiciBd.

Persons who charge an innocent man with theft, or conceal a thief, shall themselves be liable to the punishment for theft. Wheu a person accused of theft proves in his defence the com¬ plainant’s enmity or hatred towards himself, he shall be acquitted. Any person who keeps an innocent man in confinement (pari- vasayatah suddham) shall be punished with the first amercement. Guilt aguinst a suspected person shall ‘be established by the production of such evidences as the instruments made \ise of bv the accused, his accomplices or abettors, the stolen article, and any middlemen involved in selling or purchasing the stolen article. The validity of the above evidences shall also be tested with reference to both the scene of the theft and the circumstances connected with the possession and distribution of the stolen article. W hen there are no such evidences and when the accused is wailing much, he shall be regarded as innocent. For owing to one's accidental presence on the scene of theft, or to ones accidental resemblance to the real thief in respect to his appearauce, his dress, his weapons, or possession of articles similar to those stolen, or owing to one’s presence uear the stolen articles, as in the case of Mapdavya, who under the fear of torture admitted himself to be the thief, one, though innocent, is often seized as a thief. Hence the production of conclusive evidences shall be insisted upon.

The same proceedings will explain the quarrel fraudulently caused to crop up between any two seditious ministers, in whose family a son or a father has had sexual intercourse with a daughter- in-law, or a brother with the wife of another brother. A spy may flatter to the vanity of a seditious minister’s son of gentle manners and dignified conduct, by telling him, “ Though thou art the king s son, thou art kept here in fear of enemies.” The king may secretly honour this deluded person and tell him that, apprehending danger from the minister, I have put off thy installa¬ tion, though thou hast attained the age of heir apparent/* Then the spy may instigate him to murder the minister. The task beiug accomplished, he, too, may be put to death in the same spot, under the plea that he is a parricide. A mendicant woman, having ciptivated the wife of a seditious minister by administering such medicines as excite the feelings of love, may through that wife contrive to poison the minister. hailing these measures, the king may send a seditious minister 239 army of inefficient soldiers and fiery spies to put down a rebellious wild tribe or a village, or to set up a new superintendent of countries or of boundaries in a locality bordering upon a wilderness, or to bring under control a highly rebellious city, or to fetch a caravan bringing in the tribute due to the king from a neighbouring country. In an affray (that ensues in consequence of the above mission) either by day or at night, the fiery spies or spies under the guise of robbers (pratirodhaka), may murder the minister and declare that he was killed in the battle. While marching against an enemy or being engaged in sports, the king may send for his seditious ministers for an interview. W hile leading the ministers to the king, fiery spies with concealed weapons shall, in the middle enclosure of the king’s pavilion, offer themselves to be searched for admittance into the interior, and, when caught with their weapon* by the door-keepers, declare themselves to be the accomplices of the seditious ministers.

Similarly the other party may be instructed to curb the spirit of the above person. When a quarrel arises between the two parties at work, fiery spies under cover may throw their weapons and murder the seditious person ; and others are to be arrested and punished for the crime. When with reference to boundaries, field-produce, and boundaries of houses, or with reference to auy damage done to things, instru¬ ments, crops, and beasts of burden, or on occasions of witnessing spectacles and processions, any dispute, real or caused by fiery spies, arises in seditious towns, villages, or families, fiery spies may 241 weaP0DS ant* say : ** is what is done to them who quarrel with this man ” ; and for this offence others may be punished. When there arises a quarrel among seditious persons, fiery spies may set fire to their fields, harvest grounds, and houses, hurl weapons on their relatives, friends and beasts of burden, and say that they did so at the instigation of the seditious; and for this offence others may be punished. Spies may induce seditious persons in forts or in country parts to be each other’s guests at a dinner in which poisoners may administer poison ; and for this offence others may be punished. A mendicant woman may delude a seditious chief of a district into the belief that the wife, daughter, or daughter-in-law of anotheT seditious chief of another district loves the former. She may take the jewellery which the deluded chief gives her (for delivery to the wife, daughter, etc.), and, presenting it before the other chief, narrate that this chief in the pride of his youth makes love to the other s wite, daughter, or daughter-in-law. When at night a duel arises between the two chiefs, etc., as before. The prince or the commander of the army may confer some benefit upon such inimical persons as have been cowed down bv a seditious army, and may declare his displeasure against them after¬ wards. And then some other persons, who are equally cowed down by another seditious army of the king, may be sent against the former along with an army of inefficient soldiers and fiery spies. Thus all the measures to get rid of seditious persons are of the same type.

End of the ninety-first chapter from the beginning.] CHAPTER II Replenishment of the Treasury The king who finds himself in a great financial trouble and needs money, mav collect (revenue by demand). In such parts of his country as depend solely upou rain for water and are rich in grain, he may demand of his subjects one-third or one-fourth of their grain, according to their capacity. He shall never demand of such of his subjects as live in tracts of middle or low quality ; nor of people who are of great help in the construction of fortifications, gardens, buildings, roads for traffic, colonisation of waste lands, exploitation of mines, and formation of forest preserves for timber and elephants ; nor of people who live on the border of his kingdom or who have not enough subsistence. He shall, on the other hand, supply with grain and cattle those who colonise waste lands. He may purchase for gold one-fourth of what remains, after deducting as much of the grain as is required for seeds and subsistence of his subjects. He shall avoid the property of forest tribes, as well as of Brahmans learned in the Vedas (srotriya). He may purchase this, too, offering favourable price (to the owners). Failing these measures, the servants of the collector-general may prevail upon the peasantry to raise summer crops. Saying that double the amount of fines will be levied from those w ho are guilty (among peasants), they (the king’s employees) shall sow seeds in sowing seasons.

When wanting in money, the king may give forest pro- 2^ duce, cattle, or fields, along with a small amount of money. If he is desirous to colonise waste land, he shall make payments in money alone ; and if he is desirous of regulating the affairs of all villages equally, then he shall give no village to any (of his servants). Thus the king shall not only maintain his servants, but also increase their subsistence and wages in consideration of their learning and work.

Thus not only is there afforded au opportunity for the sale of the king's merchandise, but also is there a way opened fo a good return for the wages paid. • Thus, when both the receipts and expenditure are properly cared for, the king will never find himself in financial or military difficulties.

He shall sit by the side of, and close to, the king, and Jar from the seat of another courtier. He shall avoid speaking slyly against the opinion of any member of the assembly ; he shall never make incredible or false statements ; nor loud laughter with no cause for jest, and loud noise and spittle. He shall also avoid talking to another in secret, mutual conversation with another in the assembly (of ministers), appearing in royal dress * in the public, haughtiness, buffoonery, open request for gems and promotions, seeing with one eye, biting the lips, brow-beating, inter¬ rupting the king while speaking, enmity with a strong party, association with women, pimps, messengers of foreign kings, enemies, inimical parties, dismissed officers, and wicked people, stubborn adherence to a single purpose, and contact with any con¬ federacy of meu. •Without losing the opportune moments, he should speak of 2j-j the king’s interest; of his own interests when in company with persons friendly to him ; and of others’ interests in a suitable time and place, and in conformity to the principles of righteousness and economy. •When asked, he should tell the king what is both good and pleasing, but not what is bad, though pleasing ; if the king is pleas¬ ed to listen, he may secretly tell what, though unpleasant, is good. •He may even keep silence, but should never describe what is hateful ; by abstaining from talking of what the king hates, even undesirable persons have become powerful when, seeing that the king likes only pleasant things without caring for their evil conse¬ quences, they have followed his will. •While laughing in jest, he should avoid loud laughter ; he shall avoid evil aspersions against others, nor ascribe evil to others ; he shall forgive evil done to himself and have as much forbearance as the earth. •Self-protection shall be the first and constant thought of a wise man ; for the life of a man under the service of a king is aptly compared to life in fire ; whereas fire burns a part or the whole of the body, if at all, the king has the power either to destroy or to KAUTII.YA’S AKTHASASTRA 281 advance the whole family, consisting of sons and wives of his servants.'

End of the ninety-fourth chapter from the beginuing.1 CHAPTER V Time-serving When employed as a minister, he (the courtier) shall show the net revenue that remains after all kinds of expenditure are met with. He shall also give the exact particulars—os this is thus -of what- ever work is external, internal, secret, open, costly,. or negligible. He shall follow the king in his pursuits after hunting, gambling, drinking, and sexual pleasures. Ever attending upon the king, he shall, by flattery, endeavour toarrest his fall into evil habits and save him from the intrigues, plots and deceptions of enemies. He shall also endeavour to read the mind and appearance of the king. By way of collecting his wandering thoughts into a resolve, the king exhibits in his appearance and movements his inclination, anger, pleasure, sorrow, determination, fear, and change in the pairs of opposite feelings. ** I3v cognising wisdom in others, he is pleased , he attends to the speech of others; he gives a seat; allows himself to be seen in private ; does not suspect in places of suspicion ; takes delight in conversation ; spontaneously looks to things without being reminded; tolerates what is said agreeably to reason ; orders with smiling face ; touches with the hand ; does not laugh at what is commendable ; commends the qualities of another behind him ; remembers (the courtier) while taking luncheon ; engages himself in sports accompanied by (the courtier) ; consults (thecourtier) *hen in trouble; honours the followers of the courtier; reveals the secret ; honours the courtier more and more ; gives him wealth ; and averts his troubles ;—these are the signs of the king s satisfaction (with the courtier). • Kt. V. 282 KAUTILYA’S ARTHASASTRA The revere of the above indicates his (the king’s) displeasure. Still, we shall describe them in plain terms: Angry appearance when the courtier is in sight; evading or refusal to hear his speech; no inclination to give him a seat or to 253 8ee I change in syllables and accents while talking to him; seeing with one eye; brow-beating; biting the lips; rise of sweat; hard breathing and smiliug with no palpable cause ; talking to himself; sudden bending or raising of the body ; touching the body or the seat of another; molestation to another ; contempt of lcurning, caste, and country (of the courtier) ; condemnation of a colleague of equal defects ; condemnation of a man of opposite defects; condemnation of his opponent; failure to acknowledge his good deeds ; enumeration of his bad deeds; attention to whoever enters into the chamber ;* too much gift ; uttering falsehood ; change in the conduct and attitude of visitors to the king; nay, the courtier shall also note the change in the life of animals other than men. Katyayana holds that this (king) showers his favours broadcast. Kai.iii.ka Bharadvaja says that KrauTicha (a bird) has moved from right to left. Charayapa says that this iking) is a long stalk of grass. Ghoiamukha says that (he is like) a wet cloth. Knjalka says that (he is like) an elephant pouring over water. Pbuna is of opinion that one should declare him to be a chariot horse. The sou of Pisuna says that mortification ensues when his opponent is courted.' When wealth and honour are discontinued, such a king may be abandoned ; or by recognising the character of the king as well as his own defects, he may rectify himself; or he may seek the protection of one of the best friends of the king. •Living with the king’s friend, the courtier has to endeavour to remove, through the medium of his own friends, the defects of his ! r » o | ,*" , 1 'Hie meaning of the above seven passnges is illustrated by a story* told of tome prince* who. in vjew of indicating danger to the life of their teacher from the king, their father placed a long nalk of grass across the threshold of the dining-room ai\d said that a crouncha bird moved from right to left, and that the garment which hewanted to wear before going to dine with them was still wet.

Of these, the best qualities of the king are : Born of a high family, godly, possessed of valour, seeing through the medium of aged persons, virtuous, truthful, not of a contradictory nature, grateful, having large aims, highly enthusiastic, not addicted to procrastination, powerful to control his neighbouring kings, of resolute mind, having an assembly of ministers of no mean quality, and possessed of a taste for discipline—these are the quali- ties of an inviting nature. Inquiry, hearing, perception, retention in memory, reflection, deliberation, inference and steadfast adherence to conclusions are the qualities of the intellect. Valour, determination of purpose, quickness, and probity are the aspects of enthusiasm. Possessed of a sharp intellect, strong memory, and keen mind, energetic, powerful, trained in all kinds of arts, free from vice, capable of paying in the same coin by way of awarding punishments or rewards, possessed of dignity, capable of taking remedial measures against dangers, possessed of foresight, ready to avail himself of opportunities when afforded in respect of place, time, and c manly efforts, clever enough to discern the causes necessitat- ing the cessation of treaty or war with an enemy, or to lie iu wait keeping treaties, obligations and pledges, or to avail himself of his enemy's weak points, making jokes with no loss of dignity or secrecy, never brow-beating and casting haughty and stern looks, free from passion, anger, greed, obstinacy, fickleness, haste and back-biting habits, talking to others with a smiling face, and observ¬ ing customs as taught by aged persons such is the nature of self- possession. 288 KAUTII/VWS ARTHASASTRA I The qualifications of a minister have been described in the beginning,* middle,* and at the close'1 of the work. Possessed of capital cities both in the centre and the extremities of the kingdom, productive of subsistence not only to its own people, but* also to outsiders on occasions of calamities, repulsive to enemies, powerful enough to put down neighbouring kings, free from miry, rocky, uneven, and desert tracts, as well as from conspi¬ rators, tigers, wild beasts, and large tracts of wilderness, beautiful to look at, containing fertile lands, mines, timber and elephant forests, and pasture grounds, artistic, containing hidden passages, full of cattle, not depending upon rain for water, possessed of land and waterways, rich in various kinds of commercial articles, capable of bearing the burden of a vast army and heavy taxation, inhabited by agriculturists of good and active character, full of intelligent masters and servants, and with a population noted for its loyalty and good character—these are the qualities of a good country. The excellent qualities of forts have already been described.4 Justly obtained either by inheritance or by self-acquisition, rich in gold and silver, filled with an abundance of big gems of various colours and of gold coins, and capable to withstand calamities of long duration is the best treasury. Coming down directly from father and graudfather (of the king), ever strong, obedient, happy in keeping their sons and wives well contented, not averse to making a long soj< urn, ever and everywhere invincible, endowed with the power of endurance,'trained in fighting various' kinds of battles, skilful iu handling vurious forms of weapons, ready to share in the weal or woe of the king, and conse¬ quently not falling foul with him, and purely composed of soldiers of Kshatriya caste, is the best army. Coming down directly from father and grandfather, longstanding, open to conviction, never falling foul, and capable of making prepa¬ rations for war quickly and on a large scale, is the best friend. Not born of a royal family, greedy, possessed of a mean assembly of ministers, with disloyal subjects, ever doing unrighteous acts, of loose character, addicted to mean pleasures, devoid of enthusiasm, 259 trU8t'D8 ^at€» indiscreet in action, powerless, helpless, impotent and ever injurious, is the worst enemy.

If any two kings, hostile to each other, find the time of achieving the results of their respective works to be equal, they shall make peace with each other. * No king shall keep that form of policy, which causes him the loss of profit from his own works, but which entails no such loss on the enemy ; for it is deterioration. Whoever thinks that in the course of time his loss will be less than his acquisition as contrasted with that of his enemy, may neg¬ lect his temporary deterioration.' If any two kings, hostile to each other, and deteriorating, expect to acquire equal amount of wealth in equal time, they shall make peace with each other. * That position in which neither progress nor retrogression is seen is stagnation. Whoever thinks his stagnancy to be of a shorter duration and his prosperity in the long run to be greater than his enemy’s may neg¬ lect his temporary stagnation.* M v teacher says that if any two kings, who are hostile to each other, and are in a stationary condition, expect to acquire equal amount of wealth and power in equal time, they shall make peace with each other. “ Of course, M says Kautilya, “ there is no other alterna¬ tive.” 265 Or if a king thinks : “ That keeping the agreemept of peace, I can undertake produc¬ tive works of considerable importance and destroy at the same time those of my enemy ; or apart from enjoying the results of my own works, I shall also enjoy those of my enemy in virtue of the agree¬ ment of peace ; or I can destroy the works of my enemy by employ¬ ing spies and other secret means; or by holding out such induce¬ ments as a happy dwelling, rewards, remission of taxes, little work and large profits and wages, I can empty ray enemy's country of its population, with which he has been able to carry bis own works : or being allied with a king of considerable power, my enemy will have his own works destroyed; or’I can prolong my enemy’s hostility with another king whose threats have driven my enemy to seek my pro¬ tection ; or being allied with me* my enemy can harass the. country K A DflL V A'S A Hr H AbAHTHA 2B5 «f another king who hates me: or oppnmd by another king, the «ihj*ct* tif my enemy will immigrate into my country, and l e»r, lhrr.-r-.re, achieve the results i>r my own works very .'/wily ; or being in a prei-aHon* condition due to the destrnction of his works, my enemy will not be no powerful *» to attack me or by exploiting my own resources in affiance with any two (friendly) kings. ! e«i augment my resource.* ; or if * Circle of State* formed by my enemy us one of its members, I ran divide them and combine with the others; oi by tliresta or favour, l can catch hold of my enemy nod when be desires to b* » member of my Mn Circle o| Hiatus, I can mekf him incur the d is pleasure of the Other members and fall a victim lo their own fury"—if a king thinks thus, th«n be may increase hi* resources by keeping peace.

Which is to be marched against—an assailable enemy involved in troubles to a greater degree or a strong enemy troubled to a lesser degree ? My teacher says that, as a matter of easy conquest, the assailable •neiny under worse troubles should be marched against first. Not so. says Kautilya : the conqueror should march against the strong enemy under less troubles, for the troubles of the strong enemy, though less, will.be augmented when*attacked. True, that the worse troubles of the assailable enemy will be still worse when attacked. But when left to himself, the strong enemy under less troubles will endeavour to get rid of his troubles and unite with the assailable enemy or with another enemy in the rear of the conqueror* • When there are two assailable enemies, one of virtuous character and under worse troubles, and another of vicious character under less troubles, and with disloyal subjects, which of them is to be marched against first ? When the enemy of virtuous character and under worse troubles is attacked, his subjects will help him ; whereas, the subjects of the other vicious character and under less troubles will be indifferent. Disloyal or indifferent subjects will endeavour to destroy even a strong king. Hence the conqueror should march against that enemy whose subjects are disloyal.

Better to march with two kings of lesser power ; for the conqueror can depute them to carry out any two different works and keep them under his control. When the desired end is achieved, the inferior king will quietly retire after the satisfaction of his superior. ♦Till his discharge, the good conduct of an ally of usually bad character should be closely scrutinised, either suddenly coming out at a critical time from a covert position (sattra) to examine his conduct, or by having his wife as a pledge for his good conduct. ♦Though actuated with feelings of true friendship, the conqueror has reason to fear his ally though of equal power, when the latter attains success in his mission ; having succeeded in his mission, an ally of equal power is likely to change his attitude even towards the conqueror of superior power. ♦An ally of superior power should not be relied upon, for pros- perity changes the mind. Even with little or no share in the spoils, an ally of superior power may go back, appearing contented ; but some time afterwards, he may not fail to sit on the lap of the conqueror and carry off twice the amount of share due to him. ♦Having been satisfied with mere victory, the leading conqueror should discharge his allies, having satisfied them with their shares he may allow himself to be conquered by them instead of attempting to conquer them (in the matter of spoils); it is thus that a king can win the good graces of his Circle of States. [Thus ends Chapter V, “ Consideration about Marching against an Assailable Enemy and a Strong Enemy ; Causes Leading to the Dwindling, Greed, and Disloyalty of the Army ; and Considerations about the Combination of Powers,” in Book VII, “ The End of the Six fold Policy” of the Arthasiistra of Kautilya. End of the hundred and third chapter from the beginning.) 308 KAlTpILYA’S AKTHA8ASTRA - CHAPTER VI The March ok Combined Powers ; Agreement of Peace WITH OR WITHOUT DEFINITE TERMS ; AND Peace with Renegades The conqueror should thus over-reach the second element (the enemy close to his territory) : He should engage his neigh¬ bouring enemy to undertake a simultaneous march with him and tell the enemy : “ Thou march in that direction, and I shall march in this direction ; and the share in the spoils is equal.” If the booty is to be equally divided, it is an agreement of peace ; if otherwise, it is overpowering the enemy. An agreement of peace may be made with promise to carry out a definite Wi>rk (paripanifca) or with no such promise (aparipanita). When the agreement is to the effect that, *' Thou march to that place, and I shall march to this place,” it is termed au agreement of peace to carry out a work in a definite locality. When it is agreed upon that, ” Thou be engaged so long, I shall be engaged thus long,” it is an agreement to attain an object in a fixed time. When it is agreed upon that, “ Thou try to accomplish that work, and I shall try to finish this work,” it is an agreement to achieve definite end. When the conqueror thinks that, “ My enemy (now au ally) has to march through an unknown country, which is intersected with mountains, forests, rivers, forts ana deserts, which is devoid of foodstuffs, people, pastural grounds, fodder, firewood and water, and which is far away, different from other countries, and not affording suitable grounds for the exercise of his army ; and I have to traverse a country of quite the reverse description,” then he should make an agreement to carry out a. work in a definite locality. When the conqueror thinks that, “ My enemy has to work with foodstuffs falling short and with no comfort during the raiuy, hot or cold season, giving rise to various kinds of diseases and obstructing the free exercise of his army during a shorter or longer period of time than necessary for the accomplishment of the work 2gQ in hand ; and I have to work during a time of quite the reverse nature,” then he should make time a factor of the agreement.

Or if he thinks that “ (my enemy) will neither capture my rear nor make an alliance with my assailable enemy against whom I am goiug to march ; I shall have double the strength with him, i.e. the enemy suing peace; (my ally) will not only facilitate the collection of my revenue and supplies and put down the internal enemies who are causing me immense trouble, but also punish wild tribes and their followers entrenched in their strongholds, reduce my assailable enemy to a precarious condition or compel him to accept the proffered peace, and having received as much profit as he desires, he will endeavour to endear my other enemies to me,** then the conqueror may proclaim war against one and make peace with another, and endeavour to get an army for money or money for the supply of an army from among his neighbouring kings. When the kings of superior, equal or inferior power make peace with the conqueror and agree to pay a greater, or equal, or less amount of profit in proportion to the army supplied, it is termed even peace ; that which is of the reverse character is styled uueven peace ; and when the profit is proportionally very high, it is termed deception (atisandhi). When a king of superior power is involved in troubles, or is 2S4 conie ?Hef or is afflicted ‘with misfortune, his enemy, though of inferior power, may request of him the help of his army in return for a share in the profit proportional to the strength of the army supplied.

End of the hundred and fifth chapter from the beginning.] CHAPTER VIII The Attitude of an Assailable Enemy ; and Friends that Deserve Help When an assailable enemy who is in danger of being attacked is desirous of taking upon himself the condition which led one king to be combined with another against himself, or of splitting them from each other, he may propose peace to one of the kings on the condition of himself paying twice the amount of profit accruing from the combination. The agreement having been made, he may describe to that king the loss of men and money, the hardship of sojourning abroad, the commission of sinful deeds, and the misery and other personal troubles to which that king would have been subjected. Wheu the king is convinced of the truth, the amount promised may be paid ; or having made that king to incur enmity with other kings, the agreement itself may be broken off. When a king is inclined to cause to another loss of men and money in the ill-considered undertakings of the latter, or to frustrate the latter in the attempt of achieving large profit from well-begun undertakings ; or when he means to strike another at his (another s) 3lft KAVjihXA-a ABTlUsASTKA own p trice or while marching ; of when he intends to eaaefc subsidy *^iii[i in conibinntiun with the hitter's assaibibfe enemy : orwht^n hr i? in need oF money m\] does not ]ike to tmat to hca ally, ho nahjr for the tiiii'j lnciraLjP be satisfied with u smell amount of profit. \\ fM-ri ?i king hoa m view the necejuiity of helping a fnend or nf destroying an enemy, of the possibility of acquiring much wraith (in return for th§ priorit. hsip)* or whfln he in touch to Utilise in fu* ure the xrviers of tho one bow* obliged by him* he may rejeft thfl offer of Zirgs profit at the present so pttfWQm of i mu nil gai n in future.

The hitter under these elre urns tan cea may demand for u procedure (fcrama) either at the present or in the future. The satne proved nre explains the oases treated oT before. The conqueror and Ida enemy helping their respective friends diffrf according a& their friend* arc such or are not surh as undertake pi^ilitr, praiseworthy or productive worka and as nrc re*Gluto in their tj rut* rink trigs and are provided with loyal and derated subjects- Whoever undertake f tolerable work h a beginner of poaiiibl* work : whoever undertaken nn tmbbrtnbhed work if a beginner of pruiieworthy work ; whoever undertake1- u wyrk of large profits in a hfffiaDer of a productive work ; whoever taken no reat be fore the completion of the work undertaken is a resold to worker; and whoever has loyal and devoted subjects is in u position to command help atul to hrin^ to a stirresaftil termination any work without losing anything itt the form of favour- When such friends are gr.iidird by ihe enemy or the conqueror, ther can he of immense help to him ;i friends of reverse eharaetor should never he helped- Of the t^op the conqueror and hi? enemy, both of whom may happen to have fnend in the patne person, he who helps a true of a truer friend over-retches ibe other ; for by helping a true friend 317 KAMpLYA'fJ AHTHASJLSTHA he enriches himself. while the other not only incurs Io*a of men oed motiey and the hardships of Sojourning abroad + hut oku shower* beueiilsi on an enemy who liuti* the benefactor nil thu mure for hia grati ficat ion.

When a king achieves this nr that object with the u^ijitiilfcce of a friend who is to receiver i he help of hia army in return Eater unr then he may semi out bis various kind* of army—each as hereditary srmy; hired anuyr army funned of corporations of people, hie friend% army ami th-> army composed of wild trib&s—either that kind of uriny which has expensive of all sorto of ground* and of deuAon# or the army of anemia or of wild tribes* which is far removed in space and time, When a king thinks that, “ Though euccesiful, my ally tmiy cause tuy army to move m no enemy's territory or in wild tract*.

Such is the nature of peace ami war.

End of the hundred and sixth chapter from the beginning.J CHAPTER IX Agreement for the Acquisition of a Friend or Gold Of the three gains, the acquisition of a friend, of gold, and of territory, accruing from the march of combined powers, that which is mentioned later is better than the one previously mentioned ; for friends and gold can be acquired by means of territory ; of the two gains, that of a friend and pf gold, each can be a means to acquire the other. Agreement under the condition, “ Let us acquire a friend, etc., is termed even peace; when one acquires a friend and the other gold or land, it is termed uneven peace ; and when one gains more than the other, it is deception. In an even peace (i.e. agreement on equal terms), whoe\tr acquires a friend of good character or relieves an obi friend from troubles, over-reaches the other; for help given in misfortune renders friendship very firm. Which is better of the two: a friend of loug-standing but unsubmissive nature, or a temporary friend of submissive nature, both being acquired by affording relief from their respective troubles ? My teacher says that a long-standing friend of unsubmissive nature is better, inasmuch as such a friend, though not helpful, will not create harm. Not so, says Kautiiya : a temporary friend of submissive nature is better ; for such a friend will be a true friend so long as he is helpful; for the real characteristic of friendship lies in giving help* 319 K AUTILYA'S AKTHA3ASTRA Which is the better of two submissive friends : a temporary friend of large prospects, or a long-standing friend of limited prospects ? My teacher says that a temporary friend of large prospects is better, inasmuch as such a friend can, in virtue of his large pros¬ pects, render immense service in a very short time, and can stand undertaking of large outlay. Not so, says Kautilya : a long-standing friend of limited pros¬ pects is better, inasmuch as a temporary friend of large prospects is likely to withdraw his friendship on account of material hiss in the shape of help given, or is likely to expect similar kind of help in return ; but a long-standing friend of limited prospects can, in virtue of his long-standing nature, render immense service in the long run. 290 Which is better, a big friend, difficult to be roused, or a small friend, easy to be roused ? My teacher says that a big friend, though difficult to he roused, is of imposing nature, and when he rises up he can accomplish the work undertaken. Not so, says Kautilya: a small friend easy to be roused is better, for such a friend will not, in virtue of his ready preparations, be behind the opportune moment of work, and can, iu virtue of his weakness in power, be used in any way the conqueror may like ; but not so the other of vast territorial power. Which is better, scattered troops, or an unsubmissive standing army ? My teacher says that scattered troops can be collected in time, as they are of submissive nature. Not so, says Kaurilya : an unsubmissive standing army is better, as it can be made submissive by conciliation and other strategic means; but it is not so easy to collect in time scattered troops, as they are engaged in their individual avocations. Which is better, a friend of vast population, or a friend of immense gold l My teacher says that a friend of vast population is better, iuas- tnuch as such a friend will be of imposing power and can, when he rises up, accomplish any work undertaken. Not so, says Kautilya : a friend possessing immense gold is better; for possession of gold is ever desirable ; but an army is not always required. Moreover, armies and other desired objects cau be purchased for gold. 320 KACTILYA’S arthasAstra Which is hotter, a frieud possessing gold or a friend possessing vast territory i My teacher says that a friend possessing gold can stand any heavy expenditure made with discretion. Not so, says Kaufcilya : for it has already been stated that both friends and gold can be acquired by means of territory. Hence a friend of vast territory is far better. When the friend of the conqueror and his enemy happen to 901 posses equal population, their people may yet differ in possession of qualities such as bravery, power of endurance, amicableness, and qualification for the formation of any kind of army. When the friends are equally rich in gold, they may yet differ in qualities such as readiness to comply with requests, magnanimous and munificent help, and accessibility at any time and always. About this topic, the following sayings are current: •Long-standing, submissive, easy to be roused, coming from fathers and grandfathers, powerful, and never of a contradictory nature, is a good friend ; and these are said to be the six qualities of a good friend ; •that friend who maintains friendship with disinterested motives and merely for the sake of friendship, and by whom the relationship acquired of old is kept iutact, is a long-standing friend ; •that friend whose munificence is enjoyable iu various ways is a submissive friend; and is said to be of three forms : one who is enjoyable only by one, one who is enjoyable by two (the enemy and the conqueror), and one who is enjoyable by all, is the third ; •that friend who, whether as receiving help or as giving help, lives with an oppressive hand over his enemies, ami who possesses a number of forts and a vast army of wild tribes is said to be a long¬ standing friend of unsubmissive nature : •that friend who, either when attacked or when iu trouble, makes friendship for the security of his own existence is a temporary and submissive friend ; •that friend who contracts friendship with a single aim in view and who is helpful, immutable, and amicable, is a friend never falling foul even in adversity ; •whoever » of an amicable nature is a true frieud ; whoever sides also with the enemy is a mutable friend : and whoever is indifferent to neither (the conqueror and his enemy) is a friend to both ; 321 K AUT11-Y A S A in II Afi ASTK A “that friend who in iniTiiiut to thm oonqmsrisr or wb® in equally 292 *“ tlL<-1 wnqteiort enemy it. u JulfiliAiI friend, whether hi: j.D giving htdp nr i£ capable of helping; * whoever h#l|iH the encniyV friend, proton » i *115 vulnerable person or a relation uf the ettejnj in & friend ctmiiutm to (both) ihv oneluv (and the conqueror) ; •whoever pofise&ses extensive and fertile territory and is root i-mt vdT Mronpp but indolent* will he iudifh'mit UoWurdv ltbi ally} whan tbm Utter becomes despicable under troubles; •whoever, owing tn Us own weakness, follow* the ascendancy of Initli the conqueror and inn enemy, not incurring feminity witij uitlisr, in known a* a eoiijniME friend ; •whoever Ektsgkuts a friuiid, who h being hurt* with or without reason, mid who seeks help, with or without nuun, despises bii own danger.

Of the two kings thus entering into an agreement, who¬ ever acquire/ a rich mod fertile Earn! with standing crops over readies *ha other* The acquisition of rich land being equal, whoever acquires sorb 21 322 KAUTILYA’S ARTHASiSTRA land by putting down a powerful enemy, over-reaches the other ; for not only does he acquire territory, but also destroys an enemy, and thereby augments his own power. True, there is beauty in acquiring land by putting down a weak enemy ; but the land acquired will also be poor, and the king in the neighbourhood, who has hitherto been a friend, will now become an enemy. The enemies being equally strong, he who acquires territory after beating a fortified enemy over-reaches the other ; for the capture of a fort is conducive to the protection of territory and to the destruc¬ tion of wild tribes. As to the acquisition of land from a wandering’ enemy, there is the difference of having a powerful or powerless enemy close to the acquired territory ; for the land which is close to a powerless enemy is easily maintained, while that bordering upon the territory of a powerful enemy has to be kept at the expense of men and money. Which is better, the acquisition of a rich land close to a constant enemy, or that of sterile land near to a temporary enemy ? My teacher says that a rich land with a constant enemy is better, inasmuch as it yields much wealth to maintain a strong army, by which the enemy can be put down. Not so, says Kautilya: for, a rich land creates many enemies, and the constant enemy will ever be an enemy, whether or not he is helped (with men and money to conciliate him); but a temporary enemy will be quiet either from fear or favour. That land, on the border of which there are a number of forts giving shelter to bands of thieves, Mlechchhas and wild tribes, is a land with a constant enemy ; and that which is ‘of reverse character is one with a temporary enemy. 2£4 Which is better, a small piece of land, not far, or an exten¬ sive piece of land, very far ? A small piece of land, not far, is better, inasmuch as it can be easily acquired, protected, and defended, whereas the other is of a reverse nature. Of the above two kinds of land, which is better, that which can be maintained by itself, or that which requires external armed force to maintain ! The former is better, as it can be maintained with the army and 1 Observe the difference between a wandering enemy (chata xatm) and an entrenched enemy (sthita satru).

End of the hundred and eighth chapter from the begin¬ ning.] CHAPTER XI Interminable Agreement The agreement made under the condition, “ Let us colonize waste land/* is termed an interminable agreement. Whoever of the two parties of the agreement colonizes a fertile land, reaping the harvest earlier, over-reaches the other. Which is better for colonization : a plain or a watery land ? A limited tract of land with water is far better than a vast plain, inasmuch as the former is conducive to the growth of crops and fruits throughout the year. Of plains, that which is conducive to the growth of both early 296 anc* ^ale croI s» and which requires less labour and less rain for cultivation, is better than the other of reverse character. Of watery lands that which is conducive to the growth of grains is better than another productive of crops other than grains. Of two watery tracts, one of limited area and conducive to the growth of grains, and another, vast and productive of crops other than grains, the latter is better, inasmuch as it affords vast area not only to grow spices and other medicinal crops, but also to construct forts and other defensive works in pleuty: for fertility and other qualities of lands are artificial (krtrimah). Of the two tracts of land, one rich in grains and another in mines, the latter helps the treasury while the former can fill both the treasury and the store-house ; and besides this, the construction of forts and other buildings requires grains. Still that kind of land containing mines and which yields precious metals to purchase large tracts of land is far better. My teacher says that of the two forests, one productive of 12% JEAUfll.T.t'5 ARTHAMNTJiA timber and ji nut her of elephant*, t Ej»- former in the mqtco of all kinds nf work* and ta of irniuenjte help in forming a storehouse, while tin* hitter ic of revere* rim ranter Nut bo, R&ye K-mtilya, for it b p< a&ible to plnnt any number of timber forest* in many placai, blit not an Hephanr Forest * yet it rs *“ L-lepbantfl that the dflAEructiori nf an erit-my * in my do pan da.

My teacher says that an indiscreet colonizer may sometimes betray the weak points of his employer, the conqueror- Hiit Kautilya says that, just as he betrays the weak points, so also does he facilitate his destruction by the conqueror. In the absence of such persons to colonize waste lands, the conqueror may arrange for the colonization of waste land in the same way as we shall treat of later on in connection with the “ Capture of an Enemy in the Rear/’1 The above is what is termed verbal agreement (abhihitasandhih). When a king of immense power compels another to sell a portion ef the litter’s fertile territory, of which the former is very fond, then the latter may make an agreement with the former and sell the land. This is what is termed “ unconcealed peace ” (anibhrtasandhih). When a king of equal power demands lands from another as above, then the latter may sell it after considering 44 Whether the land can be recovered by me, or can be kept under my control; whether my enemy can be brought under my power in consequence of his taking possession of the land ; and whether I can acquire by the sale of the land friends and wealth enough to help me in my undertakings.” This explains the case of a king of inferior power, who purchases lands. ♦Whoever, well versed in the science of polity, thus acquires friends, wealth, and territory, with or without population, will over¬ reach other kings in combination with him.

End of the hundred and ninth chapter from the beginning.! CHAPTER XII Agreement for Undertaking a Work When an agreement is made on the condition, Let ns have a fort built/' it is termed agreement for undertaking a work Whoever of the two kings builds an impregnable fortress on a spot naturally best fitted for the purpose with less labour and expenditure over-reaches the other. Of forts such as a fort on a plain, in the centre of a river, and on a mountain, that which is mentioned later is of more advantage than 299 °ne I>rev'0U8^v mentioned; of irrigation a I works (aetu- bandha), that which is of perennial water is better than that which is fed with water drawn from other sources ; and of works containing perennial water, that which can irrigate an extensive area is better. Of timber forests, whoever plants a forest which produces valuable articles, which expands into wild tracts, and which possesses a river on its border.over-reaches the other; for a forest containing a river is self-dependent and cart afford shelter in calamities. Of game forests, whoever plants a forest full of cruel beasts, close to an enemy’s forest containing wild animals, causing therefore much harm to the enemy, and extending into an elephant forest at the country's border, over-reaches the other. My teacher says that of the two countries, one with a large number of effete persons, and another with a small number of brave persons, the latter is better, inasmuch as a few brave persons can destroy a large mass of eifete persons, whose slaughter brings about the destruction of the entire army of their master. Not so, says Kautilya, a large number of effete persons is better, inasmuch as they can be employed to do other kinds of works in the camp : to serve the soldiers fighting in battlefields, and to terrify the enemy by its number. It is also possible to infuse spirit and enthusiasm in the timid by means of discipline and training. Of mines, whoever exploits with less labour and expenditure a 328 KAUTII.YA’S ARTHASASTRA mine of valuable output and of easy communication over-reaches the other. Which is better of the two, a small mine of valuable yields, or a big mine productive of commodities of inferior value ? My teacher says that the former is better, inasmuch as valuable products, such as diamonds, precious stones, pearls, corals, gold and silver, can swallow vast quantities of inferior commodities. Not so, says Kautilya, for there is the possibility of purchasing valuable commodities by a mass of accumulated articles of inferior value, collected from a vast and long-standing mine of inferior commodities. This explains the selection of trade routes : My teacher says that of the two trade routes, one by water aud another by laud, the former is better, inasmuch as it is less expen¬ sive but productive of large proiit. Not so, says Kautilya, for a water route is liable to obstruction* not permanent, a source of imminent dangers, and incapable of defence, whereas a land route is of reverse nature. Of water routes, one along the shore and another in mid-oceau, the route along aud close to the shore is better, as it touches at many tradiug port towns; likewise river navigation is better, as it is uninterrupted and is of avoidable or endurable dangers. My teacher says that of land routes, that which leads to the Himalayas is better than that which leads to the south. Not so, Kautilya, for with the exception of blankets, skins, and horses, other articles of merchandise, such as conch shells, diamonds^ precious sfcoues, pearls and gold are available in plenty in the south. Of routes leading to the south, either that trade route which traverses a large number of mines, which is frequented by people, and which is less expensive or troublesome, or that route by taking which plenty of merchandise of various kinds can be obtained is better. This explains the selection of trade routes leading cither to the east or to the wes* Of a cart-track and a footpath, a cart-track is better, as it affords facilities for preparations on a lurge scale. Routes that can be traversed by asses or camels, irrespective of countries and seasons, are also good. This explains the selection of trade routes traversed by men alone 329 KAUT ILYA’S ARTHASASTRA (amsa-patha, shoulder-path, i.e. a path traversed by men carrying merchandise on their shoulders). ♦It is a loss for the conqueror to undertake that kind of work 301 productive of benefits to the enemy, while a work of reverse nature is a gain. When the benefits are equal, the conqueror has to consider that his condition is stagnant. ♦Likewise it is a loss to undertake a work of less output and of a greater outlay, while a work of reverse nature is a g un. If the output and outlay of a work are at par, the conqueror has to consider that his condition is stagnant. ♦Hence the conqueror should find out such fort-building and other works as, instead of being expensive, are productive of greater profit and power. Such is the nature of agreements for undertaking works.

Six-fold Policy ” of the Artha^astra of Kautilya. End of the hundred aud tenth chapter from the beginning.] CHAPTER XIII Considerations about an Enemy in the Rear When the conqueror and his enem v simultaneously proceed to cap¬ ture the rear of their respective enemies who are engaged in an attack against others, he who captures the rear of one who is possessed of vast resources gains more advantage (atisandhatte); for one who is possessed of vast resources has to put down the rear-enemv only after doing away with one’s frontal enemy already attacked, but not one who is poor in resources and who has not realised the desired profits. Resources being equal, he who captures the rear of one who has made vast preparations gains more advantages, for one who has made vast preparations has to put down the enemy in the rear only after destroying the frontal enemy, but not one whose preparations are made on a small scale and whose movements are, therefore' obstructed bj the Circle of States. Preparations being equal, he who captures the rear of one who 330 KAUTILYA’S ARTHASASTRA has marched out with all the resources gains more advantages ; for one whose base is undefended is easy to be subdued, but not one who has marched out with a part of the army after having made arrangements to defend the rear. Troops taken being of equal strength, he who captures the rear of one who has gone against u wandering enemy gains more advantages: for one who has marched out against a wandering enemy has to put down the rear-enemy only after obtaining an easy victory over the wandering enemy ; but not one who has marched out against an entrenched enemy, for one who has marched out against the entrenched enemy will be repelled in his attack against the enemy’s forts and will, after his return, find himself between the rear-enemy and the frontal enemy who is possessed of strong forts. This explains the cases of other enemies described before.1 Enemies being of equal description, he who attacks the rear of one who has gone against a virtuous king gains more advantages, for ontf who has gone against a virtuous king will incur the displeasure of even his own people, whereas one who has attacked a wicked king will endear himself to all. This explains the consequences of capturing the rear of those who have marched against an extravagant king, or a king living from hand to mouth, or a niggardly king. The same reasons hold good in the case of those who have marched against their own friends. When there are two enemies, one engaged in attacking a friend and another an enemy, he who attacks the rear of the latter gains more advantages : for one who has attacked a friend will, after easily making peace with the friend, proceed against the rear enemy ; for it is easier to make peace with a friend than with an enemy. 1 Mr. Meyer takes the won! ntisandliarac in this and other paragraphs in the sense of stisandhiyate and translates it. **hat den nach teil,” gets intodisadvan- tngc. He eeeraa to think that the conqueror rapturing the rear of rather a powerful than a weak enemy will himself be attacked by tbc powerful enemy and he will thus get into trouble. But in the view of tbe author the chief aim of the eonqueror oukht to be the seizing of the land in the rear of the enemy's country, as clearly stated in the third paragraph. There he says tbot the rear of one who has marched with all his resources without provision for the defence of bis rear is easily seized. A war on this account seems to have been considered a« a remote contingency. Even if it happens, the conqueror is expected to rely upou the aid of hi* enemy, now in alliance with him. >’ee Chapter IX, Book VII. Hence Meyer's emendation is unnecessary and misleading. 331 kautm-y:vs artha&astra When there are two kings, one engaged in destroying a friend and another an enemy, he who attacks the rear of the former gains more advantages; for one who is engaged in destroying an enemy will have the support of his friends and will thereby put down the rear-enemy, hut not the former who is engaged in destroying his ow n side. Wheu the conqueror and his enemy in their attack against the rear of an enemy mean to enforce the payment of what is not due to them, he whose enemy has lost considerable profits and has 303 8USta“iec^ 8 <rreat ruen an(l nioney gains more advantages: when they mean to enforce the payment of what is due to them, then he whose enemy has lost profits and armv, gains more advantages. When the assailable enemy is capable of retaliation and when the assailant's rear-enemy, capable of augmenting his army and other resources, has entrenche 1 himself on one of the assailant's flanks, then the rear-enemy gains more advantages; for a rear enemy cm one of the assailant’s Hanks will not only become a friend of the assuilable enemy, hut also attack the base of the assailant, whereas a rear-enemy behind the assailant can only harass the rear. •Kings capable of harassing the rear of an enemy and of obstruct¬ ing his movements are three : the group of kings situated behind the enemy, and the groups of kings on his two flanks. •He who is situated between a conqueror and his enemy is called an antardlii (one between two kings) ; when such a king is possessed of forts, wild tribes, and other kinds of help, he proves an impediment in the way of the strong. When the conqueror and his enemy are desirous of catching hold of a Madhyauia kiug and attack the latter's rear, then he who in his attempt to enforce the promised payment separates the Mudhyama king from the latter*.* friend, and obtains, thereby, an enemy as a friend, gains more advantages ; for an enemy compelled to sue for peace will be of greater help than a friend compelled to maintain the abandoned friendship. This explaitis the attempt to catch hold -of a natural king. Of attacks from the rear and front, that which affords oppor¬ tunities of carrying on a treacherous fight (mantrayuddha) is preferable. My teacher says that in an open war, both sides suffer by sustaining a heavy loss of men and money; and that even the king 332 KAUTILYA’S ARTHASA8TRA who wins a victory will appear as defeated in consequence of the o*3 of men and money. 20^ *No, says Kautilya, even at considerable loss of men and money, the destruction of an enemy is desirable. Loss of men and money being equal, he who entirely destroys first his frontal enemy, and next attacks his rear-enemy gains more advantages ; when both the conqueror and his enemy are severally engaged in destroying their respective frontal enemies, he who destroys a frontal enemy of deep-rooted enmity and of vast resources, gains more advantages. This explains the destruction of other enemies and wild tribes: ♦When an enemy in the rear and in the front, and an assailable enemy to be marched against happen together, then the conqueror should adopt the following policy : ♦The rear-enerny will usually lead the conqueror’s frontal enemy to attack the conqueror’s friend ; then having set the ukranda (the enemy of the rear-enemy) against the rear-enemy’s ally. ♦And, having caused war between them, the conqueror should frustrate the rear-enemy’s designs ; likewise he should provoke hostilities between the allies of the akranda and of the rear-enemy ; ♦he should also keep his frontal enemy’s friend engaged in war with his own friend ; and with the help of his friend’s friend he should avert the attack, threatened by the friend of his enemy's friend ; ♦he should, with his friend’s help, hold his rear-enemy at bay; and with the help of his friend’s friend he should prevent his rear- enemy attacking the akranda (his rear-ally); ♦thus the conqueror should, through the aid of his friends, bring the Circle of States under his own sway, both in bis rear and front; ♦he should send messengers and spies to reside in each of the 305 8tdte3 comP°3ing the Circle, and having again and again destroyed the strength of his enemies, he should keep his counsels concealed, being friendly with his friends; ♦the works of him whose counsels are not kept concealed will, though they may prosper for a time, perish as undoubtedly as a broken raft on the sea. [Thus ends Chapter XIII, “ Considerations about an Enemy in the Hear,” in Book VII, “ The End of the Six-fold Policy 99 of the Arthasastra of Kautilya. End of the hundred and eleventh chapter from the beginning.] 333 KAU'flLYA’S ARTHASASTRA CHAPTER XIV Recruitment of Lost Power When the conqueror is thus attacked by the combined army of his enemies, he may tell their leader: 44 I shall make peace with you ; this is tLe gold, and I am the friend ; your gain is doubled ; it is not worthy of you to augment at your own expense the power 6f your enemies who keep a friendly appearance now ; for gaining in power, they will put you down in the long run.” Or he may tell the leader, so as to break the combination : 44 Just as an innocent person like myself is now attacked by the combined army of these kings, so the very same kings in combination will attack you in weal or woe; for power intoxicates the mind ; hence break their combination.” The combination bJing broken, he may set the leader against the weak among his enemies ; or, offering inducements, he may set the combined power of the weak against the leader ; or in whatever w’ay he nmy find it to be conducive to his own prosperity, in that way he may make the leader incur the displeasure of others, aud thus frustrate their attempts; or showing the prospect of a larger profit, he may through intrigue make peace with their leader. Then the recipients of salaries from two states, exhibiting the acquisition of large profits (to the leader) may satirise the kings, saying, 44 You are all very well combined.” If some of tiie kings of the combination are wicked, thev may 3Qg be made to break the treaty ; then the recipients of salaries from two states may again tell them, so as to break the com¬ bination entirely: 44 This is just what we have already pointed out.” Wheu the enemies are separated, the conqueror may move forward by catching hold of any of the kings (as an ally). In the absence of a leader, the conqueror may win him over who is the inciter of the combination ; or who is of a resolute mind, or who has endeared himself to his people, or who, from greed or fear, joined the combination, or who is afraid of the couqueror, or whose friendship with the conqueror is based upon some consan¬ guinity of royalty, or who is a friend, or who is a wandering euemy—in the order of enumeration. Of#these, one has to please the inciter by surrendering oneself, by conciliation and salutation : him who is of a resolute mind, by giving a daughter in marriage or by availing oneself of his youtfi 35# KAUflbYA4! jUtTKAtiARTHl (tit beget n flou on one's wifejfj; him who id the be luvcd of Eii3 pciopla, bj giving twice tbo nntouutOf profit*; him who ifl greedy, Lv helping with men an 1 money; him who i* afraid of tkv ouni- biiicuionr by giving n ho^U^e to- him wlm i* naturally timid ; by entering itim n clmir union wlih hi in whose friendship k based upon ^liiu q^nmogniTilty of royalty ; by doin^ what ia pleading an I buns tic ii! to both or by abiiiitfiomng hostilities Against him whi is a fripn I; .ml by offering help aul i bin do rung buiH.il itk* against hi.ni who is ii wandering enemy ; ™ie h.u to win over th*? coin i.iJi'iii i' of Any of fcUe abgiva kiagn by adopting suitable m«?:uk - or by tscuu yf oontfiiiutlwb gift** dtsMuaion, or threats, as will be exphurif* I under +l TroubW’ E[u whi* Li in rr«-Mjbb.M- and is apprehensive of an attuek from Id* itiiumy shmiH, on tbs condition uf i#upp|yiug tbo e!b<*my with army ami money, tonka pence with the an array on definite berms with reference to place, time, ami work ; he should iitso net. right any offence he nnpht Hava given by th* viol .it ion of a treaty ^ it he has no supporters, he should find theninmong hie fidAti ves and friends F i*r hr- may hnild an impr^piiblo fortress, for he who is defended hy forts and friends will be respected both by his own and bis enemy's people.

My teacher says that one may rush against the enemy like a moth against a llame ; success in one way or other U.e. death or victory) is certain for one who is reckless of life. No, says Kautiiya, having observed the conditions conducive to peace between himself and his enemy, he may make peace ; in the absence of such conditions, be may, by taking recourse to threats, secure peace or a friend ; or he may send a messenger to one who is likely to accept peace ; or having pleased with wealth and honour the messenger sent by his enemy, he may tell the latter : “This is the king’s manufactory; this is the residence of the queen and the prince; myself and this kingdom are at your disposal, as approved of by the queen and the princes/’ Having secured his enemy’s protection, he should behave him¬ self like a servant to his master by serving the protector’s occasional needs. Forts and other defensive works, acquisition of things, celebration of marriages, installation of the heir-apparent, trade in horses, capture of elephants? construction of covert places for battle Uattra), marching against an enemy, and holding sports—all these he should undertake only at the permission of his protector. He should also obtain his protector’s permission before making any agreement with people settled in his country or before punishing those who may run away from country. If the citizens and country people living in his kingdom prove disloyal or inimical to him, be may request of his protector another good country ; or he may get rid of wicked people by making use of such secret means as are employed against traitors. He should not accept the offer of a good country even from a friend. Unknown to his protector, he may see 22 338 KAUTILYA'S akthasastra the protector’s minister, high priest, commander of the army or heir-apparent. He should also help his protector as much as he can- On all occasions of worshipping gods and making prayers, he should cause his people to pray for the long life of his protector ; and he should always proclaim his reudiness to place himself at the disposal of his protector. •Serving him who is strong and combined with others, And being far away from the society of suspected persons, a conquered king should thus always behave himself towards his protector.

End of the hundred and thirteenth chapter from the beginning.] CHAPTER XVI The Attitude of a Conquered King In view of causing financial trouble to his protector, a powerful vassal king, desirous of making conquests, may, under the permission of his protector, march on countries where the formation of the ground and the climate are favourable for the manoeuvre of bis army, his enemy having neither forts nor any other defensive works, and the conqueror himself having no enemies in the rear. Otherwise (in case of enemies in the rear), he should march after baking provisions for the defence of his rear. By means of conciliation and gifts, he should subdue weak kings; and by means of sowing the seeds of dissension and by threats, strong kings. By adopting a particular,# or an alternative, or all of the strategic means, he should subdue his immediate and distant enemies. He should observe the policy of conciliation by promising the protection of villages, of those who live in forests, of flocks of cattle, and of the roads of traffic, as well as the restoration of those who have been banished or who have run away or who have done some harm. Gifts of land, of things, and of girls in marriage, and absence of fear—by declaring these, he should observe the policy of gifts. By instigating any one of a neighbouring king, a wild chief, a CAUl-im'S AKmAikStb* 339 ■cion of Vlic enemy a family, or an imprisoned prince, lie should bow the seed* of dittsgftdon, By capturing the enemy iii an open brittle, or in a treacherous light, or through a conspiracy. or m the tumult of seising the enemy** fort by strategic HJ-^nUNv In* should punish the enemy.

If he happens to have an enemy in the r*arfr or a wild chiof, or an tmcmyr or a chief enemy capable of being propitiated with the gift of lands, he should provide atirh n.n enemy with a useless piece of land; nu enemy puMSv^bfpd of forln with a piece of land not Con¬ ner ted with his fconquerors) own territory ; a wild chief with a piece of land yielding no livelihood ; a scion of the enemy1# family with n piece nf land that nun be taken back : an enemy's prisoner with a pierce of land which is (Hot ?) *notchmd from the enemy ; a corporation of uriunri men with a piece of land constantly under [rouble* from an enemy : the combination cf corporation* with a piece of land close to the territory of a powerful king ; a corporation invincible in war with w piece of Sand under both the above trouble* ; a spirited king drairoua of war with u piece of land which affords no at! vamag^ous positions for the manof>uvro of the army ; an enemy1! partisan with waste land#; a bstmhcd prince w ith a piece of land exhausted of its resource! ; a king who hu? ran*twcd the nbservaiacc 340 KAUTILYA’S AKTHASASTRA of a treaty of peace after breaking it, with a piece of land which can be colonized at considerable cost of men and money ; a deserted prince with a piece of laud which affords no protection ; and his own protector with an uninhabitable piece of land. (The king who is desirous of making conquests) should continue in following the same policy towards him, who, among the above kings, is most helpful and keeps the same attitude; should by secret means bring him round who is opposed ; should favour the helpful with facilities for giving further help, besides bestowing rewards and honour at all costs upon him ; should give relief to him who is under troubles ; should receive visitors at their own choice and afford satisfaction to them ; should avoid using contemptuous, threatening, defamatory, or harsh words towards them ; should like a father protect those who are promised security from fear; should punish the guilty after publishing their guilt; and in order to avoid causing suspicion to the protector, the vassal king should adopt the procedure of inflicting secret punishments upon offenders. He should never covet the land, things, and sons and wives of the king slain by him ; he should reinstate in their own estates the relatives of the kings slain. He should install in/the king¬ dom the heir-apparent of the king who has died while work¬ ing (with the conqueror); all conquered kings will, if thus^treated^ loyally follow the sons and grandsons of the conqueror. Whoever covets the lands, things, sous, and wives of the kings whom he has either slain or bound in chains will cause provocation to the Circle of States and make it rise against himself; also bis own ministers employed in his own territory will be provoked, and will seek shelter under the Circle of States, having an eye upon his life and kingdom. ♦Hence conquered kings preserved in their own lands in accord' aoce with the policy of conciliation will be loyal to the conqueror and follow his sons and grandsons, [Thus ends Chapter XVI, “ The Attitude of a Conquered King/’ in Book VII, “ The End of the Six-fold Policy ” of the Arthasastra of Kautilya. End of the hundred and fourteenth chapter from the beginning.] 341 KAUJILYA'S AHTHASASTHA CHAPTER XVII Making Peace and Breaking It The words Kama (quiet), sandhi (agreement of peace), and samadhi (reconcilement), are synonymous. That which is conducive to mutual faith among kings is termed Kama, sandhi, or fumadbi. My teacher says that peace, dependent upon honesty or oath, is mutable, while peace with a security or a hostage is immutable. No, says Kautilya, peace, dependent upon honesty or oath, is immutable both in this and the next world. If is for this world only that a security or a hostage is required for strengthening the agreement. Honest kings of old made their agreement of peace with this declaration : “ We have joined in peace.” In case of any apprehen- 2 ^ sion of breach of honesty, they made their agreement by swearing by fire, water, plough, the brick of a fort wall, the shoulder of an elephant, the hips of a horse, the front of a chariot, a weapon, seeds, scents, juice (rasa), wrought gold (suvarna), or bullion gold (hirai?ya), and by declaring that these things will destroy and desert him who violates the oath. In order to avoid the contingency of violation of oath, peace made with the security of such persons as ascetics engaged in penance, or nobles, is peace with a security. In such a peace, w hoever takes as security a person capable of controlling the enemy gains more advantages, while he who acts to the contrary is deceived. In peace made with children as hostages, and in the case of giving a princess or a prince as a hostage, whoever gives a princess gains advantages; for a princess, when taken as a hostage, causes troubles to the receiver, while a prince is of reverse nature. With regard to two sons, whoever hands over a high-born, brave and wise son, trained in military art, or an only son, is deceived* while he who acts otherwise gains advantages. It is better to give a base-born son as a hostage than a high-born one, inasmuch as the former has neither heirship nor the right to beget heirs; it is betteT to give a stupid son than a wise one, inasmuch as the former is destitute of the power of deliberation ; better to give a timid son than a brave one, inasmuch as the former is destitute of martial spirit; better a son who is not trained in military art than one who is trained, inasmuch as the former is devoid of the capacity for 22* 342 KAUTILYA’S ARTHASASTRA striking an enemy ; and better one of many sons than an only son since many sons are not wanted. With regard to a high-born and wise son, people will continue to be loyal to a high-born son though he is not wise ; a wise son, though base-born, is characterised with capacity to consider state matters ; but so far as capacity to consider state matters is con¬ cerned, a high-born prince associating himself with the aged, has more advantages than a wise but base-born prince. With regard to a wise and a brave prince, a wise prince, though - timid, is characterised with capacity for intellectual works; and a brave prince, though not wise, possesses warlike spirit. So far as warlike spirit is concerned, a wise prince over-reaches a brave one just as a hunter does an elephant. With regard to a brave and a trained prince, a brave prince, though untrained, is characterised with capacity for war; and a trained prince, though timid, is capable of hitting objects aright- Notwithstanding the capacity for hitting objects aright, a brave prince excels a trained prince in determination and firm adherence to bis policy. With regard to a king having many sons and another an only son, the former, giving one of his sons as a hostage and being contented with the rest, is able to break the peace; but not the latter. When peace is made by handing over the whole lot of sons, advantage is to be sought in capacity to beget additional sons; capacity to beget additional sons being common, he who can beget able sons will have more advantages than another king (who is not so fortunate); capacity to beget able sons being common, he by whom the birth of a son is early expected will have more advantages than another (who is not so fortunate). In the case of an only son who is also brave,.he who has lost capacity to beget any more sons should surrender himself as a hostage, but not the only son. Whoever is rising in power may break the agreement of peace. Carpenters, artisans, and other spies, attending upon the prince (kept as a hostage) and doing work under the enemy, may take away the prince at night through an underground tunnel dug for the purpose. Dancers, actors, singers, players on musical instruments* buffoons, court-bards, swimmers, and eaubhikas (?), previously set about the enemy, may continue under his service and may indirectly 343 KAUTJLVA’S arthasastba serve the prince. They should have the privilege of entering into, stay ing in and going out of, the palace at any time without rule. The prince may therefore get out at night disguised as any one of the above spies. This explains the work of prostitutes and other women spies jjg under the garb of wives; the prince may get out, carrying their pipes, utensils, or vessels. Or the prince may he removed concealed under things, clothes, commodities, vessels, beds, seats and other articles, by cooks, confectioners, servants employed to serve the king while bathing, servants employed for carrying conveyances, for spreading the bed, toilet-making, dressing, and procuring water; or taking something in pitch dark, he may get out, disguised as a servant. Or lie may (pretend to) be in communion with god Yanina in a reservoir (which is seen) through a tunnel, or to which he is taken at night; spies under the guise of traders dealing in cooked rice and fruits may (poison those things and) distribute among the sentinels. Or having served the sentinels with cooked rice and beverage mixed with the juice of mad ana plant on occasions of making offerings to gods or of performing an ancestral ceremony or some sacrificial rite, the prince may get out ; or by bribing the sentinels ; or spies disguised as a nagaraka (officer in charge of the city), a court-bard, or a physician may set fire to a building filled with valuable articles; or sentinels, or spies disguised an merchants, may set fire to the store of commercial articles ; or in view of avoiding the fear of pursuit, the prince may, after putting some human body in the house occupied by him, set fire to it and escape by breaking open some house-joints, or a window, or through a tunnel; or having disguised himself as a carrier of glass beads, pots, and other com¬ modities he may set out at night; or having entered the residence of ascetics with shaven heads or with twisted hair, he may set out at night, disguised as any one of them ; or having disguised himself as one suffering from a peculiar disease or as a forest man, he may get out ; or spies may carry him away as a corpse; or, disguised as a widowed wife, he may follow a corpse that is being carried away. Spies, disguised as forest people, should mislead the pursuers of the prince by pointing out another direction, and the prince himself may take a different direction. Or he may escape, hiding himself in the midst of carts or cart 344 KAtffOiYA+S AUTHMifcTBA driver ; if he is rlnarly followed, lie may lead tlio piiMifr- 317 tn un ambuaoad* (sattra); iu the ub^nce of m ambiucnde he rajly leave here and 1.litre gold or mursfito of fiaicontd food on both fndfl* of a road ud take a different- toad.

The conduct of the Madhyama king explains that of the neutral king. If the neutral king is desirous of combining with the Madhyama king, then the conqueror should so attempt as to frustrate the desire of the neutral king to over-reach an enemy or to help a friend or to secure the services of the army of another neutral king. Having thus strengthened himself, the conqueror should reduce his enemies and help his friends, though their position is inimical towards him. Those who may be inimical to the conqueror are, a king who is of wicked character and who is therefore always harmful, a rear-enemy in combination with a frontal enemy, a reducible enemy under troubles, and one who is watching the troubles of the oonqueror to invade him. Those who may be friendly with the conqueror are, one who marches with him with the same end in view, one who marches with him with a different end in view’, one who wants to combine with the conqueror to march (against a common enemy), one who marches under an agreement for peace, one who marches with a set purpose of his own, one who rises along with others, one who is ready to purchase or to sell either the army or the treasury, and one who adopts the double policy (i.e. making peace with one and waging war with another). Those neighbouring kings who can be servants to the conqueror are, a neighbouring king under the apprehension of an attack from a powerful king, one who is situated between the conqueror and his enemy, the rear-enemy of a powerful king, one who has voluntarily surrendered oneself to the conqueror, one who has surrendered oneself under fear, and one who has been subdued. The same is the case with those kings who are next to the territory of the immediate enemies of the conqueror. ♦Of these kings, the conqueror should, as far as possible, help that friend who has the same end in view as the conqueror in his conflict with the enemy, and thus hold the enemy at bay. ♦When, after having put down the enemy, and after having grown in power, a friend becomes unsubmissive, the conqueror should cause the friend to incur the displeasure of a neighbour and of the king who is next to the neighbour. 347 KAUTILYA'S ARTHAS.lSTRA ♦Or the conqueror may employ a scion of the friend's family or an imprisoned prince to seize his lands j or the conqueror 320 ma^ 80 aCt friend, desirous of further help, may continue to be obedient, ♦The conqueror should never help his friend when the latter is more and more deteriorating ; a politician should m keep his friend that the latter neither deteriorates nor grows in power. ♦When, with the desire of getting wealth, a wandering friend (t e. a nomadic king) makes an agreement with the conqueror, the latter should so remove the cause of the friend's flight that he never flies again. ♦When a friend is as accessible to the conqueror as to the latter’s enemy, the conqueror should first separate that obstinate friend from the enemy, and then destroy him, and afterwards the enemy also, ♦When a friend remains neutral, the conqueror should cause him to incur the displeasure of his immediate enemies; and when he is worried in his wars with them, the conqueror should oblige him with help, ♦When, owing to his own weakness, a friend seeks protection both from the conqueror and the latter’s enemy, the conqueror should help him with the army, so that he never turns his attention elsewhere. ♦Or having removed him from his own lands, the conqueror may keep him in another tract of land, having made some previous arrangements to punish or favour the friend. ♦Or the conqueror may harm him when he has grown power¬ ful, or destroy him when he does not help the conqueror in danger and when he lies on the conqueror's lap in good faith. ♦When an enemy furiously rises against his own enemy (t.c. the conqueror's friend) under troubles, the former should be put down by the latter himself with troubles concealed, ♦When a friend keeps quiet after rising against an enemy under troubles, that friend will be subdued by the enemy himself after getting rid of his troubles. ♦Whoever is acquainted with the sense of polity should clearly 221 observe the conditions of progress, deterioration, stagnation, reduction, and destruction, as well as the use of all kinds of strategic means. ♦Whoever thus knows the interdependence of the six kinds of g-lfl KAU7«<VA‘S artiiaMbtka (jolicy play* nt his pleasure with kiiijj#, bound round, us it wew, in chains skilfully devised by biinst-if.

Vidfilitksba says that of the troubles of the minister and of the people, the troubles of the people are more serious : finance, army, raw products, free labour, carriage of things, and collection (of necessaries) are all secured from the people. There will be no such things in the absence of people, next to the king and his minister. No, says Kautilva, all activities proceed from the minister: activities such as the successful accomplishment of the works of the 323 f>eof^e' 8ecurity person and property from internal and external enemies, remedial measures against calamities, colonization and improvement of wild tracts of land, recruiting the army, collection of revenue, and bestowal of favour. The school of Parasara say that of the distress of the people and distress due to bad fortifications, the latter is a more serious evil; for it is in fortified towns that the treasury and the army are secured ; they (fortified towns) are a secure place for the people; they are a stronger power than the citizens or country people ; and they area powerful defensive instrument in times of danger for the king. As to the people, they are common both to the king and his enemy. No, says Kautilva, for forts, finance, and the army depend upon the people; likewise buildings, trade, agriculture, cattle-rearing, bravery, stability, power, and abundance (of things). In all countries people do not generally reside on fortified mountains and islands owing to the ubsence of an expansive country. When a country consists purely of cultivators, troubles due to the absence of forti¬ fications (are apparent); while in a country which consists purely of warlike people, troubles that may appear are due to the absence of (an expansive and cultivated) territory. 1’isunu says that of the troubles due to the absence of forts and KAUTILYA’S ARTH AS ASTRA 351 to want of finance, troubles due to want of finance are more serious ; the repair of fortifications and their maintenance depend upon finance ; by means of wealth, intrigue to capture an enemy's fort may be carried cm ; by means of wealth, the people, friends, and enemies can be kept under control; by means of it, outsiders can he encour¬ aged and the establishment of the army and its operations conducted. It is possible to remove the treasures in times of danger, but not the fort, No, says Kautitya, for it is in the fort that the treasury and the army are safely kept, and it is from the fort that secret war (intrigue) control over one’s partisans, the upkeep of the army, the reception of allies and the driving out of enemies and of wild tribes nre successfully practised. In the absence of forts, the treasury is to the enemy, for it seems that for those who own forts there is no destruction* Kaunapadauta says that of distress due to want of finance or to an inefficient army, that which is due to the want of an efficient army is more serious; for control over one's own friends and enemies, the winning over the army of an enemy, and the business of administration are all dependent upon the army. In the absence of the army, it is certain that the treasury will he lost, whereas lack of finance can be made up by procuring raw- products and lands, or by seizing an enemy’s territory the army cart be strengthened* With the army finance is secured. The army being ever at hand, it can exercise the functions of a minister. No, says Kantilya, the army is dependent upon finance* In the " absence of finance the army may go to the enemy, or murder the king himself, and bring about ail kinds of troubles* But finance is the chief means of observing virtuous acts and of enjoying desires. Owing to a change in place, time, and policy, either finance or the army may be a superior power; for the army is (sometimes) the means of securing the wealth acquired ; but wealth is (always) the means of securing both the treasury and the army* *Siuce all activi¬ ties are dependent upon finance, financial troubles are more serious, Yatavyadki says that of the distress of the army and of an ally, the distress of an ally is more serious—an ally, though he is not fed and is far off, is still serviceable ; he drives off not only the rear- enemy and the friends of the rear-enemy, but also the frontal enemy aud wild tribes ; he also helps his friend with money, army, and lands on occasions of troubles. 352 KAUTILYA*S ARTHASASTBA No, nays Kautilya, the ally of him who has a powerful army keeps the alliance; and even the,enemy assumes a friendly attitude ; when there is a work that can be equally accomplished either by the army or by an ally, then preference to the army or to the ally should depend on the advantages of securing the appropriate place and time for war and the expected profit* In times of sudden expedition and on occasions of troubles from an enemy, a wild tribe* or local rebels, no friend can be trusted. When calamities happen together, or when an enemy has grown strong, a friend keeps up his friendship as long as money is forthcoming. Thus the determina¬ tion of the comparative seriousness of the calamities of the various elements of sovereignty. •When a part of one of the elements of sovereignty is under troubles, the extent, affection, and strength of the serviceable part can be the means of accomplishing a work. •When any two elements of sovereignty are equally under troubles, they should be distinguished in respect of their progressive or declining tendency, provided that the good condition of the rest of the dements needs no description* •When the calamities of a single element tend to destroy 22g the rest of the elements, those calamities, whether they be of the fundamental or any other element, are verily serious. [Thus ends Chapter I, “ The Aggregate of the Calamities of the Elements of Sovereignty/* in Book VIII, “ Concerning Vices and * Calamities ** of the ArthaAastra of Kautilya. End of the hundred and seventeenth chapter from the beginning.] CHAPTER II Considerations about the Troubles of the King and of His Kingdom The king and his kingdom are the primary elements of the state. The troubles of the king may be either internal or external. Internal troubles are more serious than external troubles, which are like the danger arising from a lurking snake. Troubles due to a minister are more serious than other kinds of internal troubles. Hence, the king should keep under his own control the powers of finance and the army. 363 KAUTILYA'S ARTHA3ASTUA Of divided rule and foreign rule, divided rule, or rule of a country by two kings, perishes owing to mutual hatred, partiality and rivalry. My teacher says that foreign rule whjoh depends upon its wiuning the affection of the people is for the enjoyment of others ip its own condition. No, says Kautilya : divided rule Letweeu father and son or between two brothers has similar consequences and is under the clutches of a minister. But foreign rule brought into existence by seizing the country from its king still alive thinks that the country is not its own, impoverishes it and carries off its w ealth, or treats it as a commercial article ; and when the country cease** to love it, it retires, abandoning the country. , Which is better, a blind king, or a king erring against the science ? My teacher says that a blind king, i.e- a king who is not possessed of an eye in sciences, is indiscriminate in doiug works, very obstinate, and is led by others ; such a king destroys the kingdom by his own maladministration. But an erring king can be easily brought round when and where his mind goes astray from the pro¬ cedure laid dowu in sciences. No, says Kautilya, a blind king can be made by his supporters to adhere to whatever liue of policy he ought to. But an erring king, who is bent upon doing what is against the science, brings about destruction to himself and his kingdom by mal¬ administration. Which is better, a diseased or a new king ? My teacher says that a diseased king loses bis kingdom owing to the intrigue of his ministers, or loses his life on account of the king¬ dom ; but a new king pleases the people by such popular deeds as the observance of his own duties and the act of bestowing favours, remissious (of taxes), gifts, and presents upon others. No, says Kautilya, a diseased king continues to observe his duties as usual. But a new king begins to act as he pleases, under the impression that the country, acquired by his own might,.belongs to himself; when pressed by combined kings (for plunder), he tolerates their oppression of the country. Or having no firm control over the elements of the state, he is easily removed. There k* this difference amoug diseased kings : a king who is morally diseased, and a king who is suffering from physical disease ; there is also this difference among new kings : a high-born king and a base-born.king. 23 351 KAUTtt.YVS ABTHAaiSTRA Which is better, s weak but high-bont king, or ft atrons but Iftw- born king i My teacher ssys that it people, even if interested in having weak kinu, hardly allow roont for the intrigues of it weak but high-born pcr*un to be their king:; but tbal if they desire power, they will easily yield thenim-lves lu the intrigues uf ft strong but base-born ponon to be tbfir king.

Ilia the foundation of bravery ; it pul* nil end to despicable {persona) ; and it keep the people under fear, Anger is always a 355 KAUTILYA’S ARTHASASTRA necessary quality for the prevention of sin. But desire (accompanies) the enjoyment of results, reconciliation, generosity, and the act of endearing oneself to all. Possession of desire is always necessary for him who is inclined to enjoy the fruits of what he has accom¬ plished. No, says Kaufcilya, anger brings about enmity with, and troublea from, an enemy, and is always associated with pain. Addiction to pleasure (kama) occasions contempt and loss of wealth, and throws the addicted person into the company of thieves, gamblers, hunters, singers, players on musical instruments, and other undesii- able persons. Of these, enmity is more serious than contempt, for a despised person is caught hold of by his own people and by his enemies, whereas a hated person is destroyed. Troublea from an enemy are more serious than loss of wealth, for loss of wealth causes financial troubles, whereas troubles from an enemy are injurious to life. Suffering on account of vices is more serious than keeping company with undesirable persons, for the company of undesirable persons can be got rid of in a moment, whereas suffering from vices causes injury for a long time. Hence, anger is a more serious evil. Which is worse : abuse of language, or of money, or oppressive punishment ? Visalaksha says that, of abuse of language and of money, abuse of language is worse ; for when harshly spoken to, a brave man retaliates ; and bad language, like a nail piercing the heart, excites anger and gives pain to the senses. No, says Kautilya, gift of money palliates the fury occasioned by abusive language, whereas abuse of money causes the loss of livelihood itself. Abuse of money means gifts, exaction, loss or abandonment of money. The 'school of Parasara say, that, of abuse of money and oppressive punishment, abuse of money is worse ; for good deeds and enjoyments depend upon wealth ; the world itself is bound by wealth. Hence, its abuse is a more serious evil. No, says Kaufcilya, in preference to a large amount of wealth no man desires the loss of his own life. Owing to oppressive punish¬ ment, one is liable to the same punishment at the hands of one s enemies. Such is the nature of the triad of evils due to anger. The fourfold vices due to desire are hunting, gambling, women and drinking.

Both the above consequences follow’ from drinking. The inauspicious effects of drinking are loss of money, lunacy in a sensate man, corpse-like appearance while living, naked¬ ness, the loss of the knowledge of the Vedas, lass of life, wealth, and friends, disassociation with the good, suffering from pain, and indulgence in playing on musical instruments and in singing at the expense of wealth. Of gambling and drinking, gambling causes gain or loss of the stakes to one party or other. Even among dumb auiftals it splits them into factions and causes provocation. It is specially due to gambling that assemblies and royal confederacies possessing the characteristics of assemblies are split iuto factions, and are conse¬ quently destroyed. The reception of what is condemned is the worst of all evils, since it causes incapacity to deal with politics. *The reception of what is condemned is (due to) desire ; and anger consists in oppressing the good ; since both these are produc¬ tive of many evils, both of them are held to be the worst evils* *Hence he who is possessed of discretion should associate with the aged, and, after controlling his passions, abaodou both auger and desire, which are productive of other evils aud destructive of the very basis (of life).

No, says Kautilya. the superintendent of the boundary increases commercial traffic by welcoming the arrival of merchandise, whereas traders unite in causing rise and fall in the value of articles, and live by making profits cent per cent in pahas or kumbhas (measures of grain). 334 Which is more desirable, land occupied by a high-born person or land reserved for grazing a flock of cattle ? My teacher &ays, that the land occupied by a high-born person is very productive ; and it supplies men to the army ; hence it docs uot deserve to be confiscated lest the owner might cause troubles, whereas the land occupied for grazing a flock of cattle is cultivable and deserves therefore to be freed, for cultivable land is preferred to pasture land. No, says Kautilya, though immensely useful, the land occupied by a high born person deserves to be freed, lest he might cause troubles (otherwise), whereas the land held for grazing a flock of cattle is productive of money and beasts, and does not therefore deserve to be confiscated unless cultivation of crops is impeded thereby. My teacher sats, that of robbers and wild tribes, robbers are ever bent on carrying off women at night, make assaults on persons, and take away hundreds and thousands of panas, whereas wild tribes, living under a leader and moving in the neighbouring forests, can be seen here and there causing destruction only to a part. No, says Kautilya, robbers carry off the property of the careless, and cau be put down as they are easily recognized and caught hold of, whereas wild tribes have their own strongholds, being numerous and brave, ready to fight in broad daylight, and seizing and destroy¬ ing countries like kings. Of the forests of beasts and of elephants, beasts are numerous and productive of plenty of flesh and skins; they arrest the growth of the grass and are easly controlled, whereas elephauts are of the reverse nature and are seen to be destructive of countries even when they are captured and tamed. Of benefits derived from one’s own or a foreign country, benefits derived from one’s own country consist of grains, cattle, gold, and raw products, aud are useful for the maintenance of the people in KAUTILYA’S ARTHASASTRA 361 calamities, whereas benefits derived from a foreign country are of the reverse nature. Such is the group of molestations. Obstruction to movements caused by a chief is internal obstruc- 335 ^°n ’ an<^ obstruction t10 movements caused by an enemy or a wild tribe is external obstruction. Such is the group of obstructions. Financial troubles due to the two kinds of obstruction and to the molestations described above are stagnation of financial position, loss of wealth due to the allowance of remission of taxes in favour of leaders, scattered revenue, false account of revenue collected, and revenue left in the custody of a neighbouring kiug or of a wild tribe. Thus the group of financial troubles. *In the interests of the prosperity of the country, one should attempt to avoid the cause of troubles, remedy then! when they happen, and avert obstructions and financial troubles.

My teacher says that of enthusiasm and power, enthusiasm is better: a king, himself energetic, brave, strong, free from disease, skilful in wielding weapons, is able with his army as a secondary power to subdue a powerful king ; his army, though small, will, when led by him. be capable of turning out any work. But a king who has no enthusiasm in himself will perish, though he is powerful and possessed of a strong army. No, says Kautilya, he who is possessed of power over-reaches, by the sheer force of his power, another who is merely enthusiastic. Having acquired, captured, or brought another enthusiastic king as well as brave soldiers, he can make his enthusiastic army of horses, elephants, chariots, and others to move anywhere without obstruc¬ tion. Powerful kings, whether women, young men, lame, or blind, conquered the earth by winning over or purchasing the aid of enthusiastic persons. My teacher says that of power (money and army) and skill in intrigue, power is better; for a king, though possessed of skill for intrigue (mantrasakti) becomes a man of barren mind if he has no power; for the work of intrigue is well defined. He who has no power loses his kingdom as sprouts of seeds in drought vomit their sap. No, sAys Kautilya, skill for intrigue is better ; he who has the eye of knowledge, and is acquainted with the science of polity, can, Mti K A HT ILYA'S with ]tittle mlfnrt, make uws of hi* ^kill for iflATigije, rtn^ rAT* hu■:ucm 1 by means nf rttiiriiiatiun, ntid otK^r AtrAtagi? mean ft And by ipie# and dieiuicul undiaucv* hi &veM$acbipg *ven tlmao kiisgB who arc possessed of nntliiii asm and power Sbu^ of the three* acquirements, n'r, enlbusiiwuii pft«er ami akiil for intrigue, btf w bo pumsesseft more of thr quality mrubiumrd later than the owe m^nti-nn Ail fir^t in the order of uiltU^ortUii1 ti will be ittcfl’Wifitl in over-rcsen- iag others Country {jjucf] ineAArt the earth in it the thcin^nd yujwrnia ni the northern portion of th” country that utrctchoe between the Himalayas and the nc^an from the dominion of no iisidgnihoani eTupnror; ink there tiro such v^rietie* of lutid, ns forests, vdJu(leaP WL'mntLin^ level plains, and uneven grounds* In such lands, lie should undertake such work «4 be wmwdera to be conducive to hi* power and pruspority.

Hence, against a country containing plenty of water and during the rainy season, one should march with an army mostly composed of elephants. Against a country of the reverse description, i.e. which has little rain and muddy water, one should march with an array mostly composed of asses, camels, and horses. Against a desert, one should march during the rainy season with all the four constituents of the army (elephants, horses, chariots and men). One should prepare a programme of short and long distances to be marched in accrodance with the nature of the ground to be traversed, viz. even ground, uneven ground, valleys and plains. •When the work to be accomplished is small, march against all kinds of enemies should be of a short duration ; and when it i> ireat, it should also be of long duration ; during the rains, encamp¬ ment should be made abroad.

CHAPTER II The Time of Recruiting the Army ; the Form ok % Equipment; and the Work of Arraying a Rival Force The time of recruiting troops, such as hereditary troops (maula), hired troops, corporation of soldiers (srenl), troops belonging to a friend or to an enemy, and wild tribes. When he (a king) thinks that his hereditary army is more than he requires for the defence of his own possessions, or when he thinks that as his hereditary army consists of more men then he requires some of them may be disaffected ; or when he thiuks that his enemy has a strong hereditary army famous for its attachment, and is, therefore, to be fought out with much skill on S43 Part : or w*ien be thinks that, though the roads are good nud the weather favourable, it is still the hereditary army that can endure wear and tear ; or when he thinks that, though the) 371 K Al*TI LrA^S A kTH I km It A *xe fniuoim for their attachment, hired soldier* i,m! otkr kind* of troops fiinnot be relied upon leat they plight lend their enffl to tdm ilLtrij(M*i of the enemy to b* mvudud ; or when hr tlduki that other kiiidri of force ore wanting in strength, then is the titnn for taking the hereditary army, htsii he thinks lli-fit the army lie ha* hired is grciilrr than hi** hereditary army ; that hie enemy's hereditary anny U *rn>dl and dttuJluctad, while the mmy hte enemy has hired j ip igiiiftatnt and wt,-ik ; tliat m-tmil light is lean than trench'-roiii rt^ht; that M l. <- - I ir,« r° 1 traversed ami the time required do not entail much June : Uia? hi* own army ie little given to stupor, i« beyond th* fear of intrigue, ■md is reliable ■ or that Iitik is the emmy's power which l U . : r put dfiwij+ then is the time for leading the hired army.

This explains the time for the engagement of wild tribes. When he thinks that the army of wild tribes is living by the same road (that his enemy has to traverse) ; that the road is unfavourable for the march of his enemy’s army ; that his enemy’s army consist mostly of wild tribes ; that just as a wood-apple (bilva) is broken by means of another wood-apple, the small armv of his enemy is to be destroyed, then is the time for engaging the army of wild tribes. lhat army which is vast and is composed of various kinds of men and is so enthusiastic as to rise even without provision and wages for plunder when told or untold ; that which is capable of applying its own remedies against unfavourable rains ; that which can be disbanded and which is invincible for enemies; and that of which all the men are of the same .country, same caste, and sftnc training, is (to be considered as) a compact body of vast power. Such are the periods of time for recruiting the armv. Of these armies, one has to pay the army of wild tribes either with raw produce or with allowance for plunder. W heu the time for the march of one's enemy’s army has approach¬ ed, one has to obstruct the enemy or send him far away, or make his movements fruitless, or, by false promise, cause him to delay the march, and then deceive him after the tune for his march has passed away. One should ever be vigilant to increase one’s own resources and frustrate the attempts of one's enemy to gain in strength. Of these armies, that which is mentioned first is better than the one subsequently mentioned in the order of enumeration. Hereditary army is better than hired army, inasmuch as the former has its existence dependent on that of its master, and is constantly drilled. 1 hat kind of hired army which is ever near, ready to rise quickly, and obedient, is better than a corporation of soldiers. That corpora- 345 **on soldiers which is native, which has the same end in view (as the king), and which is actuated with similar feelings of rivalry, anger, and expectation of success and gain, is better than the army of a friend. Even that corporation of soldiers which is further removed in place and time is, in virtue of its having the same end in view, better than the army of a friend.

Knd of the hundred and twenty-fifth chapter from the beginning.] CHAPTER V External and Internal Dangers The formation of a treaty and other settlements otherwise than 352 t*leJr 0Ug*H 10 been made is impolicy. From it arise dangers. The various kinds of dangers are : that which is of external origin and of internal abetment; that which is of iuternal origin and of external abetment; that which is of external origin and of external abetment; and that which is of internal origin and of internal abetment. Where foreigners carry on an intrigue with local men or local men with foreigners, there the consequence of the intrigue carried on by the combination of local and foreign persons will be very serious. Abettors of an intrigue have a better chance of success ' than its originators; for when the originators of an intrigue are put down, others will hardly succeed in undertaking any other intrigue. Foreigners can hardly win over local persons by intrigue ;'nor can local men seduce foreigners. Foreigners will fiud their vast efforts after all unavailing, and only conducive to the prosperity of the king (against whom they want to conspire). When local persons are abetting (with foreigners), the means to be employed to suppress them are conciliation (s.inia) and gifts (dana). r The act of pleasing a man with a high rank and honour is conciliation ; favour and remission of taxes or employment to couduct state works is what is termed gifts. W hen foreigners are abetting, the king should employ the policy of dissension and coercion. Spies under the guise of friends mav 380 KAUTILYA’S AUTHASASTRA inform foreigners : “ Mind, this man is desirous of deceiving you with the help of his own spies, who are disguised as traitors.” Spies under the garb of traitors may mix with traitors and separate them from foreigners, or foreigners from local traitors. Fiery spies may make friendship with traitors and kill them with weapons or poison ; or having invited the plotting foreigners, they may murder the latter. Where foreigners carry on an intrigue with foreigners, or local men with local men, there the consequences of the intrigue, unani- jgj mously carried on with a set purpose, will be very serious. When guilt is got rid of, there will be no guilty persons; but when a guilty person is got rid of, the guilt will contaminate others. Hence, when foreigners carry on an intrigue, the king should employ the policy of dissension and coercion. Spies under the guise of friends may inform foreign conspirators : “ Mind, this your king, with the desire of enriching himself, is naturally provoked against you all.” Then fiery spies may mix with the servants and soldiers of the abettor (of foreign conspirators) and kill them with weapons, poison, and other means. Other spies may then expose or betray the abettor. W hen local men carry on an intrigue with local men, the king should employ necessary strategic means to put it down. He may employ the policy of conciliation with regard to those who keep the appearance of contentment, or who are naturally discontented or otherwise. Gifts may be given under the pretext of having been satisfied with a favoured man’s steadfastness in maintaining the purity of his character, or under the plea of anxious care about his weal or woe. A spy under the garb of a friend may tell the local persons: ” Your king is attempting to find your heart; you should tell him the truth.” Or local men may be separated from each other, by telling them : “ This man carries such a tale to the king against you.” And coercive measure may be employed as described in the chapter on 44 Awards of Punishments.”1 Of these four kinds of danger, internal danger should first be got rid of; for it has been already stated that internal troubles, like the fear from a lurking snake, are more serious than external troubles. *One must consider that of these four kinds of danger, that 1 Chapter I, Book V.

One should cause such troubles to one’s enemy and ward off those of one’s own. In the case of a person who is capable of causing or alleviating troubles, intrigue should be made use of; and in the case of a person who is of a reliable character, able to undertake works, and to favour his ally in his success, and to afford protection against calamities, counter-intrigue (pratijapa) should be made use of (to keep his friendship secure). It should also be considered whether the person is of good disposition or of obstinate temper (satha). The intrigue carried on by a foreigner of obstinate temper with local persons is of the following form : *' If after killing his own master, he comes to me, then I will secure these two objects, the destruction of my euerny and the acquisition of the enemy’s lauds ; or else my enemy kills him, with the consequence that the partisans of the relations killed, and other persons who are equally guilty, and are therefore apprehensive of similar punishment to themselves, will perturb my enemy’s peace when my enemy has no friends to count; or when my enemy fails to suspect any other person who is equally guilty, I shall be able to cause the death of this or that officer under my enemy’s own command.” The intrigue carried on by a local person of obstinate tem¬ per with a foreigner is of the following form : ” I shall either plunder the treasury of this king or destroy his army ; I shall murder my master by employing this man ; if my master consents, I shall cause him to march against an external enemy or a wild tribe; let his Circle of States he brought to confusion, let him incur enmity with them ; then it is easy to keep him under my power, aud conciliate him; or I myself shall seize the kingdom ; or having bound him in chains, I shall obtain both my master's land aud outside land ; or having caused the enemy (of my master) to march out, I shall cause the enemy to be murdered in good faith; or I shall seize the enemy’s capital when it is empty ( of soldiers).” When a person of good disposition makes a conspiracy for the 349 l*11***086 ac4uir‘ng what is to be enjoyed by both, then an agreement should be made with him. But when a person of obstinate temper so conspires, he should be allowed to have his own way and then deceived. Thus the form of policy to be adopted should be considered.

Of tliese, |t is better to try that which is mentione d first than that which h mentioned b(er in the order of c numeral ion, und which it is certain to ahak* off. Thus the determination of opportunities. Thus ends the discourse un danger. Regarding accuse in these dangi-roms situation* and times: in KAUTILYA’S ARTHAsASTRA 389 36 * case troubles from sons, brothers or relatives, it is better to secure relief by means of conciliation and gifts; in the case of troubles from citizens, country people, or chiefs of the army, it is by means of gifts and sowing the seeds of dissension ; in the case of troubles from a neighbouring king or wild tribes, it is by means of sowing the seeds of dissension and coercion. This is following the order of the means. In other kinds of situations, the same means may be employed in the reverse order. Success against friends and enemies is always achieved by com¬ plicated means ; for strategic means help each other. In the case of suspected ministers of an enemy, the employment of conciliation does not need the use of the other means ; in the case of treacherous ministers it is by means of gifts ; in the case of a combination of states, it is by means of sowing the seeds of dissension ; and in the case of the powerful, it is by means of coercion. When grave and light dangers are together apprehended, a particular means, or alternative means, or all the means may be employed. By this alone, but not by any other means/* is what is meant by a particular means. * By this or that/* is what is menfc by alternative means. “ By this as well as by that/* is what is meant by all the means. Of these, the single means as well as the combination of any three means are four (i.e. five on the whole); the combinations of any two means are six ; and the combination of all the four is one. Thus there are fifteen kinds of strategic means. Of the same number are the means in the reverse order. When a king attains success by only one means among these various means, he is called one of single success ; wlen by two, one of double success; when by three, one of treble success; and when by four, one of fourfold success. As virtue is the basis of wealth and as enjoymei* is the end of wealth, success in achieving that kind of wealth which promotes virtue, wealth and enjoyment is termed success in all (sarvartba- aiddhi). Thus varieties of success. Such providential visitations as fire, floods disease, pestilence Ipramara), fever (vidrava), famine, and demoniac troubles are dangerous. Success in averting these is to be *ught by worshipping gods and Brahmans. 25* 390 KAUTILVA'S ARTHASASTRA ♦Whether demoniacal troubles are absent, or are too many, or normal, the rites prescribed in the Atharvavfida, as well as the rites undertaken by accomplished ascetics, are to be performed for success.

Roads with obstruc¬ tions should be examined and cleared. Finance, the army, the strength of the armies of friends, enemies, and wild tribes, the pros¬ pect of rains, and the seasons should be thoroughly examined. When the protective power of fortifications and stores (of the enemies) is on its decay, when it is thought that distress of the hired army or of a friends army (of the enemy) is impending ; when intriguers are not for a quick march ; or when the enemy is likely to come to terms (with the invader), slow march should be made; otherwise quick march should be made. Waters may be crossed by means of elephants, planks spread over pillars erected, bridges, boats, timber and mass of bamboos, as well as by means of dry sour gourds, big baskets covered with skins, rafts, gapejika (?), aud vepika (?). When the crossing of a river is obstructed by the enemv, the invader may cross it elsewhere together wjth his elephant's and <horses, and entangle the enemy in an ambuscade (sattra). He should protect his army when it has to pass a long desert without water; when it is without grass, firewood and water ; when it has to traverse a difficult road ; when it is harassed by an enemy s attacks ; when it is suffering from hunger ant), thirst after a journey ; when it is ascending or descending a mountainous couutrv full of mire, water pools, rivers aud cataracts; when it finds itself •crowded in a narrow and difficult path ; when it is halting, starting or eating; when it is tired from a long march; when it is sleepy ; when it is suffering from a disease, pestilence or famine : when a great portion of its infantry, cavalry aud elephants is diseased ; when it is not sufficiently strong; or when it is under troubles. He should destroy the enemy's army imder such circumstances. When the enemy's army is marching through a path traversable by a single mau. the commander (of the invader’s army) should ascertain its strength by estimating the quantity of foodstuffs, grass. 394 KAUTILYA’S ARTHASASTRA bedding, and other requisites, fire pots (agninidhana), flags 366 and weapons. He should also conceal those of his own army. ♦Keeping a raountainous’or river fortress with all its resources at his back in his own country, he should fight or put up his camp.

End of the hundred and thirtieth chapter from the beginning.] CHAPTER III Forms of Treacherous Fights ; Encouragement to One s Own Army and Fight Between One’s Own and Enemy’s Armies He who is possessed of a strong army, who has succeeded in his intrigues, and who has applied remedies against dangers may under take an open fight, if he has secured a position favourable to himself ; otherwise a treacherous fight. He should strike the enemy when the latter’s army is under troubles or is furiously attacked ; or he who has secured a fa\our- able position may strike the enemy entangled in an unfavourable position. Or he who possesses control over the elements of his own state may, through the aid of the enemy’s traitors, enemies and inimical wild tribes, make a false impression of his own defeat on the mind of the enemy who is entrenched in a favourable position, and having thus dragged the enemy into an unfavourable position, he may strike the latter. When the enemy's army is in a compact body, he should break it by means of his elephants; when the enemy has come down from its favourable position, following the false impression of the invader’s defeat, the invader may turn back and strike the enemy’s army, broken or unbroken- Having strnck the front of the enemy’s army, he may strike it again bv means of his elephants and horses when it has shown its back and is running away. When frontal attack is unfavourable, he should strike it from behind; when attack on the rear is unfavourable, he should strike it in front; when attack on one side is unfavourable, he should strike it on the other. Or having caused the enemy to fight with his owu army of KAUT ILYA'S ARTUASAKTKA 390 traitors, enemies und wild tribes, the invader should with hh frr4. army strike the enemy when tired.

Physicians with surgical instruments (sastra), machines, remedial 369 °*k’ an<^ c*ot^ *n ^teir lands; and women with prepared food and beverage should stand behind, uttering encouraging words to fightiug men. The army should be arrayed on a favourable position, facing other than the south quarter, with its back turned to the sun, and capable to rush as it stands. If the array is made on an unfavourable spot, horses should be ruu. If the army arrayed on an unfavourable position is confined or is made to run away from it (by the enernv), it will be subjugated either as standing or running away ; otherwise it will conquer the enemy when standing or runuiug away. The even, uneven, and coraplexjuature of the ground in the front or on the sides or in the rear should be examined. On an even site, stall¬ like or circular array should be made ; aud ou an uneven ground, arrays of compact movement or of detached bodies should be made. Having broken the whole army (of the enemy), (the invader) should seek for peace; if the armies arc of equal strength, he should make peace when requested for it; and if the enemv’s army is inferior, he should attempt to destroy it, but not that which has secured a favourable position and is reckless of life. ♦When a broken army, reckless of life, resumes its attack, its fury becomes irresistible; hence he should not harass a broken armv (of the enemy).

With such an array free to move and having no confusion. one should fight. A bow menus five uratuis (o * 24 — 120 m\gu!as)+ Arohurs should be stationed at the distanca of five hows (from one Line to another}; the cavalry at the disLuinu of three bow*; and char iota or elephants at the distance of livt- bows. The intiTVe Ding space {iioikusundhij between wings, flanks and fruit of the urmy should be five bows. There must be three men to ojtjHMO a horn (pr&tijoddharah)} fifteen men or five horses to oppose a dm riot or au elephant; and ua many m (Gfteeii} servants (puliigopii) for a burse* a chariot and an < elephant should be maintained* Three groups (junta) of throe chariot* each should be stationed in front; the same number ou the two flanks and the two- wings. Thuia, in an array of chariot** the number of chariots amounts to fortj*flva; two hundred and twenty-live horae*, nix hundred and sevwty five illcd, and as many servants to attend tjjmn ihn hort-e-, chariots, and elephants—this is called an oven array of troops, The number uf chariots in this array (of ihrea groups of three aha riots each) aiBrT be increased by two and two till the iuerefeted number amounts to twenty-one-- Thus, this array of odd numbenof chariots given me to ten odd varieties. Thus tho surplus qf the army may therefore be distri bated in the above manner* Two-thirds of the hurplto) chariots may be ndded to the ilanks nod the wings* th* rest being put in front, Thus the added *urplu* *>f L-ikariotAshould be cue-third less (than the number added to the thuk* 401 KAUTILY.VS ARTHASASTRA and wings) This explains the distribution of surplus elephants and horses. As many horses, chariots and elephants may be added as occasion no confusion in fighting. Excess of the army is called surplus (avapa) ; deficiency in infantry is called absence of surplus' (pratyavapa); excess of any one of the four constituents of the army is akin to surplus (anvavapa); excess of traitors is far from surplus (atyavapa) ; in accordance with one’s own resources, one should increase one’s army from four to eight times the excess of the enemy’s army or the deficiency in the enemy’s infantry. The array of elephants is explained by the array of chariots. An array of elephants, chariots, and horses mixed together may also be made : at the extremities of the circle (array), elephants ; and on the flanks, horses, and principal chariots. The array in which the front is occupied by elephants, the flanks by chariots and the wings by horses, is an array which can break the centre of the enemy’s army ; the reverse of this can harass the extremities of the enemy’s army. An array of elephants may also be made : the front by such elephants ns are trained for war; the fhnks by such as are trained for riding ; and the wings by rogue elephants. In an array of horses, the front by horses with mail armour; and the flanks and wings by horses without armour. In an array of infantry, men dressed in mail armour in front, archers in the rear, and men without armour on the wings ; or horses on the wings, elephants on the flanks, and chariots in front; other changes may also be made so as to oppose the eneray’3 army successfully. The best army is that which consists of strong infantry and of such elephants and horses as are noted for their breed, birth, strength, youth, vitality, capacity to ran even in old age, fury, skill, firmness magnanimity, obedience, and good habits. One-third of the best of infantry, cavalry and elephants should be kept in front; two-thirds on both the flanks and wings ; the array of the army according to the strength of its constituents is in the direct order; that which is arrayed mixing one-third of strong and weak troops is in the reverse order. Thus, one should know all the varieties of arrying the army. Having stationed the weak troops at the extremities, one would be liable to the force of tbe enemy’s onslaught. Having stationed 1 Patti H»huWa exoeis of infantry is pratyavapa. 26 101 KAI7T1LYA*8 ARTHAglfrXKA r,h* flower of the irmy ifi front, one should make the winga equally ftrupp^.

In all these disputes, the conqueror should help the inferior party with men and money and set them again.st the superior party. When they are divided, he should remove them gyg (from their country) ; or lie may gather them together and cause them to settle in a cultivable part of their own country, under the designation of “ five households ” and “ ten households ” ; for when living together they can be trained in the art of wielding weapons. Specified fines should also be prescribed against any treacherous combinations among them. He may install as the heir- apparent a prince born of a high family, but dethroned or imprisoned. Spies, under the guise of astrologers and others, should bring to the notice of the corporations the royal characteristics of the prince, and should induce the virtuous leaders of the corporations to acknowledge their duty to the prince who is the son of such and such a king and who is the listener to their complaints. To those who are thus prevailed upon, the conqueror should send men and money for the purpose of winning over other partisans. On occasions of any affray, spies, under the guise of vintners, should, under the plea of the birth of a son, of marriage, or of the death of a man, distribute as toast (naishechaniku) hundreds of vessels of liquor adulterated with the juice of madana plant. Near the gates of altars (chaitya), temples, and other places under the watch of sentinels, spies should pretend to declare their agreement (with the enemy of the corporations), their mission, their rewards, and bags of money with the golden seals of the enemy ; when the corporations appear before the spies, they may tell the corporations that they (the spies) have sold themselves to the enemy, and challenge the corporations for war. Or having seized the draught animals and golden articles belonging to the corporations, they may give the most important of those animals and articles to the chief of the corporations and tell the corporations, when asked for, that it was given to the chief (for the purpose of causing quarrel among them). This explains the method of sowing the seeds of dissension in camps and among wild tribes. Or a spy may tell a self-confident son of the chief of corpora¬ tions : “ You are the son of such and sueh a king, and are kept here under the apprehension of danger from enemies.'’ When he is deluded with this belief, the conqueror may help him with meu and money and set him against the corporations. When the object in view is realised, the conqueror may also banish him.

Spie^t selected suitably, should accuse (the chiefs, by 410 KAUTILYA’S arthasastra saying: “ This man is the slayer of a Brahman and also the adulterer of a Brahman woman.” A spy, under the guise of an astrologer, may describe to a chief the destiny of a maiden who is at the point of being married to another, and say : “ This man’s daughter deserves to be the wife of a king, and will bring forth a son destined to be a king ; purchase her with all your wealth, or seize her by force ” Wheu it is not possible to secure her, spies should enrage the parties; but when she is secured quarrel will necessarily ensue. A mendicant woman may tell a chief who is fond of his wife : This (another) chief, proud of his youth, has sent me to entice your wife; being afraid of him, I have taken with me his letter and jewellery (for your wife); your wife is free from sin ; secret steps should be taken against him ; and I am very anxious (about your success).” ' Thus in these and other kinds of brawls which have originated of themselves or which have been brought about by spies, the conqueror should help the inferior party with men and money and set them against the wicked or cause them to migrate (to other parts of the country). Thus he should live as the only monarch of all the corporations; the corporations also, under the protection of such a single mouarch, should guard themselves against all kinds of treachery. *lhe chief of corporations should endear himself to all the people by leading a virtuous life, by controlling his passions, and by pursuing that course of action which is liked by all those who are his followers. [Thus ends Chapter I, “ Causes of Dissension, and Secret Punishment,” in Book XI, “ The (£duct of Corporations ” of the Arthasastra of Kautilya. End of the hundred and thirty-fifth chapter from the beginning. With this ends the Eleventh Book, ” The Conduct of Corpora¬ tions of the Arthasastra of Kautilya.] BOOK XII CONCERNING A POWERFUL ENEMY CHAPTER I The Duties of a Messenger When a king of poor resources is attacked by a powerful enemy, he should surrender himself together with his sons to the 382 enemy and live like a reed (in the midst of a current of water). Bharadvaja says that he who surrenders himself to the strong, bows down before Indra (the god of rain). But Visaluksha says that a weak king should rather fight with all his resources, for bravery destroys all troubles ; this (fighting) is the natural duty of a Kshatriva, no matter whether he achieves victory or sustains defeat in battle. No, says Kautilya, he who bows down to all like a crab on the banks (of a river) lives in despair ; whoever goes with his small army to fight perishes like a man attempting to cross the sea without a boat. Hence, a weak king should either seek the protection of a powerful king or maintain himself in an impreg¬ nable fort. Invaders are of three kinds : a just conqueror, a demon like conqueror, and a greedy conqueror. Of these, the just conqueror is satisfied with mere obeisance. Hence, a weak king should seek his protection. Fearing his own enemies, the greedy conqueror is satisfied with what he can safely gain in land or money. Hence, a weak king should satisfy such a conqueror with wealth. The demon-like conqueror satisfies himself not merely by seizing the land, treasure, sons and wives of the conquered, but by taking the life of the latter. Hence, a king should keep such a conqueror at a distance by offering him land and wealth. W hen any one of these is on the point of rising against a weak king, the latter should avert the invasion by making a treaty of peace, or by taking recourse to the battle of intrigue (mantra- 412 KAtTTILYA'S AKTHASASTRA vuddha), or by a treacherous fight in the battlefield. Ho may reduce the enemy’s men either by conciliation or by giving gifts, and should prevent the treacherous proceedings of his own men either by sowing the seeds of dissension among them or by punishing them. Spies, under concealment, may capture the enemy’s fort, country, or camp with the aid of weapons, poison, or fire. He may 383 l|ara*8 ftnem.v S rear on sides; and he may devastate the enemy’s country through the help of wild tribes. Or he may set up a scion of the enemy’s family or an imprisoned prince to seize the enemy’s territory. When all his mischief has been perpetrated, a messenger may be sent to the enemy (to sue for peace); or he may make peace with the enemy without offending the latter. If the enemy still continues the march, the weak king may sue for peace by offering more than one-fourth of his wealth and army, the payment being made after the lapse of a day and night. If the enemy desires to make peace on condition of the weak king surrendering a portion of this army, he may give the enemy such of his elephants and cavalry as are uncontrollable or as are provided with poison : if the enemy desires to make peace on condition of his surrendering his chief men, he may send over to the enemy such portion of his army as is full of traitors, enemies and wild tribes under the command of a trusted officer, so that both his enemy and his own undesirable army may perish : or he may provide the enemy with an army composed of fiery spies, taking care to satisfy his own disappointed men (before sending them over to the enemy); or he may transfer to the enemy his own faithful and hereditary army that is capable to hurt the enemy on occasions of trouble ; if the enemy desires to make peace on condition of his paying a certain amount of wealth, he may give the enemy such precious articles as do not find a purchaser or such raw products as are of no use in war ; if the enemy desires to make peace on condition of his ceding a part of his land, he should provide the enemy with that kind of land which he can recover, which is always at the mercy of another enemy, which possesses no protective defences, or which can he colonized at considerable cost of men and money ; or he may make peace, surrendering bis whole state except his capital. •He should so contrive as to make the enemy accept that which another enemy is likely to carry off by force ; and he should take KAUTILYAS ARTHASASTRA 413 care more of his person than of his wealth, for of what interest is perishing wealth ? [Thus ends Chapter I, “ The Duties of a Messenger, and Request for Peace,** in Book XII, “Concerning a Powerful Enemy*’ of the Arthasastra of Kaufcilya. End of the hundred and thirty-sixth chapter from the beginniug.] CHAPTER II Battle of Intrigue 384 If the enemy does uot keep peace, he should be told : “ These kings perished by surrendering themselves to the aggre¬ gate of the six enemies ; it is not worthy of you to follow the lead of these unwise kings ; be mindful of virtue and wealth ; those who advise you to brave danger, sin and violation of wealth, are euemies under the guise of friends;*it is dangerous to fight with men who are reckless of their own lives ; it is sin to cause the loss of life of on both sides; it is violation of wealth to abandon the wealth at hand and the friend of no mean character (meaning the addresser himself) ; that king has many friends whom he will set against you with the same wealth (that is acquired with your help at my expense), and who will fall upon you from all sides ; that king has uot lost his influence over the Circle of the MadhyAma and neutral states; but you have lost that power over them who are, therefore, waiting for an opportunity to fall upon you ; patiently bear the loss of men and money again ; break peace with that friend ; then we shall be able to remove him from that stronghold over which he has lost his influence. Hence, it is uot worthy of you to lend your ear to those enemies with the face of friends, to expose your real friends to trouble, to help your enemies to attain success, and to involve your¬ self in dangers costing life and wealth.*' If without caring for the advice, the enemy proceeds on his oWn *ay, the weak king should create disaffection among the enemy’s people by adopting such measures as are explained in the ’chapters’, ‘ The Conduct of Corporations,** 1 and “ Enticement of the Enemy by Secret Contrivances.,*, He should also make use of fiery spies and poison. Against w hat is described as deserving protection in'thrf chapter, “Safety of His Own Person,” * fiery spies and poisoners 1 Chapter I, Book X. * Chappy II, Book XIII, 1 Chapter XXI, Book I. 414 KAUTILYA'S ARTHAhaSTKA should be employed tin the enemy’s court)- Keepers of harlots should excite love ia the minds of the leaders of the enemy’s army by exhibiting women endowed with youth and beauty* Fiery spies should bring about quarrels among them when one or two of them have fallen in fove, In the affray that ensues they should prevail upon the defeated party to migrate elsewhere or to proceed to help the master (of the spies) in the invasion undertaken by the latter. Or to those who have fallen in love, spies, under the guise of ascetics, may administer poison under the plea that the medical drugs given to them are capable of securing the object of love, A spy, under the guise of a merchant, may, under the plea of winning the love of an immediate maid-servant of the beautiful queen (of the enemy), shower wealth upon her and then give her up. A spy in the service of the merchant may give to another spy, employed as a servant of the maid-servant, some medical drug, telling the latter that (in order to regain the bve of the merchant) the drug may be applied to the person of the merchant (by the maid-servant). On her attaining success (the maid-servant) may inform the queen that the same dr 113 may be applied to the person of the king (to secure his lovej, and then change the drug for poison. A spy, under the guise of an astrologer, may gradually delude the enemy’s prime minister with the belief that be is possessed of all the physiognomical characteristics of a king; a mendicant woman may tell the miimter’s wife that she h:ts the characteristics of a queen and that she will bring forth a priuce ; or a womanf disguised as the minister’s wife, may tell him that. The king is troubling me ; and an ascetic woman has brought to me this letter and jewellery.” Spies, under the guise of cooks, may, under the pretence of the king’s Uhe enemy’s) order, take some covetablo wealth (to the minister) meant for use in an immediate expedition# A spy, under the guise of a merchant, may, by some contrivance or other, take possession of that wealth and inform the minister of the readiness of all the preparations (for the expedition). Thus by the employ^ ment of one, two, or three of the strategic means, the ministers of each of the combined enemies may be induced to set out on the expedition, and thus to be away from the inimical kings. Spies, under the service of the officer in charge of the enemy 8 waste lands, may inform the citizens and country people residing in 415 KAIJTILYA’S ARTHASARTRA the enemy’s fortified towns of the condition of the officer’s friendship with the people, and say : 41 The officer in charge of the waste lands tells the warriors and departmental officers thus: 4 The king has hardly escaped from danger and scarcely returns with life. Do not 386 k°arc* up your wealth and thereby create euemies; if so, you will all be put to death.* 99 When all the people are collected together, fiery spies may take the citizens out of the town and kill their leaders, saying: 44 Thus will be treated those who da not hear the officer in charge of the waste lands.” On the waste lands under the charge of the officer, the spies may throw down weapons, money and ropes bespattered with blood. Then other spies may spread the news that the officer in charge of the waste lands destroys the people and plunders them. Similarly, spies mnv cause disagreement between the enemy’s collector-general and the people. Addressing the servants of the collector-general in the centre of the village at night, fiery spies may say : “Thus will be treated those who subject the people to unjust oppression.” When the fault of the collector-general or of the officer in charge of the waste lands is widely known, the spies may cause the people to slay either of them, and employ in his place one of his family or one who is imprisoned. •Spreading the false news of the danger of the enemy, they (spies) may set fire to the harem, the gates of the town and the store-house of grains and other things, and slay the sentinels who are kept to guard them. [Thus ends Chapter II. “The Duties of a Messenger and Battle of Intrigue.” in Book XII, 44Concerning a Powerful Enemy” of the ArthaAastra of Kautilya. End of 44 Battle of Intrigue.,, End of the hundred and thirty-seventh chapter from the beginning.] CHAPTER TIT Slaying the Commander-In-Chief and Inciting a Circle of States Spies in the service of the king (the enemy) or of his courtiers may, under the pretence of friendship, say in the presence of other friends that the king is angry with the chiefs of infantry, cavalry, chariots y and elephants. When their men are collected together, fiery spies, having guarded themselves against night watches, may 416 KACTILYA'S ARTHaSASTRA under the pretence of the king's (the enemy's) order, invite the chiefs to a certain house and alay the chiefs when returning from the house. Other spies in the vicinity may say that it has been the king’s (the enemy’s, order to slay them* Spies may also tell those who have been banished from the country: “This is just what we foretold ; for personal safety, Von to ay go elsewhere." Spies may also tell thbse who have not received what they requested of the king (the enemy) that the officer in charge of waste lands have been told by the king : “Such and such a person has begged of me what he should not demand ; I refused to grant his request; he is in conspiracy with my enemy. So mske attempts to put him down.” Then the spies may proceed in their usual way. Spies may also tell those who have been granted their request by the king (the enemy) that the officer in charge of waste lands has been told by the king : “ Such and such persons have demanded their due from me; I have granted them all their requests in order to gain their confidence. But they are conspiring with my enemy. So make attempts to put them down.” Then the spies may proceed in their usual way. Spies may also tell those who do not demand their due from the king that the officer in charge of waste lands has been told: “ 8uch and such persons do not demand their due from tne. What else can be the reason than their suspicion about ray knowledge of their guilt ? So make attempts to put them down.” Then the spies may proceed in their usual way. This explains the treatment of partisans. A spy employed as the personal servant of the king (the enemy) may inform him that such and such ministers of his are being inter¬ viewed by the enemy’9 servants. When he comes to believe this* some treacherous persons may be represented the messengers of the enemy, specifying as “ this is that.” The chief officers of the army, the minister and other officers may be induced by offering land and gold to fall against their own 3S8 men an<^ sec®^e from enemy (their king). If one of the sons of the commander-in-chief is living near or inside the fort, a spy may tell him : “ Yod are the most worthy son ; still you are neglected ; wby are yon indifferent ? Seize yonr position by force : otherwise the heir-apparent will destroy yoa.,, Or some one of the family (of the commander-in-chief of the king), or one who is imprisoned may be bribed in gold and told : 417 KAUTILYA’S arthasastra Destroy the internal strength of the enemy, or a portion of his force in the border of his country or anv other army.” Or having seduced wild tribes with rewards of wealth and honour, they may be iucited to devastate the enemy’s country. Or the enemy’s rear enemy may be told : “ I am, as it were, a bridge to you all; if I am broken like a rafter, this king will down you all ; let us, therefore, combine and thwart the enemy in his march.” Accordingly, a message may be sent to individual or combined states to the effect: “ After having done with me, this king will do his work of you : beware of it. I am the best man to be relied upon.”* *In order to escape from the danger from an immediate enemy, a king should frequently send to a Madhyama or a neutral king (whatever would please him) ; or one may put one’s whole property at the enemy’s disposal. [Thus ends Chapter III, ” Slaving the Commander-in-Chief and Inciting a Circle of States,” in Book XII. ” Concerning a Powerful Enemy ” of the Arthasastra of Kautilya. End of the hundred and thirty-eighth chapter from the beginning.] CHAPTER IV Sptes with Weapons, Fire, and Poison ; and Destrcction of Supply, Stores and Granaries The conqueror’s spies who are residing as traders in the enemy’s forts, and those who are living as cultivators in the enemy’s villages, 389 aS we^ 118 ^ose who are living as cowherds or ascetics in the district borders of the enemy’s country, may send through merchants information to another neighbouring enemy, or a wild chief, or a scion of the enemy’s family, or an imprisoned prince, that the enemy’s country is to be captured. When their secret emissaries come as invited, they are to be pleased with rewards of wealth and honour and shown the enemy’s weak poiuts ; and with the help of the emissaries, the spies should strike the enemy at his weak points. Or having put a banished prince in the enemy’s camp, a spy, disguised as a vintner, in the service of the enemy, may distribute as a toast hundreds of vessels of liquor mixed with the juice of the madana plant; or, for the first day, he may distribute a mild or intoxicating variety of liquor, and on the following days such liquor 27 418 KAUTILYA’S ARTHASASTRA as is mixed with poisou ; or having given pure liquor to the officers of the enemy’s army, he may give them poisoned liquor when ihey .are in intoxication. A spy, employed as a chief officer of the enemy’s army, may adopt the same measures as those employed by the vintner. Spies, disguised as experts in trading in cooked flesh, cooked rice, liquor, and cakes, may vie with each other in proclaiming in public the sale of a fresh supply of their special articles at cheap price, and may sell the articles mixed with poison to the attracted customers of the enemy. Women and children may receive, in their poisoned vessels, liquor, milk, curd, ghee, or oil from traders in those articles, and pour those fluids back into the vessels of the traders, saying that at a specified rate the whole inav be sold to them. Spies, disguised as merchants, may purchase the above articles, aud rnay so contrive that servants, attending upon the elephants aud horses of the enemy, may make use of the same articles in giving rations and grass to those animals. Spies, under the garb of servants, may sell poisoned S90 &raS8 an^ water- Spies, let off as traders in cattle for a long time, may leave herds of cattle, sheep, or goats in tempting places, so us to divert the attention of the enemy from the attack which they (the enemy) intend to make; spies, as cowherds, may let off such animals as are ferocious among horses, mules* camels, buffaloes and other beasts, having smeared the eyes of those animals with the blood of a musk rat (chuchundari); spies, as huuters, may let off cruel beasts from traps; spies, as snake charmers, may let off highly poisonous snakes ; those who keep elephants may let off elephants (near the enemy’s camp); those who live by making use of fire may set fire (to the camp, etc.). Secret spies may slay from behind the chiefs of infantry, cavalry, chariots aud elephants, or they may set fire to the chief residences of the enemy. Traitors, enemies and wild tribes, employed for the purpose, may destroy the enemy’s rear or obstruct his reinforcement; or spies, concealed in forests, may enter into the border of the enemy’s country, and devastate it; or they may destroy the enemy's supply, stores, and other things, when those thiugs are being conveyed on a narrow path passable by a single man. Or in accordance with a pre concerted plan, they may, on the occasion of a night-battle, go to the enemy’s capital, and blowing a large number of trumpets, cry aloud : 44 We have entered into the 419 • KAUTJLYA’S ARTHASASTRA capital, and the country has been conquered.” After entering into the king’s (the enemy’s) palace, they may kill the king in the tumult; when the king begins to run from one direction to another, Mlechchhas, wild tribes, or chiefs of the army, lying in ambush (sattra), or concealed near a pillar or a fence, may slay him ; or spies, under the guise of hunters, may slay the king when he is directing his attack, or in the tumult of attack following the plan of treacherous fights. Or. occupying an advantageous position, they may slay the enemy when he is marching in a narrow path passable by a single man, or on a mountain, or near the trunk of a tree, or under the branches of a banyan tree, or in water ;or they may cause him to be carried off by the force of a current of water let off by the destruction of a dam across a river, or of a lake or pond ; or they may destroy him by means of an explosive fire or poisonous snake when he has entrenched himself in a fort, in a desert, in a forest, or in a valley. He should be destroyed with fire when he is under a thicket; with smoke when he is in a desert; with poison when he is in a comfortable place; w ith crocodile and other cruel beasts when he is in water; or they may slay him when he is going out of his burning house. •By means of such measures as are narrated in the chapter, 3gj “ Enticement of the Enemy by Secret Means,”1 or by any other measures, the enemy should be caught hold of in places to which he is confined or from which he is attempting to escape. [Thus ends Chapter IV, " Spies with Weapons, Fire and Poison; and Destruction of Supply, Stores and Granaries,” in Book XII, ‘‘Concerning a Powerful Enemy ” of the Artbasastra of Kautilya. End of the hundred and thirty-ninth chapter from the beginning ] CHAPTER V Capture op the Enemy by Means of Secret Contrivances or BY Means of the Army; and Complete Victory Contrivances to kill the enemy may be formed in those places of worship and visit, which the enemy, under the influence of faith, frequents on occasions of worshipping gods and of pilgrimage. A wall or a stone, kept by mechanical contrivance, may, by 1 Chapter I, Book XIII. 420 KAUTILYA’S ARTHASASTRA loosening the fastenings, be let to fall on the head of the enemv when he has entered into a temple; stones and weapons may be showered over his head from the topmost story ; or a door-panel may be let to fall ; or a huge rod kept over a wall or partly attached to a wall may be made to fall over him ; or weapons kept inside the body of an idol may be thrown over his head ; or the floor of those places where he usually stands, sits, or walks may be besprinkled with poison mixed with cowdung or with pure water ; or, under the plea of giving him flowers, scented powders, or of causing scented smoke, he may be poisoned ; or by removing the fastenings made under a cot or a scat, he may be made to fall into a pit containing pointed spears ; or when he is eager to escape from impending imprisonment in his own country, he may be led away to fall into the hands of a wild tribe or an enemy waiting for him not far from his country, or when he is eager to get out of his castle, he may be likewise misled or made to enter an enemy’s country which is to be restored (to the conqueror); the enemy’s people should also be kept under the protection of sons aud brotbiMs (of the conqueror) in some forts on a mountain, or in a forest, or in the midst of a river separated from the enemy’s country by wild tracts of land. Measures to obstruct the movements of the enemy are explained in the chapter, “ The Conduct of a Conquered King.”1 brass and firewood should be set on tire us far as a vojuna 392 * ’ Wu*er ®hould be vitiated aud caused to fiow away ; mounds, wells, pits and thorns (outside the fort wail) should be destroyed ; having widened the mouth of the underground tunnel of the enemy s fort, his stores and leaders may be removed ; the enemy may also be likewise carried off when the underground tunnel has been raude by the enemy for his own use, the water in the ditch outside the fort may be made to fiow into it ; in suspicious places along the parapet lof the enemy’s fort) and in the house con¬ taining a well outside the fort, empty pots or bronze vessels may be placed in order to find out the direction of the wind (blowing from the underground tunnel); when the direction of the tunnel is found out, a counter tunnel may be formed ; or having opened the tunnel, it may be filled with smoke or water. Having arranged for the defeuce of the fort by a scion of his 1 Chapter XV, Book VII. 421 KAUTILYA’8 arthasastka family, the enemy may run in an opposite direction where it is possible for him to meet with friends, relatives, or wild tribes, or with his enemy’s treacherous friends of vast resources, or where he may separate his enemy from the latter’s friends, or where he may capture the enemy’s rear, or country, or where he may prevent the transport of supplies to his enemy, or whence he may strike his enemy by throwing down trees at hand, or where he can find means to defend his own country or to gather reinforcements for his hereditary army ; or he may go to any other country whence he can obtain peace on his own terms. His enemy’s (the conqueror’s) allies may send a mission to him, saying: “ This man, your enemy, has fallen into our hands; under the plea of merchandise or some presentation, send gold and a strong force; wre shall either hand over to you your enemy bound in chains, or banish him.” If he approves of it, the gold and the army he may send may be received (by the conqueror). Having access to the enemy’s castle, the officer in charge of the boundaries (of the enemy’s country) may lead a part of his force and slay the enemy in good faith ; under the plea of destroying a people in some place, he may take the enemy to an inimical army ; and having led the enemy to the surrounded place, he may slay the enemy in good faith. A pretending friend may send information to an outsider: 44 Grains, oil and jaggery and salt stored in the fort (of the enemy) 2Q2 have been exhausted ; a fresh supply of them is expected to reach the fort at such and such a place and time; seize it by force.” Then traitors, enemies, or wild tribes, or some other persons specially appointed for the purpose, may send a supply of poisoned grains, oil, jaggery, and salt to the fort. This explains the seizure of ail kinds of supply. Having made peace with the conqueror, he may give the conqueror part of the gold promised and the rest gradually. Thus he may cause the conqueror’s defensive forces to be slackened and then strike them down with fire, poison or sword ; or he may win the confidence of the conqueror’s courtiers deputed to take the tribute. Or if his resources are exhausted, he may run away, abandoning his fort; he may escape through a tunnel or through a hole newly *nade, or by breaking the parapet. Or having challenged the conqueror at night, he may successfully 27* 422 KAUTILYA’S ARTHASASTRA confront the attack ; if he cannot do this, he may run away by a side path ; or, disguised a* a heretic, he may escape with a small retinue ; or he may be carried off by spies as a corpse ; or disguised as a woman, he may follow a corpse (as it were, of her husband to the cremation ground); or on the occasion of feeding the people in honour of gods or of ancestors or in some festival, he may make use of poisoned rice and water, and having conspired with his enemy’s traitors, he may strike the enemy with his concealed army ; or, when he is surrounded in his fort, he may lie concealed in a hole bored into the body of an idol after eating sacramental food and setting up an altar ; or he may lie in a secret hole in a wall, or in a hole made in the body of an idol in an underground chamber; and when he is forgotten, he may get out of his concealment through a tunnel, and, entering into the palace, slay his enemy while sleeping, or loosening the fastening of a machine (yantra), he may let it fall on his enemy ; or when his enemy is lying in a chamber which is besmeared with poisonous and explosive 2^ substances, or which is made of lac, he may set fire to it. Fiery spies, hidden in an underground chamber, or in a tunnel, or inside a secret wall, may slay the enemy when the latter is carelessly amusing himself in a pleasure park or any other place of recreation ; or spie9 under concealment may poison him ; or women under concealment may throw a snake, or poison, or fire or poisonous smoke over his person when he is asleep in a confined place ; or spi*»s, having access to the enemy's harem, may, when opportunities occur, do to the enemy whatever is found possible on the occasion, and then get out inknown. On such occasions, they should make use of the sign? indicative of the purpose of their society. •Having by means of trumpet sounds called together the sentinels at the gate, as well a? aged men and other spies stationed by others, the enemy may completely carry out the rest of his work.

With tliis ends the Twelfth Book, 44 Concerning a Powerful Enemy of the Arthasastra of Kautilya.] BOOK XIII STRATEGIC MEANS TO CAPTURE A FORTRESS CHAPTER I Sowing the Seeds of Dissension When the conqueror is desirous of seizing an enemy’s village, be should infuse enthusiastic spirit among his own men and frighten his enemy’s people by giving publicity to his power of omniscience and close association with gods. Proclamation of his omniscience is as follows: rejection of his chief officers when their secret domestic and other private affairs are known ; revealing the names of traitors after receiving infor¬ mation from spies specially employed to find out such men ; pointing out the impolitic aspect of any course of action suggested to him; and pretensions to the knowledge of foreign affairs by means of his power to read omens and signs invisible to others w'hen information about foreign affairs is just received through a domestic pigeon which has brought a sealed letter. Proclamation of his association with gods is as follows: holding _ _ conversation with, and worshipping, the spies who pretend to be the gods of fire or altar when through a tunnel they come to stand in the midst of fire, altar, or in the interior of a hollow image ; holding conversation with, and worshipping, the spies who rise up from water and pretend to be the gods and goddesses of Nugas (snakes); placing under water at night a mass of sea-foam mixed with burning oil, and exhibiting it as the sponta¬ neous outbreak of fire, when it is burning in a line; sitting on a raft in water, which is secretly fastened by a rope to a rock ; such magical performance in water as is usually done at night by bands of magicians, using the sack of abdomen or womb of water animals to hide the head and the nose, and applying to the nose the oil, prepared from the entrails of red spotted deer and the serum of the flesh of the crab, crocodile, porpoise and otter ; holding con\er- sation, as though with women of \arupa (the god of water), or of 424 KAUTILYA’S ARTHASASTRA Naga (the snake-god), when they are performing magical tricks in water ; and sending out volumes of smoke from the mouth on occasions of anger.' Astrologers, soothsayers, horologists, story tellers (Pauranika), as well as those who read the forebodings of every moment, together with spies and their disciples, inclusive of those who have • witnessed the wonderful performances of the conqueror, should give wide publicity to the power of the king to associate with gods throughout his territory. Likewise in foreign countries, they should spread the news of gods appearing before the conqueror and of his having received from heaven weapons and treasure. Those who are well versed in horary and astrology and the science of omens should proclaim abroad that the conqueror is a successful expert in explain¬ ing the indications of dreams and in understanding the language of beasts and birds. They should not only attribute the contrary to his enemy, but also show to the enemy’s people the shower of firebrand (ulka) with the noise of drums (from the sky) on the day of the birth-star of the enemy. The conqueror’s chief messengers, pretending to be friendly towards the enemy, should highly speak of the conqueror’s respect¬ ful treatment of visitors, of the strength of his army, and of the likelihood of impending destruction of his enemy’s men. They should also make it known to the enemy that, under their master, both ministers and soldiers are equally safe and happy, and that their master treats his servants with parental care in their weal or woe. By these and other means they should win over the enemy’s men as pointed out above, and as we are going to treat of them again at length : They should characterise the enemy as an ordinary donkey towards skilful persons; as the branch of lakucha (Artocarpus Lacucha) broken to the officers of his array ; as a goat on the shore to anxious persons; as a downpour of lightnings to those who are treated with contempt; as a reed, a barren tree, or an iron ball, or as false clouds to those who are disappointed ; as the orna- ments of an ugly woman to those who are disappointed in spite of their worshipful service; as a tiger’s skin, or as a 1 These and other magical tricks, employed by ancient kings for political purposes, satisfactorily explain the origin and growth of Pnranic Mythology. No one can believe them as real miracles in the face ofChanakya’s plain statement of tho tricks. 425 KAUTILYA’S ARTHAS.lSTRA trap of death to his favourites ; and as eating a piece of the wood of pilu (Careva-Arborea), or as churning the milk of a she-camel or a she-donkey (for butter) to those who are rendering to him valuable help. When the people of the enemy are convinced of this, they may be sent to the conqueror to receive wealth and honour. Those of the enemy who are in need of money and food should be supplied with an abundance of those things. Those who do not like to receive such things may be presented with ornaments for their wives and children. When the people of the enemy are suffering from famine and the oppression of thieves and wild tribes, the conqueror’s spies should sow the seeds of dissension among them, saying: Let us request the king for favour, and, go elsewhere if not favoured. •When they agree to such proposals, they should be supplied with money, grains, and other necessary help: thus, much can be done by sowing the seeds of dissension. [Thus ends Chapter I, 44 Sowing the Seeds of Dissension,” in Book XIII, "Strategic Means to Capture a Fortress” of the Arthasastra of Kautilya. End of the hundred and forty-first chapter from the beginning.] CHAPTER II Enticement of Kings by Secret Contrivances An ascetic, with shaved head or braided hair and living in the cave of a mountain, may pretend to be four hundred years old, and, follow¬ ed by a number of disciples with braided hair, halt in the vicinity of the capital city of the enemy. The disciples of the ascetic may make presentations of roots and fruits to the king and his ministers and invite them to pay a visit to the venerable ascetic. On the arrival of the king on the spot, the ascetic may acquaint him with the history of ancient kings and their states, and tell him . Every time when I complete the course of a hundred years, I enter into the fire and come out of it as a fresh youth (bala). Now, here in your preseuce, I am going to enter into the fire for the fourth time. It is highly necessary that you may be pleased to honour me with your presence at the time. Please request three boons.” When the king agrees to do so, he may be requested to come and 426 KAl/TILYA’S ARTHASASTRA remain at the spot with his wives and children for seven nights to witness the sacrificial performance. When he does so, he may be caught hold of. An ascetic, with shaved head or braided hair, and followed by a number of disciples with shaved heads or braided hair, and pretend¬ ing to be aware of whatever is contained in the interior of theearthf may put in the interior of an ant-hill either a bamboo stick wound round with a piece of cloth drenched in blood and painted with gold dust, or a hollow golden tube into which a snake can enter aud remain. One of the disciples may tell the king: “ This ascetic can discover blooming treasure trove.99 When he asks the ascetic (as to the veracity of the statement), the latter should acknowledge it, and produce a confirmatory evidence (by pullingiout the bamboo stick); or having kept some more gold in the interior of the ant-hill, the ascetic may tell the king : “ This treasure trove is guarded by a snake and can possibly be taken out by performing necessary sacrifice. When the king agrees to do so, he may be requested to come aud remain.(as before). W hen an ascetic, pretending to be able to find out hidden treasure trove, is seated w’ith his body burning with magical fire at night in a lonely place, disciples may bring the king to see him and inform the king that the ascetic can find out treasure trove. While engaged in performing some work at the request of the king, the latter may be requested to come and remain at the spot for seven nights.(as before). Au accomplished ascetic may beguile a king by his knowledge of the science of magic known as jambhaka, and request him to come and remain.(as before). An accomplished ascetic, pretending to have secured the favour of the powerful guardian deity of the country, may often beguile the king 8 chief ministers with his wonderful performance and gradually impose upon the king. Any person, disgaised as an ascetic aud living under abater or in the interior of an idol entered into through a tunnel or an under¬ ground chamber, may be said by his disciples to be Varuna, the god oi water, or of the king of snakes, and show n to the king. While going to accomplish whatever the king may desire, the latter may be requested to come aud remain.(as before). Au accomplished ascetic, halting in the vicinity of the capital city, may invite the king to witness the person (of khis enemy). 427 KAUTILY.VS ARTHASASTRA When he comes to'witness the invocation of his enemy’s life OAO in the image to be destroyed, he may be murdered in an unguarded place. Spies, under the guise of merchants come to sell horses, may invite the king to examine and purchase any of the animals. While attentively examining the horses, he may be murdered in the tumult or trampled down by horses. Getting into an altar at night in the vicinity of the capital city of the enemy and blowing through tubes or hollow reeds the fire con¬ tained in a few pots, some fiery spies may shout aloud : “ We are going to eat the flesh of the king or of his ministers ; let the wor¬ ship of the gods go on.” Spies, under the guise of soothsayers and horologists, may spread the news abroad. Spies, disguised as Nagas (snake-gods) and with their body besmeared with burning oil (tejanataila), may stand in the centre of a sacred pool of water or of a lake at night, and sharpening their iron swords or spikes, may shout aloud as before. Spies, wearing coats formed of the skins of bears and sending out volumes of smoke from their mouth, may pretend to be demons, and after circumambulating the city thrice from right to U*ft, may shout aloud as before at a place full of the horrid noise of antelopes and jackals ; or spies may set fire to an altar or an image of a god covered with a layer of mica besmeared with burning oil at night, and shout aloud as before. Others may spread this news abroad ; or they may cause (by some contrivance ot other) blood to flow out in floods from revered images of gods. Others may point to the flow of blood and say that it is an indication.of defeat to the enemy. On the night of full or new moon days or in the vicinity of a crema¬ tion ground they may point to a Chaitya tree with a human corpse, the upper part of which is eaten away. One, disguised as a demon, may call from the tree for the offering of a human victim. If a man boldly comes out to witness this, others may beat him to death with iron rods and make the people believe that he was killed by demons. Spies and other witnesses raay inform the king of this wonder. Then spies, disguised as soothsayers and astrologers, may prescribae uspicious and expiatory rites to avert the evil con¬ sequences which would otherwise overtake the king and his country. When the king agrees to the proposal, he may be asked to perform 1 See Chapter II, Book XIV. 428 KAUTII.YA’S ARTHASiSTRA in person special sacrifices and offerings with special mantras every night for seven days. Then (while doing this, he inay be slain) as before. In order to delude other kings, the conqueror may himself undertake the performance of expiatory rites to avert such evil con¬ sequences as the above, and thus set an example to others. In view of averting the evil consequences of uunatural occur¬ rences, he (the conqueror) may collect money (from his subjects). \\ hen the enemy is fond of elephants, spies may delude him with the sight of a beautiful elephant reared by the officer iu charge of elephant forests. When he desires to capture the elephant, he may be taken to a remote desolate part of the forest, and killed or earned off as a prisoner. This explains the fate of kings addicted to lianting. When the enemy is fond of wealth or women, he may be beguiled at the sight of rich and beautiful widows brought before him with a plaint for the recovery of a deposit kept by them in the custody of one of their kinsmen ; and when he comes to meet with a woman at n*^kt as arranged, hidden spies may kill him with weapons or poison. When the enemy is in the habit of paying frequent visits to ascetics, altars, sacred pillars (stupa), and images of gods, spies biddeu in underground chambers or in subterranean passages, or inside the walls, may strike him down. •Whatever may be the sights or spectacles which the king goes »n person to witness : wherever he may engage himself in sports or in swimming in water ; .**ie”ver 116 m*y be careless in uttering such words of rebuke “ Tut, ’ or on the occasions of sacrificial performance, or during the accouchement of women, or at the time of death or disease (of some person in the palace), or at the time of love, sorrow, or fear; * 400 "whatever may be the festivities of his own men, which the king goes to attend, wherever he is unguarded, or during a cloudy day, or in the tumultuous concourse of people; •or in au assembly oi Brahmans, or whenever he may go in person to see the outbreak of fire, or when he is in a lonelv place, or when he is putting on dress or ornaments, or garlands of flower, or when he is lying in his bed or sitting on a seat; •or when he is eating or drinking, on these and other occasions. KAUTILYA’S ARTH AS ASTRA 429 spies, together with other persons previously hidden at those places, may strike him down at the sound of trumpets. ♦And they may get out as secretly as they came there with the pretence of witnessing the sights; thus it is that kings and other persons are enticed to come out and be captured.

End of the hundred and fortv-second chapter from the beginning.J CHAPTER III The Work of Spiks in a Sibgk The conqueror may dismiss a confidential chief of a corporation. The chief may go over to the enemy as a friend and offer to supply him with recruits aud other help collected from the conqueror's territory ; or, followed by a band of spies, the chief may please the enemy by destroying a disloyal village or a regiment or an ally of the conqueror, and by sending as a present the elephants, horses, and disaffected persons of the conqueror s army or of the latter's ally; or a confidential chief officer of tue conqueror may solicit help from a portion of the territory (of the enemy), or from h corporation of people (sreoU or from wild tribes; and when he has gained their confidence, he may send them down to the conqueror to be routed down on th6 occasiou of a farcical attempt to capture elephants or wild tribes. This explains the work of ministers and wild chiefs under the mission of the conqueror. After making peace with the enemy, the conqueror may dismiss his own confidential ministers. They muy request the enemy to reconcile them to their master. W hen the enemy sends a messenger for this purpose, the conqueror may rebuke him and say : 44 Thy master attempts to sow the seeds of dissension between mvself aud my ministers; so thou should not come here again.” Then oue of 401 ^ dismissed ministers may go over to the enemy, taking with him a band of spies, disaffected people, traitors, brave thieves, and wild tribes who make no distinction between a friend and a foe. Having secured the good graces of the enemy, the minister may propose to him the destruction of his officers, such as j(M KAVJihYA^ ARTHA&hBVRA tin? b^tindurv-guard, wild chief, and commander of Kb army, telling fcni 'These nod other peraoitnare in nonccst with your enemy."

When tbs enemy is desirous of taking possession of tbe territory of tb# conqueror's friend. then the conqueror may* under the pretence of compliance, supply the enemy with army.

If he attempts to defend bin 431 KAUTILYA’S ARTH AS ASTRA territory by his army, that army may be annihilated. If the enemy and his ally cannot be separated, then each of these may be openly asked to come to an agreement with the conqueror to seize the territory of the other. Then they will, of course, send such of their messengers as are termed friends and recipients of salaries from two states to each other with information: ** This king (the conqueror), allied with my army, desires to seize thy territory ’• Then one of them may, with enragement and suspicion, act as before (i.e. fall upon the conqueror or the friend). The conqueror may dismiss his chief officers in charge of his forests, country parts, and army, under the pretence of their intrigue with the enemy. Then going over to the enemy, they may catch hold of him on occasions of war, siege, or any other troubles; or they may sow the seeds of dissension between the enemy and his party, corroborating the causes of dissension by producing witnesses specially tutored. Spies, disguised as hunters, may take a stand near the gate of the enemy's fort to sell flesh, and make friendship with the sentine'g at the gate. Having informed the enemy of the arrival of thieves on two or three occasions, they may prove themselves to be of reliable character and cause him to splilt his army into two divisions and to station them in two different parts of his terriWry. When his villages are being plundered or besieged, they may tell him that thieves are come very near, that the tumult is-verv great, and that a large army is required. They may take the army supplied, aud surrendering it to the commander laying waste the villages, return at night with a part of the commander’s army, and cry aloud at the gate of the fort that the thieves are slain, that the army has returned victorious,land that the gate may be opened- When the gate is opened by the watchmen under the enemy’s order or by others in confidence, they may strike the enemy with the help of the army. Paiuters, carpenters, heretics, actors, merchants, and other disguised spies belonging to the couqueror’s army may also reside inside tike tort of the enemy. Spies, disguised as agriculturists, may supply them with weapons taken in carts loaded with firewood, grass, grains, and other commodities of commerce, or disguised as images and flags of gods. Then spies, disguised as priests, may announce to the enemy, blowing their conch-shells and beating their 403 ^rums» *^at a besieging army, eager to destroy all, and armed with weapons, is coming closely behind them. Then in the 432 KAITTII.YAJS arthasastba ^npuin? tumult, they may surrender the fort gate and the towers of the fort to the army of the conqueror or disperse the enemy’s army and bring about his fall. Or taking advantage of peace and friendship with the enemy, army and weapons may be collected inside the enemy’s fort by spies disguised as iperohants, caravans, processions leading a bride, merchants selling horses, pedlars trading in miscellaneous articles, purchasers or sellers of grains, and as ascetics. These and others are the spies aiming at the life of a king. The same spies, together with those described in “ Removal of Thorns,may, by employing thieves, destroy the flock of the enemy’s cattle or merchandise in the vicinity of wild tracts. They may poison, with the juice of the madana plant, the foodstuffs And beverage kept, as previously arranged, in a definite place for the enemy s cowherds, and go opt unknown. When the cowherds show signs of intoxication in conseqnence of their eating the above foodstuffs, spies, disguised as cowherds, merchants and thieves, may fall upon the enemy’s cowherds, and carry off the cattle. »^pies, disguised as ascetics with shaved head or braided hair, and pretending to be the worshippers of god Sankarshana, may mix their sacrificial beverage with the juice of the madana plant (and give it to the cowherds), and carry off the cattle. A spy, under the guise of a vintner, may, on the occasion of procession of gods, funeral rites, festivals, and other congregations of people, go to sell liquor and present the cowherds with some liquor mixed with the juice of the madana plant. Then others may fall upon the intoxicated cowherds (and carry off the cattle). Those spies, who enter into the wild tracts of the enemv with the intention of plundering his villages, and who, leaving that work, set themselves to destroy the enemy, are termed spies under the garb of thieves. (Thus ends Chapter III, “The Work of Spies in a Siege,” in Book XIII, “ The Strategic Means to Capture a Fortress ” of the Artha^astra of Kautilya. End of the hundred and forty-third chapter from the beginning.] 1 See Book IV. KAUTILYA’S ARTHASASTRA 433 CHAPTER IV The Operation op a Siege Reduction (of the enemy) must precede a siege. The territory 404 t^Jat ^aS ^een conquered should he kept so peaceful!v that it might sleep without any fear. When it is in rebellion, it is to be pacified by bestowing rewards and remitting taxes, unless the conqueror means to quit it. Or he may select his battlefields in a remote part of the enemy’s territory, far from the populous centres; for, in the opinion of Kautilya, no territory deserves the name of a kingdom or country unless it is full of people. When a people resist the attempt of the conqueror, then he may destroy their stores, crops, and granaries, and trade. *By the destruction of trade, agricultural produce, and standing crops, by causing the people to run away, and by slaying their leaders in secret, the country will be denuded of its people. When the conqueror thinks : “ My army is provided with abun¬ dance of staple com, raw materials, machines, weapons, dress, labourers, ropes and the like, and has a favourable season to act, whereas my enemy has an unfavourable season and is suffering from disease, famine and loss of stores and defensive force, w hile his hired troops as well as the army of his friend are in a miserable condition *r — then he may begin the siege. Having well guarded his camp, transports, supplies and also the roads of communication, and having dug up a ditch and raised a rampart round his camp, he may vitiate the water in the ditches round the enemy’s fort, or empty the ditches of their winter, or fill them with water if empty, and then he may assail the rampart and the parapets by making use of underground tunnels and iron rods. If the ditch is very deep, he may fill it up with soil. If it is defended by a number of men, he may destroy it by means of machines. Horse soldiers may force their passage through the gate into the fort and smite the enemy. Now and then, in the midst of tumult he may offer terms to the enemy by taking recourse to one, two, three, or all of the strategic means. Having captured the birds, such as the vulture, crow, naptr, bhasa, parrot, maina, and pigeon, which have their nests iu the fort walls, and having tied to their tails inflammable powder (agniyoga), he inav let them fly to the forts.

Or having concealed himself in a forest after abandoning the camp, the conqueror may strike the enemy when the latter comes out. A king, pretending to be the enemy’s chief friend or ally, may make the friendship closer with the besieged, and send a messenger to say : 44 This is thy weak point; these are thy internal eoemies; that is the weak point of the besieger; and this person (who, deserting the conqueror, is now* coming to thee) is thy partisan.” When this partisan is returning with another messenger from the enemy, the conqueror should catch hold of him, and having published the partisan’s guilt, should banish him, and retire from the siege operations. Then the pretending friend may tell th# besieged : 44 Come out to help me, or let us combine and strike the besieger.” Accordingly, when the enemy comes out, he may be hemmed between the two forces (the conqueror’s force and the pretending friend’s force) and killed or captured alive to distribute his territory (between the conqueror and the friend). His capital city may be razed tsathe ground ; and the flower of his army be made to come out and be destroyed. This explains the treatment of a conquered enemy or wild chief. Either a conquered enemy or the chief of a wild tribe (in conspiracy with the conqueror) may inform the besieged : 44 With the intention of escaping from a disease, or from the attack in his weak point by his enemy in the rear, or from a rebellion in his army, the conqueror seems to be thinking of going elsewhere, abandoning the siege.” When the enemy is made to believe this, ’the conqueror may set fire to his camp and retire. Then the enemy coming out may be hemmed ... as before. Or having collected merchandise mixed with poison, the 407 con(lueror ma7 deceive the enemy by sending that mer¬ chandise to the latter. Or a pretending ally of the enemy may send a messenger to KAUTILXA’G ARTHA8A8TRA wifmy, Mkinp him: "Gome out to smite the conqueror already struck by me-' When he does so, be may be hemmed ... mi before.

This is the first way to conquer the world. In the absence of the Madhyama and neutral kings, he should, in virtue of his own excellent qualities, win the hearts of his enemy's subjects, and then direct his attention to other remote enemies. This is the second way. In the absence of a Circle of States (to be conquered), he should conquer his friend or his enemy by hemming each between his own force and that of his enemy or that of his friend respectively. This is the third way. Or he may first put down an almost invincible immediate enemy. Having doubled his power by this victory, he may go against a second enemy: having trebled his power by this victory, he may attack a third. This is the fourth way to conquer the world. Having conquered the earth with its people of distinct castes and divisions of religious life, he should enjoy it by governing it in accordance with the duties prescribed to kings. ♦Intrigue, spies, winning over the enemy's people, siege, and assault are the five means to capture a foit.

End of the hundred and forty-fourth chapter from the beginning.] CHAPTER V Restoration op Peace in a Conquered Country The expedition which the conqueror has to undertake may be of two kinds; in wild tracts or in single villages and the like. The territory which he acquires may be of three kinds: that which is newly acquired, that which is recovered (from an usurper), and that which is inherited. Having acquired a new territory, he should cover the enemy’s vices with his own virtues, and the enemy’s virtues by doubling his own virtues, by strict observance of his own duties, by attending to his works, by bestowing rewards, by remitting taxes, by giving gifts, and by bestowing honours.

The body of a man which is rubbed over with the powder of the root of bamboo (veriu) and saivala (aquatic plant), and is smeared over with the serum of the flesh of a frog, bnrns with fire. Whoever has anointed his legs with the oil extracted from the paste prepared from the roots of paribhadraka (erythrina indica), prntiluki (?), vanjula (a kind of ratan or tree), vajra (andropogon muricatum or euphorbia), and kadali (banana), mixed with theserutn of the flesh of a frog, can walk over fire (without hurt). •Oil should be extracted from the paste prepared from the roots of pratibala, vanjula and piribhadraka, all growing near water, the pa-te being mixed with the serum of the flesh of a frog. Having anointed ones legs with this oil, one can walk over a white-hot mass of fire as though on a bed of roses. W ben birds such ns a liamsa (swan), kranficha (heron), maytlra 417 (peacock), and other large swimming birds are let to fly at nisht with a burning reed attached to their tail, it presents the appearance of a fire-brand falling from the sky (ulka). Ashes caused by lightning quench the fire. W hen, in a fireplace, kidney beans (mssha) wetted with the menstrual fluid of a woman, as well as the roots of vajra (andropogon muricatum) and kadali (banana), wetted with the serum of the flesh of a frog are kept, no grains can be cooked there. Cleansing the fireplace is its remedy. By keeping in the mouth a ball-like piece of pilu (careya arborea) or a knot of the root of linseed tree (suvarchala) with fire inserted within the mass of the ball and wound round with threads and cotton (pichu), volumes of smoke and fire can be breathed out. When the oil extracted from the fruits of ku<a (ficus religiosa) and amra (mango) is poured over the fire, it burns even in the storm. Sea-foam wetted with oil and ignited keeps burning when floating on water. The fire generated by churning the bone of a monkev by means of a bamboo stick of white and black colour (kalmishavepu) burns in water instead of being quenched. There will burn no other fire where the fire generated by churn¬ ing, by means of a bamboo stick of white and black colonr, the left side rib-bone of a man killed by a weapon or put to the gallows: or the fire generated by churning the bone of a man or woman by KAUTILYA'S ARTHASASTRA 449 means of the bone of another man is circumambulated thrice from right to left. ♦When the paste prepared from the animals, such as chuchundari (musk rat), khanjarita (?), and kharakita (?), with the urine of a horse is applied to the chains with which the legs of a man are bound, they will be broken to pieces. The sun-stone (ayaskanta) or any other stone (will break to pieces) when wetted with the serum of the flesh of the animals kulinda (?), and dardura (?), kharakita l?). The paste prepared from the powder of the rib-bone of naraka (?), a donkey,kanka (a kind of vulture), and bhasa (a bird), mixed with the juice of water-lily, is applied to the legs of bipeds and quadrupeds (while making a journey). When a man makes a journey, wearing the shoes made of the skin of a camel, smeared over with the serum of the flesh of an owl and a vulture and covered over with the leaves of the banyan tree, he can walk fifty yojanas without any fatigue. (When the shoes are smeared over with) the pith, inarrow or sperm of the birds, syena, kanka, kaka grdhra, hamsa, krauncha, and vichiralla (the traveller wearing them) can walk a hundred yojanas (without any fatigue). The fat or serum derived from roasting a pregnant camel together with saptaparna (lechites scholaris), or from roasting dead children in cremation grounds, is applied to render a journey of a hundred yojanas easy. ♦Terror should be caused to the enemy by exhibiting these and other wonderful and delusive performances; while anger causing terror is common to all, terrification by such wonders is held as a means to consolidate peace.

It follows from this that no one should seek the favour of a king through the medium of the king's enemies. When the statement of a reason is equally applicable to two kinds of circumstances, it is termed doubt; for example : “ Which of the two should a conqueror march against : one whose subjects are impoverished and greedy, or one whose subjects are oppressed ? ** * When the nature of procedure to be specified in connection ^ with a thing is said to be equal to what has already been specified in connection with another, it is termed reference to similar procedure ; for example : “ On the lands allotted to him for the purpose of carrying on agricultural operations, he should do as before.**4 The inference of a reverse statement from a positive statement is termed contrariety; for example : 4* The reverse will be the appearance of a king w ho is not pleased with the messenger/*J The portion of a sentence which is omitted, though necessary to convey a complete sense, is ellipsis; for example* *4 With his feathers plucked off, he will lose his power to move.*** Here 44 like a bird ” is omitted. W'hen the opinion of another person is stated, but not refuted, it is acceptance of that opinion; for example : 44 Wings, front, and reserve, is the form of an array of the army according to the school of Usanas.”: Description in detail is explanation; for example: 44 Especially amongst assemblies and confederacies of kings possessing the characteristics of assemblies, quarrel is due to gambling; and » Chapter I, Book II. * Chapter IV, Book V. * Chapter V, Book VI. 4 Chapter XI, Book I. » Chapter XVI, Book I. • Chapter I, Book VIII. 1 Chapter VI, Book X. 462 KAUTILY.VS ARTHASASTRA destruction of persons due to the quarrel. Hence, among evil propensities, gambling is the worst evil, since it renders the ting powerless for activity.0 1 Stating the derivative sense of a word is derivation; for example: ‘ That which throws off (vyasvati) a king from his prosperous career is propensity (vyasana).” * The mentioning of a fact to illustrate a statement is illustration ; for example : “ In war with a superior, the inferior will be reduced to the same condition as that of a foot-soldier fighting with an elephant.” 5 Removal of an undesired implication from a statement is exception ; for example: "A king may allow his enemy’s army to be present close to his territory, unless he suspects of the existence of any internal trouble.” * Words which are not used by others in the special sense in 430 Wiuch tbey are used by tbe author are his own technical terms; for example: “ He who is close to the conqueror’s territory is the first member; next to him comes the second member; and next to the second comes the third.” '* f he citation of another’s opinion to be refuted is prima facie view; lor example : “ Of the two evils, the distress of the king and that of his minister, the latter is worse.”* Settled opinion is rejoinder; for example: " The distress of t e ing is worse, since everything depends upon him : for tbe king is the central pivot, as it were.”' That which is universal in its application is conclusion or an established fact; for example: “ A king should ever be ready for Drawing attention to a later chapter is reference to a subsequent portion; for example: “ We shall explain balance and weights in e chapter, The Superintendent of Weights and Measures.’ The statement that it has been already 'spoken of is reference to a previous portion; for example : “ The qualifications of a minister have already been described.”'* lhus and not otherwise ” is command ; for example: Hence ' Chapter III, Book VIII, * Chapter I, Book VIII. * Chapter II, Book IX. • Chapter I, Book VIII. • Chapter XIX, Book I. “ Chapter I, Book VI. * Chapter III, Book VII. ‘ Chapter II, Book VI. ’ Chapter I, Book VIII. * Chapter X, Book II.

[Thus ends Chapter I, ” Paragraphic Divisions of the Treatise,” in the Fifteenth Book, “ Plan of Treatise.” This is the one hundred and fiftieth chapter from the first chapter of the entire work. The Fifteenth Book, “ Plan of Treatise ” of the Arthasustra of Kautilya, is thus brought to a close. ♦Having seen discrepancies in many ways on the part of the writers of commentaries on the Sastras, Vishpu Gupta himself has made (this) Sutra and commentary.] * Chapter XVII, Book t. • Chapter VII, Book III. 1 Chapter IV, Book III, • Chapter XVI, Book III. # • '> il * »'i-l ' trflf Ir £ ' I •' J 1- ' - ■ I n APPENDIX OPINIONS OF KMISGNT ORIENTAL SCHOLARS OS THE lHFORTANO* OF THE ahtbasAstba Dr* F, W.

Jolly says: I must say that this is one of the most interesting and valuable Sanskrit works ever procured. As a faithful and life-like representa¬ tion of Indian institutions and modes of government, it is without a parallel. It throws a great deal of new light on Indian constitutional history, and on the development of Indian law. You mav be sincerely congratulated on having undertaken this important work and conducted it thus far. . . Dr. L. D. Barnett, Professor of Sanskrit, University College, London, writes, in a letter dated 7th September, 1909, addressing the translator: . . . The latter (the Arthasastra) is evidently a work of the highest importance for the study of Indian history and law. and I gladly offer my tribute of admiration for the industry and skill with which you have approached the task of translating it. . .

The Mandala theory has been used since ancient India. Various major kingdoms in Southeast Asia, including in the Nusantara, also use it even to be implemented in the defense system, embodied in their geopolitics and geostrategy. By some authors, Mandala Theory is still considered traditional and military heavy. But in fact, this theory is inseparable from other defense concepts such as diplomacy (The concept of Mantrashakti, Ṣāḍguṇya, and Cautr Upaya) which are the strength of a state. This qualitative study is using critical discourse analysis and Gadamer's hermeneutics. Mandala's theory as a defense concept in Chanakya's view was explored from several major theories in Arthaśāstra and its implementation in Indonesian geopolitics and geostrategy. However, the current defense needs to be adjusted, especially regarding the involvement of non-military elements, to build a strong state. Therefore, national defense theory should not only understood by state administrators. But also the intellectual cadre of state defense, and even all of its people. Keywords: Defense, Chanakya; Arthaśāstra; Mandala Theory; Geopolitics; Geostrategic INTRODUCTION The Mandala theory, as a concept of state defense, has been used by several Ancient kingdoms in India as in the Maurya Kingdom. The popularity of the teachings of the Maharsi Cāṇakya spread to Southeast Asia and is widely used in the major kingdoms of Southeast Asia as a heavy military concept of national defense. This ancient theory was also adapted by various countries, including Indonesia, with adjustments to modern defense patterns. This theory, if used appropriately, will be able to mature Indonesia's geopolitics and geostrategy in realizing the integrity of the Unitary State of the Republic of Indonesia. The Mandala Theory is one of the essential topics in the text, which is the Magnum Opus of Cāṇakya or Kautilya titled Arthaśāstra. Arthaśāstra was compiled by Cāṇakya based on some ancient Hindu political books, political traditions, and life experiences. Arthasashtra consists of 32 parts, 15 adikarana with 150 chapters, and 6000 slokas (Chati et al., 2018). Thus Arthaśāstra can also be said as a compendium to manage a country in a complete and detailed way. For this monumental work, Cāṇakya is considered a legendary Hindu political figure, so his genius is often equated with western philosophers and statesmen such as Plato, Aristotle, Jurnal Penelitian Agama Hindu. 180 and Machiavelli (Rangarajan, 1992). Although in fact, the thoughts and works of Cāṇakya cannot be compared to the figures in the world afterward. More in-depth study and interpretation make Arthaśāstra find its relevance amid the very rapid development of defense science in this modern era. Cāṇakya's thoughts in Arthaśāstra if literally interpreted, may look outdated and irrelevant. For example, regarding the theory of Mandala, Western thinkers only emphasize that "every neighboring country is an enemy (source of threat), and the enemy of your enemy is your friend" (Rangarajan, 1992). If seen only from this perspective, the Cāṇakya mandala theory seems "realist heavy" and difficult to apply at present. This perspective is in contradiction with the regionalism regime, which indirectly demands neighboring countries to cooperate for a common goal. Even today, it will be difficult for a country to show hostile conditions directly and openly with its neighboring countries. It is infrequent even today. However, if we read the Cāṇakya's work comprehensively, the theories that he came up with could be implemented at different times with several more profound and brilliant interpretations. Likewise, in modern geopolitics and geostrategy, the theory of Mandala continues to find its relevance and can strengthen the national defense system. METHODS This article is the result of qualitative research with data analysis using content analysis. The steps of data collection follow a pattern (Creswell, 2010), namely observation and interviews, whether in the form of structured or not, documentation, visual materials, and efforts to design protocols for taking notes or recording information. This study is an attempt to find a common thread between the text of national defense contained in Arthaśāstra. This includes the concepts of geopolitics and geostrategy, threat mapping, statecraft, and diplomacy (relations between countries) with the context of the embodiment of the national defense system. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Mandala theory as a concept of national defense has given influence to the significant kingdoms in Southeast Asia, and some modern countries adapted the memory of this theory. Major Abhishek Kumar(2016), through its work, titled "The Arthaśāstra: Assessing the Contemporary Relevance of an Ancient Indian Treatise on Statescaft" states the Priority of the Cāṇakya for elements of the national power of the country and its focus on increasing state power, finding common ground in contemporary Chinese policy choices. This paper also describes Chinese contemporary geopolitical environmental analysis in the Kautilya doctrine. In this paper, it was revealed that the concept of Kautilya was also found in China's geopolitical system. Breena Coates and Col. Jeffrey Caton, through its work, entitle "The Ultimate Pragmatist: Kautilya's Philosophy on SMART Power in National Security" states that Kautilya's idea supports the combination of smart power with diplomacy and opportunism. Furthermore, Raja Mandala's theory is a model in which the king/state leader can decide between cooperation, collusion, alliance, acquisition, or destruction in dealing with other countries. This paper explains Arthaśāstra with soft power, and also hard power. "Mandala," "Segmentary State" And Politics Of Centralization In Medieval Ayudhya was written by Sunait Chutintaranond, explaining about the use of mandalas in Southeast Asia in the Middle Ages. In his writings, he described how the pattern of a ring built by a king to strengthen his position while expanding the territory of his kingdom. Competition between kingdoms is the trigger for a ruler to reinforce his mandala position. The geopolitical dimension appears in an unstable circle. But in his conclusion, he emphasized that Ayudhya was a state; in his Mandala, there were small kingdoms. They were, to this extent, "little kings" in the vast but loosely integrated territories of the Ayudhya kings (Chutintaranond, 1990). Jurnal Penelitian Agama Hindu. 181 The article entitled Mandala: From Sacred Origins to Sovereign Affairs in Traditional Southeast Asia (2019), written by Rosita Dellios, examines 'mandala' as a tradition of Knowledge in Southeast Asia. A doctrine of traditional Southeast Asian 'international relations' derived from ancient Indian political discourse. It also highlights the value of Chinese thought as the 'yin' to ancient India's 'yang' in the construction of a Southeast Asian mandalic political culture (Dellios, 2003). The writers above have a similar view that the ancient Cāṇakya theory that was implemented in the past in various kingdoms can still be adapted to the modern life of the present state. It was stated that each country changed several important Cāṇakya teachings differently. However, this study is essential because no one has specifically discussed the theory of Mandala concerning Indonesian geopolitics and geostrategy. The Mandala Theory is one of the crucial doctrines in the ancient book on state administration, Arthaśāstra. This compendium of treatises is written by Cāṇakya or Kautilya, during the Mauryan Empire. Arthaśāstra means śāstra (science) of artha (wealth or territory with the human population). However, Arthaśāstra stated not only "the science of wealth" but also "political science" or "the science of government" (Sil, 1985: 102) in (Surpi, 2019a). Kautilya's Arthashastra is a very comprehensive treatise on governance in a monarchical Vedic state (Darnal, n.d.). This very comprehensive treatise discusses various matters related to state administration, including foreign policy. Besides, the essence provides education to state authorities on how to achieve the country's national goals, such as expanding the influence of its kingdom. Cāṇakya or Kautilya as the author of this treatise, is a prime minister and chief political adviser to King Chandragupta and his son, Bindusara, in the Maurya Kingdom. The manuscript compiled around 300 BC contains a foreign policy doctrine related to the desire of an ambitious king to become a conqueror/ruler of the plains of India (Karad, 2015). Cāṇakya composed Arthaśāstra against the background of an anarchic international system. A condition where there is no existence of higher supremacy above the state. During the Chandragupta dynasty, what was developed as a view of realism, which promoted self-help, the country's efforts to continue to accumulate power so that the country's sustainability was maintained. The belief that develops between countries is that there are only two choices, whether to conquer or be conquered. The development of a country's power or growth can occur when the state successfully acquires the territory of its neighboring kingdoms or other kingdoms. Arthaśāstra is divided into three major parts. The first part deals with the administration of a country. This section describes the organizations that exist within a country. Like for example, what are the duties and responsibilities of each significant state official, whether it is in the form of efforts to maintain order or collect revenue for the country. The second part deals with the code of law and justice. This section includes an explanation of civil and criminal law as well as law enforcement efforts. Meanwhile, the third part deals with a foreign policy whose primary purpose is the acquisition of territory through conquest (Vittal, 2011). The three sections refer to the three goals of the state, namely wealth/welfare (economy), justice (law and order), and growth (expansion of territory/power). Arthaśāstra was compiled based on several ancient Hindu political books, political traditions, and life experiences. Chanakya The work consists of 32 parts, 15 adikarana (book) with 150 chapters, 180 Prakarana (section devoted to a specific topic), and 6000 slokas (Chati et al., 2018). Adhikarana (book) first discusses the King, the training that must be passed by the King, the procedure for appointing ministers and state officials, security, and state safety. The second Adhikarana explained the tasks that must be carried out by state executive officials. In the seventh Adhikarana Chanakya outlines the mandala theory, the state's circle (Raj Mandala Theory / the circle of state theory) and also the theory of six foreign policy (Ṣāḍguṇya / Six fold Foreign Policy) that can be used in various situations. These theories are used to achieve the final goal that has been set, namely, to ensure the welfare of the country (Rangarajan, 1992). Jurnal Penelitian Agama Hindu. 182 Associated with the defense of a country, in the eleventh, Adhikarana discusses how Vijigīṣu (leader of a country that has a passion for conquering) should be able to beat samghas or oligarchy governed by a group leader. While the thirteenth Adhikarana discusses the procedures for conquering the fortified capital of the enemy country either by relying on reason/pretext/negotiation (diplomacy) or through fighting (fighting), this section also discusses how to govern the conquered territories. Meanwhile, at the fourteenth Adhikarana, Cāṇakya discusses the secret methods that can be used to destroy enemy forces, ranging from medicine to occult methods. Then in the fifteenth Adhikarana Cāṇakya revealed an explanation of 32 types of tantrayukti or methods for treating the subject, the tools used in science- processing (Astana, Made, 2015). In Arthaśāstra, Cāṇakya outlines in detail the ways and methods to build a country and preserve its power in a strategically competitive environment and in adversarial power with the inherent danger of political subversion and social instability (Avalokitesvari et al., 2018). Meanwhile, the threat was discussed at the eighth Adhikarana. Cāṇakya refers to disaster or threat by the term vyasana. This source of disaster or threat can come from within the country or abroad. The threat from within the country including the rebellions, famines, plagues, epidemics, internal strife, decadence ruler, merchant/officials are dishonest (corrupt), economic problems, treachery committed by state officials (ministers / high state officials), famine, drought, natural disasters (floods, forest fires), and domestic crime (robbery, theft). While disasters from outside the country can be in the form of enemy efforts to conquer/invade the vijigīṣu / state, defected allies, and infiltrate agents from foreign countries into the country (Astana, Made, 2015). In Cāṇakya's view, the most potential external threat is from a country that borders directly with his country. Thus it can be said that the neighboring country is the most potent enemy where the highest external threat to the country comes from this neighboring country. Mapping threats, especially threats from outside the country, is described in the theory of Mandala. The geographical position of a neighboring state is immediately categorized as a natural and most potential enemy. Then every country that is allied with the neighboring country will also be classified as an enemy (Gonda & Kangle, 1967). On the other hand, enemies from neighboring countries should be invited to work together because they are categorized as friends. The simple language is "the enemy of your enemy is a friend, and the friend of your enemy is an enemy." Mandala Theory – The Circle of State Theory, escribes the geopolitical constellation of a country. his Mandala theory includes at least 12 state categories in the circle of a state. First, vijigīṣu, the would-be conqueror. Second, ari, the main enemy of the vijigīṣu. Third, mitra, the vijigīṣu's ally. Fourth, arimitra the ally of the enemy. Fifth, mitramitra, the friend of the ally. Sixth, arimitramitra or the ally of an enemy's friend. Seventh, parsnigraha, or enemy in the rear of the vijigīṣu. Eighth, akranda, or the vijigīṣu's ally in the rear. Ninth, parsnigrahasara, or the ally of parsnigraha. Tenth, akrandasara, or the ally of akranda. Eleventh, madhyama, or the middle King, which bordering both vijigīṣu and the ari or the middle power country. Meanwhile, the twelfth, udasina a country which is lying outside, indifferent/ neutral, more powerful than vijigīṣu, ari, and madhyami, or the major power state (Kangle, 1986). The description of the geopolitical constellation in the mandala theory can be seen from the illustration in the following figure. Jurnal Penelitian Agama Hindu. 183 Figure 1. Geopolitical Constellation in Mandala Theory Source: Vittal, 2011 This geopolitical constellation is more a symbolic form and a form of confidence built by a country. It is possible to form overlapping mandalas between one kingdom and another. In this geopolitical constellation, not necessarily the vijigīṣu or the state which intends to conquer becomes the center of other countries literally. This geographical constellation is dynamic, where neighboring countries may be hostile, friendly, or vassal (subordinate) (Gonda & Kangle, 1967). This state was confirmed by R.P Kangle (1986), that Cāṇakya did not hit all the neighboring countries as enemies. This is discussed in the seventh Adhikarana, chapter 18 of the 29th sutra, that: The princes of neighboring countries, samantas, are usually considered hostile. But it is possible that some of them may have friendly feelings towards vijigīṣu (conquering states), while others may even submit to it. Neighboring countries fall into three categories; aribhavin (from hostile dispositions), mitrabhavin (from friendly dispositions), and bhrytyabhavin (from brotherly dispositions) (Kangle, 1986). It is justified that the categorization of this country is based on several things such as actions/behaviors shown by neighboring countries towards vijigīṣu, shared goals to be achieved, differences in interests, the political content of the neighboring country's alliance with other countries and so forth. Furthermore, in Cāṇakya's view, neighboring countries are naturally seen as potential enemies, but not necessarily all neighboring countries are enemies. If the neighboring country always shows opposing attitudes and policies and is detrimental to the vijigīṣu and even has the potential to threaten, then the neighboring country is categorized as aribhavin. Meanwhile, if the neighboring country cooperates with the vijigīṣu, it does a lot of mutually beneficial cooperation with one another, has a shared vision of regional security and peace. The neighboring country is not an enemy but as a partner or mitrabhavin. More in-depth analysis shows that the theory of the Mandala is one of the bases in running a foreign policy that is run during the Maurya dynasty under the supervision of Acharya Chanakya. Mandala theory, as explained in the above description, is a geopolitical constellation of countries that coexist with the vijigīṣu state. This theory states that potential threats emerge from countries that border directly or neighboring countries. In carrying out its foreign policy, Jurnal Penelitian Agama Hindu. 184 Cāṇakya always reminds the Maurya dynasty government to be guided by this theory in determining the position of the country, which will be invited to cooperate or be conquered. After determining the position of the targeted country, the next step is what policy will be taken to deal with that country, namely ṣāḍguṇya or six-fold foreign policy. Next, it was decided what efforts would be considered as an integral part of the foreign policy (catur upaya), whether the sama, dama, bedha, or danda. This constellation is widely spread along with the growth of various kingdoms in Southeast Asia. (Chutintaranond, 1990) has written about the mandala pattern used by the Ayudhya kingdom, which was used as a form of state defense. This theory has been able to build the kingdom of Ayudhya to be significant and influential. (Boesche, 2003) said the constitutional structures of the Southeast Asian international society were primarily derived from ancient Indian political discourse based on the book of Arthaśāstra by Mauryan Chief Minister, Kautilya, in the 4th Century. Furthermore, Kautilya's concept, the Mandala, was then adopted by Wolters (1968) to denote pre-colonial Southeast Asian political formations. Southeast Asian polities did not conform to the Chinese view as the polity defined by its centre rather than its boundaries, and it could be composed of numerous other tributary polities without undergoing administrative integration (Dellios, 2003). Mandala theory is the plan, the blueprint of the expedition with the intention of world conquest because Kautilya believes in strength and power. For him, "Power is the possession of strength," and it is in three forms: 1) Mantrashakti: the power of Knowledge, i.e., power of counsel; 2) Prabhu Shakti: Power of might, i.e., the power of treasury and army; and 3) Utsaha shakti: the power of energy, i.e., the power of bravery. Likewise, success is also threefold. By this theory, Kautilya indicated towards reality and made alert to the King to be a conqueror or suffer conquest. All his discussion is revolving around the desire of victory over the enemy and world conquest to establish unified, sovereign world empire that is the concept of Chakravarti – imperatively the Indian territories in between the Himalaya and the sea. Moreover, this theory provides a Geostrategic analysis of interstate relations. Therefore, it is the theory of geopolitics (Karad, 2015). The application of the Mandala geopolitical theory, as explained by Cāṇakya in Arthaśāstra is also widely used in the Classical Southeast Asian Era. For instance, the Srivijaya period and the Golden Age of the Majapahit Kingdom with an area of power that stretches from the island of Sumatra to New Guinea, which covers the territories of Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, Brunei, Southern Thailand, the Philippines and East Timor at present (Manggala, 2013). Under the leadership of Supreme Minister Gajah Mada and the Charismatic Leadership of King Hayam Wuruk, the Majapahit Kingdom formed a geopolitical mandala by placing the surrounding kingdoms in concentric circles with Majapahit as the center of its circle (chakravartin). Foreign relations established by Majapahit refer to the Geopolitical Mandala, which places several countries as Mitra (friends/allies), ari (opponents/enemies), madhyama (middle power), and udasina (significant power). The Majapahit Geopolitical Mandala concentric circles can be described as follows. Jurnal Penelitian Agama Hindu. 185 Figure 2. Mandala Geopolitik Majapahit Source: Adapted from (Manggala, 2013) Majapahit put Champa as the rear friend. This constellation is based on Champa's position, which at the time rejected the Mongol hegemony in the region. Champa even rejected Mongol's request to use one of the ports in Champa as a place of embarking logistics when Kublai Khan launched a massive invasion of Java at the end of the 13th Century. On the other hand, Majapahit established a relationship with the Syangka kingdom because they both rejected the dominance of the Chola kingdom from the Indian sub-continent. This relationship is also based on the Chanakya doctrine "my enemy's enemy is my friend." The Syangka kingdom is an enemy of the Chola kingdom. Because Majapahit was also hostile to the Chola kingdom, Syangka as an enemy of the Chola kingdom was a Mitra or partner who was worthy of cooperation. These relationships show how Majapahit manifested the balance of its influence by establishing a relationship with the kingdom, which considered capable of reducing the hegemony of their enemy. Majapahit tried to ensure that its ari (enemy), the work of the Mongols and Cholas, was balanced by its Mitra (allies), the kingdoms of Champa, and Syangka. Meanwhile according to (Muljana, Slamet, 979), Majapahit also built and maintained relations with Ayudhya because Ayudhya had created a population and had power in the Central Indochina Peninsula, which previously had no record of the influence of relations with the Majapahit kingdom. Majapahit placed Ayudhya as Madhyama (Middle Power). Meanwhile, Majapahit placed China, which was then under the Ming Dynasty empire, as Udasina or Major Power. Majapahit established trade relations with the Ming Dynasty to build a desired regional architecture. However, it was never under the control of Chinese influence. Majapahit formed a strategic partnership with China. Through this relationship, Majapahit established regional stability based on mutually beneficial economic cooperation, without having to submit politically to the Ming Dynasty in China. In the 15th poem Nagarakretagama, Majapahit mentions Campa, Cambodia, and Yawana are friendly countries (Mitreka Satata). The important thing to understand in the constellation of geopolitical mandalas in Southeast Asia in the classical era, including in the golden age of Majapahit, was its international system that did not refer to the tributary system that was run by the empire in China. Countries that recognized the Majapahit authority paid several annual tributes and thus were under the "protection" of the Majapahit Kingdom. But they were given flexibility in Jurnal Penelitian Agama Hindu. 186 running their government as usual. There was no significant interference from Majapahit on the running of government in the kingdom. In other words, the kingdoms under the protection of Majapahit had autonomy over their respective territories. Another diplomatic approach used by Majapahit is to build alliances through marriages between royal families. The Mandala Geopolitical Constellation used by the Majapahit Kingdom still shows a pattern that is almost similar to the constellation used by the Maurya Dynasty in India when Kautilya served as Prime Minister and principal adviser to the kingdom. There are clear definitions of partners (allies/friends), as well as definitions of the kingdom which are stated as ari (opponents/enemies/rivals), madhyama (middle Power), and Udasina (significant power). The position of the international system, which also still adopted an anarchic order, made the existing kingdom at that time need to form an alliance of cooperation to get protection from other kingdoms that were bigger and stronger in power. Meanwhile, this massive empire needs to continue to strengthen itself and preserve its power. The geopolitical constellation of the Mandala used by the Mauryan Kingdom was aimed at realizing the ambition of the Supreme Minister Kautilya to unite all the kingdoms in the Indian subcontinent under the Mauryan kingdom. Meanwhile the Majapahit Kingdom's Mandala Geopolitical Constellation is aimed at fulfilling Gajah Mada's ambition to unite the kingdoms in the archipelago and surrounding areas under the rule of the Majapahit Kingdom. Most of the scholars remember Vigraha (war/invasion / hard power) as a method used in perpetuating power and carrying out foreign policy in the constellation of geopolitical mandalas. In contrast, Vigraha or war/invasion / hard power is only one of several approaches outlined by Kautilya. Another approach is to use the diplomacy method more. Like for example, it is achieving peace through a peace agreement / Cooperation (samdhi), conducting diplomacy to form an alliance or seeking support (samsraya), or being quiet/neutral (asanas). The Geopolitics of Majapahit kingdom run its Mandala, which focuses on cooperation between the kingdom, including trade cooperation. The mandala concentric circle constellation can still be seen today in the foreign relations of Indonesia and other ASEAN countries. Even so, it cannot be denied that the changing times and the international political system have changed the pattern of approaches used in carrying out the mandala geopolitical constellation. At present, the mandala constellation in the form of concentric circles will mostly form a priority circle of cooperation between countries. It is because international norms make the state no longer able to declare other countries as enemies or rivals openly and freely. Besides, there is no longer any attack using hard power, which makes a country must seek alliances to obtain protection. The mandala concentric circle constellation of Indonesia's foreign cooperation places ASEAN as its first concentric circle. The next concentric circle is filled with cooperative relations with significant power countries and other countries that have a common goal or interest with Indonesia. This concentric circle is also apparent in the regional architecture of the cooperation carried out by ASEAN. Strategic groupings are carried out to form cooperation with other countries outside ASEAN, such as ASEAN + 1, ASEAN + 3, ASEAN + 6, and even East Asia Summit. ASEAN Plus One (dialogue partners), which consists of 6 (six) countries, namely China, Japan, Korea, India, Australia, and New Zealand, focuses on trade liberalization and regional comprehensive economic cooperation. ASEAN Plus Three (APT) began to be formed since 1997, involving three East Asian countries, namely China, Japan, and Korea. APT cooperation is based on the Joint Statement on East Asia. Today, the mandala theory is also implemented in the concept of Indonesia's defense in geopolitics and geostrategy. The term geopolitics is used in a variety of contexts, as far as it is concerned with the political significance of geography and the strategic construction of countries towards geographic development (geostrategic). In geopolitical theories, geography is believed to be the dominant factor influencing the identity, behavior, and interaction of a country (Anggoro, 2017). Geostrategy is the formulation of a national strategy to take into Jurnal Penelitian Agama Hindu. 187 account the geographical conditions and the constellation as a major factor. In formulating geostrategy, it is necessary to pay attention to various internal and external factors that will influence it. For instance, the geography, demography, natural resources, ideology, politics, economics, social culture, and defense and security, in addition to other factors such as global and regional conditions (Mulyono, 2017). Thus geostrategy is the formulation of a national strategy by taking into account the circumstances and constellation of geography as its main factors. In general, the view of geopolitics gives rise to two streams of power, firstly focusing on forces on land (continental) and secondly, focusing on strength in the sea (maritime). The Maurya Kingdom, setting its mandate focused on continental power, while Srivijaya and Majapahit focused more on sea power. However, in the past and present, the frontier region must receive attention in efforts to build a strong defense system. Just like in the past, Indonesia must pay close attention to the frontier region, which is the territory of the Republic of Indonesia's geography, which is located directly adjacent to neighboring countries. As a maritime country, Indonesia has recently strengthened geopolitics and geostrategy by paying attention to the sea area. This is demonstrated by Indonesia's response to geopolitical dynamics in the Indo-Pacific, where Indonesia's geographical position is right in the middle of the Indo- Pacific, with the originating of the Global Maritime Fulcrum (GMF). The Global Maritime Fulcrum is placed as geopolitics, a geographical director of a country's foreign policy which places the sea as an important dimension of the Global Maritime Fulcrum, a concept presented by President Jokowi at the East Asia Summit, in Naypyidaw Myanmar on November 13, 2014. While Japan and India first launched the concept of Confluence of the Two Seas in 2007, followed by the United States with Rebalancing toward Asia in 2011, and China with the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road in 2013. The four major powers competed in the Indo-Pacific region.(Yani & Montratama, 2018). This great program is ideal and strategic, considering that history shows that the Kingdom of Srivijaya and the Kingdom of Majapahit enjoyed its glory by mastering the route of service between China and India. China and India were great powers in the days of Srivijaya and Majapahit. Five major powers (US, China, India, Japan, and Australia) have a large interest and try to secure in terms of shipping routes, market access, and access to resources in the Indo-Pacific region. Indonesia's position is right in the middle of the Indo-Pacific, which must be utilized as well as possible for the greatness of the Indonesian people. China is dealing with the US, India, Japan, and Australia. Indonesia's position to face a competition between these two great powers is not easy. On the one hand, Indonesia wants to continue to maintain positive relations with China, especially because Indonesia wants investment from China to improve infrastructure and also strengthen domestic industries that can open jobs. On the other hand, Indonesia also realized that China could have great potential to create instability in Southeast Asia, especially as a threat to ASEAN unity. Since a long time ago, Kauṭilya Pandit, in his treatise Arthaśāstra has taught how political power must be attained and maintained but must not neglect the welfare of society, including its moral quality and way of thinking. Politics is dedicated to the welfare of society, not to destroy the nation's fundamentals, which are composed of morality and unity. Cāṇakya and Machiavelli are two camps of political thinkers of different eras and different lands. Still, the teachings have a common thread, even though they are disguised in the fabric of political morality to build virtue in the midst of society. (Surpi, 2019a). Indonesia now and in the future, must be awakened with intelligence and unity. More and more ancient Knowledge should be able to be read, constructed, and contributed to the thinking of national defense. In addition, more and more young people must learn Knowledge about national defense and also become national defense cadres (Surpi, 2019b). The Mandala theory formulated by Kautilya was used as a concept of national defense during the Chandragupta Maurya period. The concept was adopted by several major kingdoms Jurnal Penelitian Agama Hindu. 188 in Southeast Asia, such as Ayudhya (Ayodhya, Ayutthaya) and Majapahit. The two big empires use the concept of Kautilya as the primary form of their geopolitical and geostrategic constellations. As a theory that is widely known and used in ancient kingdoms, the mandala theory was also adapted in defense of the Republic of Indonesia to strengthen Indonesia's position in Asia and the world (Surpi et al., 2019). The implementation of Mandala Theory today is more concentric circles that are cooperating within the ASEAN Region. For then, it is enlarged for the sake of economic strength and cooperation in other fields. Today, no country can openly declare itself hostile to a certain country. But that does not mean there will be no problems that arise. Competition continues to occur even when there is a conflict of interest. Indonesia's relations with neighboring countries often experience ups and downs and dynamics from time to time. The strategy must continue to be changed following global developments and chess games carried out by many large countries, which often harm other countries. How should Indonesia continue to map geopolitics and work on geostrategy to face regional and even global divisions that have different interests? Moreover, the political constellation is not only a concept as outlined in a white paper but also requires the ability of its people to understand, design, and run geostrategy to succeed above the many global competition and rules. Indonesia's foreign policy, which is Assocoative Diplomacy, always strives to develop significant relationships in cooperation with other countries, outside transactional interests and routine relations. ASEAN is like a yard and must continue to be improved, and Indonesia can go beyond Asia. Nevertheless, Indonesia and some countries in the inner circle are not without problems. Indonesia and Australia, despite close ties, have experienced several tensions that have resulted in the closure of the embassy office. Indonesia and Australia have sensitive zones to discuss, namely about West Papua. The convergence of so many dividing factors into this single issue would suggest that West Papua will continue as a significant test for the relationship (Day, 2015). The existence of Australia, which provides asylum for citizens who demand independence, has disturbed the excellent relations of Indonesia and Australia on many occasions. Another example is the relationship between Indonesia and Malaysia, an allied country that is sometimes at odds. During the Sukarno administration, relations between Indonesia and Malaysia were marked by tension, which in the following period was the normalization and efforts to reduce conflict during the Suharto era. Indonesia's relations with Malaysia drifted apart in the 1990s when there was an Indonesian military training facility for Singapore that was considered a threat by Malaysia, a suspended sentence given to an Indonesian citizen in Sabah, to the disputes on the islands of Sipadan and Ligitan. Tensions between Jakarta and Beijing illustrate how problems arose with neighboring countries, followed by various other issues. For example the abduction of Indonesian citizens in the Sulu Sea, piracy in the Malacca Strait, smuggling of weapons, narcotics, and humans through the Andaman Sea, to the issue of naval power competitions among maritime countries such as the United States, India, Russia, and of course China in the Indo-Pacific (Manurung, 2018). Various events often test Indonesian sovereignty. Therefore, in addition to the formulation of national defense, including geopolitics and geostrategy, qualified human resources are needed to execute the strategy brilliantly. The future of Indonesia will be determined by the concepts of geopolitics and geostrategy that are implemented. All children of the nation must master geopolitics and geostrategy well. Because in the future, the glory of a country is determined to what extent the attitude of heroism and nationalism of its people. The national defense system is often sinister by many because it is considered weak. Indonesian territorial disputes often succumb to ASEAN's unity. This can be an indication that Indonesia's Mandala must be strengthened through strengthening geopolitics and geostrategy and carried out carefully. Jurnal Penelitian Agama Hindu. 189 CONCLUSION Mandala theory has been widely applied as a state defense and political concept in ancient India, the great kingdoms of Southeast Asia, and the famous Majapahit Mandala. In modern times, several countries in Southeast Asia adapted this mandala theory in their geopolitics and geostrategy. Today, modern states do not explicitly determine who their enemies are. However, there are competition, trade wars, and attempts to dominate. Indonesia must continue to mature its Mandala, in the sense of adaptation efforts that are adapted to the present context. Able to deal with neighbors who are often involved in the feud because of differences in interests and alliances of the interests of large countries. Indonesia must always mature its geopolitics and geostrategies to build an established national defense and be able to continue to strengthen the country and increase its prosperity in the politics of world regulation. The mandala theory, built by Kautilya or Cāṇakya, was used extensively to create the Maurya kingdom, and the Knowledge was written in his famous treatise, Arthaśāstra. For the future of Indonesia, mandala theory must strengthen the concepts of geopolitics and geostrategy. Likewise, other theories in Arthaśāstra should be used to enrich the defense and management of the state. The involvement of an intellectual cadre of state defense in Indonesia is a strategic step in strengthening Indonesia's defense. However, serious efforts must be built by all parties in the interests of the nation and state. REFERENCES Anggoro, A. (2017).

In Arthashastra, mandalas are represented by concentric circles that represent varying levels of influence and power. The theory emphasises the significance of diplomacy, war, and territorial expansion in the consolidation of power. Both the Mandal Theory and contemporary geopolitical realism acknowledge the pre-eminence of power and the pursuit of national interests in international relations. The theories highlight the significance of power, security, alliances, and territorial expansion in shaping the behaviour of states.

Ancient Indian political strategist and advisor to Chandragupta Maurya, founder of the Mauryan Empire. In his seminal work, the Arthashastra, he expounded the "Mandala Theory" as the foundation of his statecraft and foreign policy recommendations. In contrast, modern geopolitical realism, which has its roots in the works of scholars such as Hans Morgenthau and Kenneth Waltz, provides a contemporary framework for comprehending state behaviour in the global arena. Despite being separated by time, cultural context, and terminology, the Mandala Theory and modern geopolitical realism share striking similarities in their fundamental principles. Among them are the emphasis on state-centric politics, the pursuit of national interests, the role of power in international relations, and the strategic management of neighbouring states. This critical study examines the Mandala Theory of Kautilya's Arthashastra and its relationship to contemporary geopolitical realism. It seeks to untangle the historical and theoretical ties between these two paradigms, revealing how ancient wisdom continues to resonate in the contemporary global landscape. Literature Review: According to tradition, Chanakya, a Brahmin, served as Chandragupta's (321–296 B.C.) prime minister. The Mauryan Empire was founded by Chandragupta (G Modelski, 1964). After Alexander the Great's death, Chandragupta won his first campaigns against some of the satraps the Macedonian conqueror had established west of the Indus. 4780 Neuroquantology| November 2022 | Volume 20 | Issue 19 |PAGE 4780-4787|DOI: 10.48047/NQ.2022.20.19.NQ99440 DR. SANDIP SANE et al/Critical study on Mandal theory of Kautilya's Arthashastra and modern geopolitical realism eISSN1303-5150 www.neuroquantology.com Eventually, he turned against the Nanda Empire and was successful in destroying it. The conquests over Nanda’s gave Chandragupta control over a large portion of the Indian subcontinent, including the Ganges and Indus valleys and parts of the Deccan. According to the KautilyanArthashastra by (R Shamasastry, 2015), the Historical Context indicates that Chanakya composed arthashastra and one of the seminal works, mandal theory. a. Key Principles of the Mandal Theory: The Mandal Theory focuses primarily on mandalas, which are concentric circles representing various levels of influence and power. To protect national interests, according to Kautilya, a ruler must establish alliances and maintain a balance of power with neighbouring states. This theory emphasises the significance of diplomacy, war, and territorial expansion in the consolidation of power. In contrast to contemporary geopolitical realism: Modern geopolitical realism, as developed by scholars such as Hans Morgenthau and Kenneth Waltz, has a number of parallels with the Mandal Theory. Both theories acknowledge the importance of power and the pursuit of national interests in international relations. In an anarchic international system, realism emphasises the role of states as rational actors. b. Power and Security: In both the Mandal Theory and geopolitical realism, the importance of power and security is a fundamental principle. Kautilya argues that a ruler should work to improve their military capabilities and maintain a strong defence to deter potential enemies. To ensure the survival and stability of a state, realist scholars emphasise the importance of a strong military and a secure homeland. c. Alliance: Both theories emphasise the significance of diplomacy and alliances in achieving national objectives. The Mandal Theory emphasises the formation of alliances with nearby states in order to counteract potential threats. Additionally, geopolitical realism acknowledges the importance of alliances as a means of enhancing security and influence in the international arena. d. Territorial Expansion: The Mandal Theory supports territorial expansion as a means of consolidating power and resources. Kautilya argues that a ruler should pursue strategic conquests to ensure the economic well-being and safety of the state. Similar to geopolitical realists, geopolitical realists acknowledge that territorial control and access to resources are essential components of state power. e. Limitations and Critiques: Although the Mandal Theory and geopolitical realism offer insightful perspectives on statecraft and international relations, they are not without limitations. Critics argue that the emphasis on power and self-interest in international affairs may overlook the significance of ethical considerations and cooperation. Moreover, the Mandal Theory's emphasis on territorial expansion may not be consistent with contemporary norms and principles of sovereignty. While history demonstrates that his teachings were popular amongst statesmen, the manifestation of Kautilyan thought can be seen in independent India's policies, and the article urges a thorough reading of The Arthashastra as India assumes a leading role in international politics. (2009, R Zaman) (L. K. Jha and K. K. Jha, 1998). Examines the content of the treatise Arthashastra by the scholar Chanakya (economics). It provides a framework for the economic management of India and was written between 321 and 296 BCE. The conclusion is that Chanakya's Arthashastra is an ancient treatise of great significance to the study of economics. The article by (KavushAbosov, 2019) adds new insights to the existing literature on Russia's policies toward the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, including incapacity and identity, with implications for a better understanding of Russian foreign policy as a whole. The author observes parallels between the tactics employed by the Russians and those proposed by Chankaya in arthashastra. The Arthashastra is ascience of material gain'.Arthashastra is a science of political economy, according to D.D. Koshimbi 4781 Neuroquantology| November 2022 | Volume 20 | Issue 19 |PAGE 4780-4787|DOI: 10.48047/NQ.2022.20.19.NQ99440 DR. SANDIP SANE et al/Critical study on Mandal theory of Kautilya's Arthashastra and modern geopolitical realism eISSN1303-5150 www.neuroquantology.com (1964).The agreement reached by these scholars is unambiguous. According to (Boesche, 2004), the Arthashastra is a work of profound historical significance; it reveals the clarity of thought of one of the most successful political philosophers of the ancient period. It may also prove useful for discussions of the current state of multilateral diplomacy. For the purposes of this discussion. According to (Kangle, 2014), it is an art insofar as the practitioner must rely on experience and prudence, informed by Kautilya's general rules and guidelines, to apply them in particular contexts. In this manner, Arthashastra provides a strategy for governments to protect their territories, acquire the territories of others, and maintain all of these territories effectively. It includes the state's administration and foreign policy. It is the art and science of politics and administration. The historical and theoretical context of Mandala Theory in Kautilya's Arthashastra (L.N. Rangarajan, 1992), examines the principles and central concepts of contemporary geopolitical realism, as well as the works of eminent realist scholars.

Hypothesis 1: Mandala Theory is an early instance of realism in international relations. The Mandala Theory in Kautilya's Arthashastra and the Realism school of thought in 4782 Neuroquantology| November 2022 | Volume 20 | Issue 19 |PAGE 4780-4787|DOI: 10.48047/NQ.2022.20.19.NQ99440 DR. SANDIP SANE et al/Critical study on Mandal theory of Kautilya's Arthashastra and modern geopolitical realism eISSN1303-5150 www.neuroquantology.com international relations share a number of fundamental tenets. 1. State-Centrism: verses referred [7.1.20,22,24,26 ] Mandala Theory: The Mandala Theory highlights the importance of the state. It emphasises that the primary obligation of a state is to protect its own interests. Realism: Additionally, realism is state-centered in that it asserts that nation-states are the primary actors in international relations. States place their own interests first and foremost. 2. Self-Interest: verses referred [ 7.12.29,30,31] Mandala Theory: Kautilya emphasises the significance of pursuing self-interest and national security as the state's top priority. He advocates for strategies that increase the strength and prosperity of a state. Realism: The premise of realism is that states are primarily self-interested, seeking to maximise their power, security, and wealth. 3. Balance of Power: verses referred [ 6.2.21,22,24-29] Mandala Theory: The Mandala Theory emphasises the need to maintain a balance of power within a state's immediate neighbourhood (mandala) in order to prevent any one neighbour from becoming too powerful and posing a threat. Realism: Realist theory also emphasises the importance of the balance of power, which serves to maintain stability and prevent any one nation from dominating the international system. 6. Geopolitical Considerations:Verses referred [ 6.2.15, 6.2.16,17,18,19,20] , Kautilya, The Arthashastra. Mandala Theory: When evaluating the behaviour of neighbouring states, the Mandala Theory takes geographical and geopolitical factors into account. It suggests that geography has the ability to affect alliances and strategies. Realism: Realists recognise the importance of geography in international relations, but tend to place greater emphasis on power dynamics, capabilities, and the distribution of resources. 6. Self-Help and Aggressive Tactics: verses referred : [7.1.32,33,34,35,36,37] Mandala Theory: Kautilya advocates for proactive and, at times, aggressive strategies to protect the state's interests, such as espionage, diplomacy, and the use of military force. Realism: In an anarchic system, states must rely on self-help and may resort to coercive measures, such as military force, to protect their interests, according to realism. While the Mandala Theory and Realism share a fundamental realist perspective that emphasises the pursuit of self-interest and the centrality of states in international relations, the Mandala Theory places a greater emphasis on the dynamics within a state's immediate geopolitical environment. Kautilya's approach is distinguished from conventional Realism by its emphasis on the mandala and strategies for managing neighbours. Hypothesis 2: Mandala Theory is a Roadmap for Diplomacy and Foreign Policy The Arthashastra is a treatise written by Kautilya, also known as Chanakya, that contains extensive advice on diplomacy, foreign policy, and dealing with neighbouring states. His writings emphasise statecraft and the pursuit of national interests within the context of an anarchical international system. Here are a few of his key recommendations: Neighbourhood Diplomacy: verses referred [ 7.18.30,29 ] Kautilya emphasises the necessity of establishing and maintaining cordial relations with neighbouring states. He recognises that neighbours are the most immediate and, therefore, most crucial actors in a country's foreign policy. The objective of diplomacy should be to prevent these neighbours from becoming threats. Alliances and Treaties: verses referred [ 7.3.10,13,10,12,14,15 ] Kautilya emphasises the significance of establishing and maintaining amicable relationships with neighbouring states. He acknowledges that neighbours are the most immediate and, consequently, the most crucial actors in a state's foreign policy. The focus of diplomatic efforts should be on 4783 Neuroquantology| November 2022 | Volume 20 | Issue 19 |PAGE 4780-4787|DOI: 10.48047/NQ.2022.20.19.NQ99440 DR. SANDIP SANE et al/Critical study on Mandal theory of Kautilya's Arthashastra and modern geopolitical realism eISSN1303-5150 www.neuroquantology.com preventing these neighbours from becoming threats. Espionage and Intelligence Gathering: verses referred [ 1.12.20, 13.1.21, 9.6.54,55 ] The emphasis on espionage is a noteworthy aspect of Kautilya's counsel. He considers intelligence gathering and covert operations to be essential foreign policy instruments. Espionage assists a state in anticipating threats, gathering intelligence on rival states, and maintaining an advantage in negotiations. War as a Last Resort: verses referred [ 7.4.14,15,16,17,18 ] As a first option in foreign policy, Kautilya does not advocate for war. He proposes that war should only be employed when all other options have failed. He describes various strategies for exhausting diplomatic, economic, and psychological alternatives prior to resorting to military force. Economic and Trade Policy: verses referred [ 2.15.1-11,2.15.3, 2.6.21,2.15.10] Kautilya recognises the importance of economic prosperity in strengthening the state's position. He suggests that the state should encourage trade and protect its merchants and trade routes. Considered indispensable for financing the state's diplomatic and military endeavours. Assessment of Neighbour States: verses referred [ 7.6.24-29,32] Deception and Psychological Warfare: Kautilya's recommendations include the use of deception and psychological warfare to gain an advantage in negotiations and weaken the opponent. He suggests employing tactics such as sowing discord among rivals and utilising disinformation. Kautilya's advice on diplomacy and foreign policy in the Arthashastra reflects a realist perspective. It emphasizes the pursuit of self- interest and the use of a wide range of tools, including diplomacy, espionage, alliances, and military force, to protect and advance the state's interests in a competitive and anarchic international environment. His insights continue to be studied and have relevance in contemporary discussions of international relations and statecraft. Hypothesis 3: Ancient India's historical and cultural context is reflected in the Mandala Theory. The historical and cultural context of ancient India during Kautilya's time, commonly known as the Mauryan period (circa 4th to 3rd century BCE), had a significant impact on the development of Kautilya's Mandala Theory and his work, the Arthashastra. The following is a brief summary of the context: 1. Political Fragmentation: verses referred [ 2.29-7-12 ]. Before the rise of the Mauryan Empire, India was politically divided into a multitude of small kingdoms and republics. This political environment influenced Kautilya's understanding of statecraft and diplomacy, as he sought to establish a powerful, centralised state capable of consolidating power and managing relations with neighbouring entities. 2. Social and Cultural Diversity: verses referred [ 3.7.36,3.6.17-18 ]The cultural and religious diversity of ancient India was remarkable. Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, as well as numerous other religious and philosophical traditions, coexisted. This diversity contributed to a rich tapestry of ideas and values that shaped Kautilya's views on government and diplomacy. 3 Foreign Intrigues: verses referred [ 2.25.12,15, 2.28.19, 2.28.25 ]. It had interactions with neighbouring states and empires, such as the Seleucid Empire and the Nanda Empire. These interactions exposed the Mauryans to the complexities of international relations and diplomacy, influencing Kautilya's views on how to navigate these international relations. 4. Political Philosophy: verses referred [ 13.4.5,7.1.9,7.1.24-26,8.4.50]Ancient India provided a fertile intellectual environment for the development of political philosophy. The Arthashastra of Kautilya is regarded as one of the earliest works on statecraft and political science. It was influenced by the earlier writings of thinkers such as Manu and Brihaspati, as well as the contributions of contemporaries to the emerging field of political thought. 5. Economic and Trade Networks: verses referred [ 3.8.26-27,3.5.20,3.12.12 ]. Ancient 4784 Neuroquantology| November 2022 | Volume 20 | Issue 19 |PAGE 4780-4787|DOI: 10.48047/NQ.2022.20.19.NQ99440 DR. SANDIP SANE et al/Critical study on Mandal theory of Kautilya's Arthashastra and modern geopolitical realism eISSN1303-5150 www.neuroquantology.com India's extensive trade networks, which included the famous Silk Road, facilitated economic interactions with neighbouring regions. Kautilya's political and foreign policy strategies were fundamentally influenced by the economic factors of trade and resource acquisition. Mandala Theory and the Arthashastra were profoundly influenced by the historical, political, cultural, and philosophical context of ancient India during Kautilya's time. His work demonstrates a pragmatic approach to statecraft and diplomacy, tailored to the complexities of the time and the ambitions of the Mauryan Empire. Case Studies and Discussion: There are real-world examples and case studies that demonstrate the application of the Mandala Theory and modern geopolitical realism in various historical and contemporary contexts. I will also provide a brief analysis of how these theories have influenced state policies, alliances, and conflicts in these instances. 1. Cold War Power Dynamics: During the Cold War, the Mandala Theory had a profound effect on the strategies of both superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union. They focused on their respective neighbouring regions and endeavoured to establish spheres of influence. The United States, for instance, implemented the Mandala Theory by forming alliances in its adjacent regions, such as NATO in Western Europe. Influence of Geopolitical Realism: Modern geopolitical realism is compatible with the bipolar power structure of the Cold War era. States vied for power and influence, with a concern for a balance of power at the forefront. In superpower strategies, the realist approach of deterrence and containment was evident. 2. South China Sea Dispute: China's territorial claims and actions in the South China Sea can be analysed using the Mandala Theory as a lens. China seeks to establish dominance in its immediate geopolitical environment and expand its sphere of influence, which frequently causes tensions with neighbouring states like Vietnam, the Philippines, and Taiwan. Modern geopolitical realism can be used to comprehend the power balance dynamics in the South China Sea. Reflecting realist concerns about maintaining power balance, the United States and its allies have engaged in containment efforts to counter China's rise in the region. 3. Russian Annexation of Crimea and Ukraine War: The annexation of Crimea by Russia in 2014 is an illustration of the Mandala Theory in action. Russia viewed Crimea as a part of its immediate geopolitical sphere and sought to maintain its influence there, resulting in a conflict with Ukraine. Influence of Geopolitical Realism The international response to Russia's actions reflects realist principles. Western nations imposed sanctions on Russia and supported Ukraine to counterbalance Russian expansion, demonstrating a realist commitment to maintaining power balance and safeguarding national interests. Now these sanctions resulted in Russia invading Ukraine. 4. India's Foreign Policy in South Asia: The Mandala Theory can be utilised to analyse India's foreign policy toward its South Asian neighbours. India seeks to maintain influence and form alliances in its neighbouring regions, frequently engaging in diplomatic, economic, and military endeavours to protect its interests. Influence of Geopolitical Realism: India's realist approach aims to balance the power dynamics in South Asia, particularly in response to China's influence in the region. India's strategic alliances with Bhutan and Nepal reflect its realist concerns regarding the expansion of other regional powers. These cases demonstrate how the Mandala Theory and modern geopolitical realism can be applied to comprehend and analyse state policies, alliances, and conflicts in various historical and contemporary contexts. In today's complex geopolitical environment, these theories continue to be useful in the study of international relations and statecraft. Conclusion: 4785 Neuroquantology| November 2022 | Volume 20 | Issue 19 |PAGE 4780-4787|DOI: 10.48047/NQ.2022.20.19.NQ99440 DR. SANDIP SANE et al/Critical study on Mandal theory of Kautilya's Arthashastra and modern geopolitical realism eISSN1303-5150 www.neuroquantology.com  The Mandala Theory, an early form of Realism in international relations, emphasises the importance of the state and self-interest. It recognises the anarchic nature of the international system and stresses the need for a balance of power in the state's immediate neighbourhood (mandala) to prevent any single neighbour from becoming overly powerful and posing a threat.  Realism, on the other hand, acknowledges the absence of a global government or authority, which leads to self-help and competition among states. The Mandala Theory stresses the significance of pursuing self- interest and national security as a state's primary objective, advocating for strategies that increase a state's power and prosperity. It also takes into account geographical and geopolitical factors when assessing the behaviour of neighbouring states, suggesting that geography can affect alliances and strategies.  In the Arthashastra, Kautilya offers extensive counsel on diplomacy, foreign policy, and dealing with neighbouring states. He emphasises the significance of establishing and maintaining cordial relations with neighbouring states, forming alliances and treaties, espionage and intelligence gathering, war as a last resort, economic and trade policy, deception and psychological warfare, assessment of neighbouring states, maintenance of internal strength, balance of power, pragmatism and flexibility in foreign policy, and self- interest. Recommendations: recommendations based on the topic of comparing Kautilya's Mandala Theory with modern geopolitical realism:  Encourage Further Comparative Research Given the complexity and evolution of international relations, it is important to encourage further comparative research that explores the overlaps and differences between Kautilya's Mandala Theory and modern geopolitical realism.  Scholars should continue to investigate how these theories apply to various regions and contexts, allowing for a deeper understanding of their implications for state conduct and alliances.  Promote Cross-Cultural Dialogues: Cross-cultural dialogues between academics and policymakers can assist in bridging the gap between ancient Indian political thought and contemporary international relations. Encourage academic institutions and think tanks to organise conferences and seminars that bring together experts from diverse backgrounds to discuss the modern relevance of ancient theories.  Diplomats and policymakers can benefit from understanding the insights provided by Kautilya's Mandala Theory and contemporary geopolitical realism. It is crucial to promote educational programmes and training that acquaint practitioners with the historical and theoretical foundations of statecraft and diplomacy, allowing them to make more informed decisions within their roles.  Analyze the Ethical Aspects: An examination of the ethical aspects of these theories should be encouraged. Academics and policymakers should investigate how the application of Kautilya's Mandala Theory and contemporary geopolitical realism aligns with international norms, human rights, and ethical considerations. This can contribute to a more principled and ethical approach to state conduct and diplomacy.  The significance of ancient political thought in the contemporary world should be brought to the attention of the public at large. Educational institutions, the media, and 4786 Neuroquantology| November 2022 | Volume 20 | Issue 19 |PAGE 4780-4787|DOI: 10.48047/NQ.2022.20.19.NQ99440 DR. SANDIP SANE et al/Critical study on Mandal theory of Kautilya's Arthashastra and modern geopolitical realism eISSN1303-5150 www.neuroquantology.com government agencies can play a role in disseminating information about Kautilya's Arthashastra and other historical texts in order to improve the public's understanding of statecraft, diplomacy, and international relations. Future Study: The significance of ancient political thought in the contemporary world should be made known to the general public. Educational institutions, the media, and government agencies can play a role in disseminating information about Kautilya's Arthashastra and other historical texts in order to increase the public's understanding of statecraft, diplomacy, and international relations.
