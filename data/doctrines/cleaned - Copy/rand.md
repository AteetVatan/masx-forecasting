U241.L64 2008 355.02'18097309046—dc22 2008018294 iii Preface Counterinsurgency (COIN) is not a new challenge for the U.S. military, yet creating an appro- priate and uniform organizational response continues to bedevil the services. Typically, gener- ating a uniform organizational response is accomplished by the formulation of service or joint doctrine for a given type of conﬂict. Thus, the creation of new doctrine should be accompanied (perhaps after a lag) by an overall change in organizational behavior. This paper challenges this tight linkage between doctrine and behavior in the realm of COIN. By comparing COIN doctrine and operations in the 1960s to the more recent experience in Iraq and Afghanistan, it seeks to demonstrate that more-fundamental organizational changes (involving signiﬁcant trade-oﬀs) may be needed for the U.S. military to adapt to COIN both now and in the future. This research is part of a larger RAND eﬀort to develop a roadmap for long-term investment in Department of Defense COIN capabilities.

This interpretation assumes a tight linkage between doctrine as written and operations conducted. As one way to test this proposition, this paper compares modern COIN doctrine and operations with those of the 1960s. In the 1960s, two periods of COIN doctrine can be observed. The ﬁrst is 1960 to 1965, the period after John Kennedy was elected President but before U.S. combat troops were committed to Vietnam. The second is 1965 to 1970, the period of heaviest U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. In both cases, COIN doctrine as written by both the U.S. Army and U.S. Marine Corps emphasized the role of the population (so-called hearts and minds), civil- military relations, small-unit operations, intelligence gathering, and related concepts. Yet oper- ations seldom matched this written doctrine; instead, the military attempted to attrite the insurgency through large-scale operations and heavy reliance on ﬁrepower. In short, doctrine as written and operations conducted were not tightly linked. As at least a partial explanation for this weak linkage, this paper posits a deeper set of organizational concepts and beliefs that has a much greater inﬂuence on operations than writ- ten doctrine. While a set of beliefs can often be helpful to organizations in conducting their preferred missions, it can be detrimental in other contexts. Much of the U.S. military prefers high-intensity warfare, a mission for which the organization is mentally and materially well prepared. However, mental preparation for this mission makes the military poorly suited to COIN. Altering the set of beliefs oriented toward high-intensity warfare will require more than just new doctrine and some additional professional education. It will require signiﬁcant reori- entation of the services both mentally and materially. If correct, this paper casts doubt on the military’s ability to truly be a “full-spectrum force,” because attempting to optimize for the full spectrum of conﬂict may produce a force that is not particularly good at any one aspect of that spectrum. ix Acknowledgments Many people provided assistance with this paper. Reviewers Angel Rabasa of RAND and Carter Malkasian of the Center for Naval Analyses provided very helpful suggestions, correc- tions, and clariﬁcations. John Gordon IV and James Dobbins were both supportive and pro- vided useful comments on drafts. Massachusetts Institute of Technology colleagues Brendan Green, Llewelyn Hughes, Colin Jackson, Jon Lindsay, William Norris, Joshua Rovner, Paul Staniland, and Caitlin Talmadge also provided valuable input. GEN (ret.) Volney Warner provided insight into the Program for the Paciﬁcation and Long-Term Development of South Vietnam (PROVN) study while other retired military and intelligence community personnel related details about COIN in El Salvador. Conversations with serving military and intelli- gence community personnel were also vital to understanding current COIN operations.

While conceptually recognizing the total problem in our literature, Americans appear to draw back from its complexity in practice and gravitate toward a faulty premise for its resolution—military destruction . . . .1 Many authors have noted the United States’ massive and pervasive diﬃculty in conducting eﬀective large-scale counterinsurgency (COIN) operations. The country’s tendency to repeat the same mistakes during COIN has similarly generated a number of pithy analogies, with Bruce Hoﬀman’s comparison of the United States to the protagonist of the movie Groundhog Day being the most common and most apt.2 This paper seeks to address this repetition from a diﬀerent angle by comparing the development of the U.S. military’s doctrine for COIN in the 1960s with its development of a new COIN doctrine in the years after Operation Iraqi Free- dom (OIF). In doing so, it serves two purposes. First, it illustrates that doctrine as written in a variety of manuals is remarkably similar both within the two periods as well as across them. This will surprise those who believe that doctrine in the Vietnam era was somehow very diﬀerent. But the fundamentals of COIN remain constant even as speciﬁc contexts and circumstances change, and those who wrote doctrine were aware of at least the outlines of these fundamentals.3 Second, this paper argues that, as the epigraph from the Program for the Paciﬁcation and Long-Term Development of South Vietnam (PROVN) report cited above observes, written doc- trine has only a modest eﬀect on the actual conduct of COIN operations. This second point is of critical importance, as it refutes both highly optimistic and highly critical interpretations of the U.S. military’s relationship to COIN. Some optimists see the production of a new COIN doctrine as a moment of collective epiphany in the U.S. military. They believe that the U.S. military will embrace this new doctrinal approach with open arms, and rapidly adapt its opera- 1 U.S. Department of the Army, A Program for the Paciﬁcation and Long-Term Development of South Vietnam (PROVN), March 1966, p. 53. 2 Bruce Hoﬀman, Insurgency and Counterinsurgency in Iraq, Santa Monica, Calif.: RAND Corporation, OP-127-IPC/ CMEPP, 2004, p. 1. 3 Some argue that the fundamentals of COIN have changed over time; others argue that the so-called fundamentals have never been proven. This paper assumes that both of these assertions are incorrect. For a more extensive argument against these points, see Austin Long, On “Other” War: Lessons from Five Decades of RAND Counterinsurgency Research, Santa Monica, Calif.: RAND Corporation, MG-482-OSD, 2006, pp. 13–20. 2 Doctrine of Eternal Recurrence—The U.S. Military and Counterinsurgency Doctrine tions accordingly. Some critics, in contrast, ﬁnd it appalling that the last manuals issued on COIN before OIF dated to the 1980s. Had a manual for COIN been issued more recently, they seem to imply, the conduct of operations in both Iraq and Afghanistan would have been quite diﬀerent. Both of these interpretations hinge on a tight linkage between words written in a manual and actions taken in the ﬁeld. If this linkage is in fact not very tight, then both the optimistic and critical views lose much of their force. This paper concludes, in fact, that a military orga- nization’s structure, philosophy, and preferences (grouped under the general rubric of “orga- nizational culture”) have a much greater inﬂuence on the conduct of operations than written doctrine. It further argues that the culture of military organizations does more to shape doc- trine than doctrine does to shape operations. This argument is not new. During the last years of the Vietnam War, authors such as Robert Komer and Brian Jenkins were already discussing elements of this view.4 However, it deserves more-detailed examination in the context of current operations and doctrine. If cor- rect, the argument has signiﬁcant implications for current eﬀorts to produce a military capable of full-spectrum operations, because some operations may simply never be well executed by forces structured in a certain way. This paper ﬁrst deﬁnes the terms “counterinsurgency” and “doctrine.” Second, it presents a brief overview of the history of the two ground components of the U.S. military, the Army and Marine Corps, in relation to operations similar to COIN before 1960. Next, it presents selections from and analysis of COIN doctrine as presented in Army and Marine Corps manu- als from 1960 to 1965 and 1965 to 1970. It then assesses how well these manuals corresponded to operations undertaken in those periods. Finally, it presents similar selections from and anal- ysis of COIN doctrinal manuals from both services from 2003 to 2006, comparing these manuals with those of the earlier periods as well as to operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Doctrine and Counterinsurgency: Deﬁning the Terms The U.S. military has brief and easily accessible deﬁnitions of both doctrine and counterin- surgency. Doctrine is deﬁned as the “[f]undamental principles by which the military forces or elements thereof guide their actions in support of national objectives. It is authoritative but requires judgment in application.”5 COIN is deﬁned as “[t]hose military, paramilitary, politi- cal, economic, psychological, and civic actions taken by a government to defeat insurgency.”6 These deﬁnitions, though adequate, require some clariﬁcation. Doctrine is more speciﬁc than just “fundamental principles,” yet less speciﬁc than what are presently termed tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP). Some fundamental principles, such as the need for clear chains of command, are general enough to apply to virtually any mil- itary activity. Doctrine, however, is about a speciﬁc subset of military activity, such as COIN 4 See Robert W. Komer, Bureaucracy Does Its Thing: Institutional Constraints on U.S.–GVN Performance in Vietnam, Santa Monica, Calif.: RAND Corporation, R-967-ARPA, 1972; and Brian Michael Jenkins, The Unchangeable War, Santa Monica, Calif.: RAND Corporation, RM-6278-2-ARPA, 1970. 5 Joint Staﬀ, Joint Publication 1-02, Department of Defense Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms, Washington, D.C., April 12, 2001, as amended through October 17, 2007, p. 168. 6 Joint Staﬀ (2007), p. 128. Doctrine of Eternal Recurrence—The U.S. Military and Counterinsurgency Doctrine 3 or combined-arms assault. TTP, in contrast, are about very speciﬁc activities, such as clearing a building or suppressing an enemy position with indirect ﬁre. COIN is also more than just a laundry list of possible actions intended to thwart insur- gency. Instead, it should be viewed as a campaign that uses a variety of means to secure the population of a territory and restore (or create) the functions of government over that territory. At a minimum, these goals require (1) the government to possess a monopoly on the legiti- mate use of violence and (2) the disruption or elimination of insurgent forces and infrastruc- ture. Thus, COIN doctrine should provide a general guide to the conduct of a campaign that both (1) results in eﬀective security and governance of a certain population and territory and (2) attacks the insurgency. Small Wars Before COIN: U.S. Experiences Prior to 1960 COIN emerged as both a concept and a concern only in the aftermath of World War II. The collapse of empires and the emergence of nationalism and decolonization reduced or elimi- nated eﬀective governance over large areas of the world. At the same time, small arms of unprecedented capability became increasingly available, often provided by either the U.S.–led Western bloc or the Soviet-led Eastern bloc. Combining these factors with advances in com- munications and transportation made insurgency and COIN qualitatively distinct from previ- ous experiences. Yet the experience of creating or restoring governance was not in itself novel; both the U.S. Army and U.S. Marine Corps had previous experience with operations of this sort. The Army’s central experiences occurred during the Civil War, the Indian Wars, and the Philippine War. In all three cases, the Army was successful, if often brutal. Beginning with Generals Grant, Sherman, and Sheridan, the Army showed a willingness to apply extreme coercion and violence to civilian populations to accomplish its goals.7 Equally importantly, the Army conducted both the Civil War and Indian Wars without having to coordinate with either civilians or foreign militaries. Only in the Philippines was there a civilian agency, and, despite its limited ambit, its presence provoked civil-military tension.8 Whatever lessons the Army drew from these experiences were not well codiﬁed in doctrine, and instead remained diﬀuse. The Philippines is particularly interesting because it is in some ways the U.S. Army’s most successful eﬀort to restore governance in the face of guerilla opposition. The Army accom- plished this goal with an often uneven but overall successful mix of force application and development. Initial Army policy under BG Arthur MacArthur, Jr., was very benevolent and only slightly repressive, and had little eﬀect on the guerilla movement. This failure led to a divi- sion of opinion within the Army, with some advocating much harsher methods reminiscent of the Indian Wars and the Civil War. Others felt that more eﬀort to secure the population should be made but that care should be taken to avoid excessive use of force. This latter view 7 See Mark Grimsley, The Hard Hand of War: Union Military Policy Towards Southern Civilians, 1861–1865, New York: Cambridge University Press, 1995; Lance Janda, “Shutting the Gates of Mercy: The American Origins of Total War 1860–1880,” The Journal of Military History, Vol. 59, No. 1, January 1995; and Andrew J. Birtle, “The U.S. Army’s Paci- ﬁcation of Marinduque, Philippine Islands, April 1900–April 1901,” The Journal of Military History, Vol. 61, No. 2, April 1997. 8 See Rowland T. Berthoﬀ, “Taft and MacArthur, 1900–1901: A Study in Civil-Military Relations,” World Politics, Vol. 5, No. 2, January 1953. 4 Doctrine of Eternal Recurrence—The U.S. Military and Counterinsurgency Doctrine prevailed and became the basis of General MacArthur’s successful paciﬁcation plan of 1900 and 1901. Following the replacement of General MacArthur with MG Adna Chaﬀee in 1901, however, the brutal methods advocated by some were put into practice in places like Samar and Luzon. This ugly but geographically limited violence resulted in courts martial for some oﬃcers but also destroyed the remaining guerilla elements.9 It is also worth noting that the Army in this period was still in its infancy as a professional organization. For example, it did not yet have a General Staﬀ. Its mobilization for the Spanish- American War was haphazard; it had little control over the National Guard or informal units such as Roosevelt’s Rough Riders.10 Though these deﬁciencies were corrected over the next two decades, these limitations in terms of conventional war may have paradoxically made adap- tation to guerilla paciﬁcation easier. There were fewer “bad habits” for oﬃcers to unlearn, or those patterns of thought were at least less uniform throughout the oﬃcer corps. Subsequent Army experience with the restoration of government took place in the after- math of World War II. In Japan and Germany, the combination of devastation and formal surrender limited insurgency, and the United States deliberately chose (after some debate) to retain much of the civilian apparatus of the former governments. In both cases, this approach, combined with massive aid for reconstruction, was highly successful.11 In contrast to the Army, the Marine Corps had more-frequent but smaller-scale experi- ences with the restoration of governance. From the 1880s through World War II, the Marine Corps was involved in numerous interventions, mostly in the Caribbean and Latin America. In particular, the Marine Corps was engaged in Nicaragua for over six years in the 1920s and 1930s. The Marines, though not afraid to use violence, never had suﬃcient force in these coun- tries to use the types of coercive methods that the Army used. Furthermore, Marine Corps operations were almost always integrated with civilian agencies, particularly the State Depart- ment. (This earned the Marines the nickname “the State Department’s troops.”) The Marines also created or trained a variety of indigenous forces. Many of these experiences were codi- ﬁed in doctrine in the form of the Small Wars Manual, published in several editions through 1940.12 Neither the Army nor the Marine Corps was heavily involved in COIN between World War II and Vietnam. During the Eisenhower administrations, COIN was conducted primar- ily by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), in some cases supported by U.S. Army Special Forces teams. The Korean War’s guerilla elements operated as “adjuncts” to the conventional war rather than as a true insurgency. The U.S. military was also used during limited interven- 9 See John Gates, Schoolbooks and Krags: The United States Army in the Philippines, 1898–1902, Westport, Conn.: Green- wood, 1972; and Brian Linn, The U.S. Army and Counterinsurgency in the Philippine War, 1899–1902, Chapel Hill, N.C.: University of North Carolina Press, 1989. 10 See Jerry Cooper, The Rise of the National Guard: The Evolution of the American Militia, 1865–1920, Lincoln, Neb.: Uni- versity of Nebraska Press, 1997, pp. 97–107; Phillip Semsch, “Elihu Root and the General Staﬀ,” Military Aﬀairs, Vol. 21, No. 1, Spring 1963; and Graham Cosmas, “From Order to Chaos: The War Department, the National Guard, and Military Policy, 1898,” Military Aﬀairs, Vol. 29, No. 3, Autumn 1965. 11 See James Dobbins, John G.

The Kennedy Years: The Birth of COIN Doctrine With the election of John F. Kennedy in 1960, COIN became one of the foremost concerns of the U.S. government. President Kennedy believed that insurgencies aimed at undermining governments friendly to the United States were a major threat to national security. Within a year of taking oﬃce, he formed an interagency organization, the Special Group (Counter- insurgency), to study the problem. This group, which included the Department of Defense (DoD), the Department of State, and the CIA, produced an overall COIN doctrine (also called “overseas internal defense”) that was embodied in National Security Action Memoran- dum (NSAM) 182 in August 1962.13 The ideas embodied in NSAM 182 provided the overarching framework within which early COIN doctrine was developed in the U.S. Army and Marine Corps.14 These ideas, inﬂu- enced by prominent academics and think tanks like the RAND Corporation, focused on the central role of the population and its grievances against the government.15 In deﬁning insur- gency and the appropriate targets for countering it, NSAM 182 noted the following: Insurgency is grounded in the allegiances and attitudes of the people. Its origins are domes- tic, and its support must remain so. The causes of insurgency therefore stem from the inad- equacies of the local government to requite or remove popular or group dissatisfactions. . . . The U.S. must always keep in mind that the ultimate and decisive target is the people. Soci- ety itself is at war and the resources, motives and targets of the struggle are found almost wholly within the local population.16 A minor variation of this deﬁnition is used in the Army’s ﬁeld manuals (FMs) from this period. FM 31-16, Counterguerilla Operations (February 1963), uses the following deﬁnition: “The fundamental cause of a resistance movement is the real, imagined, or incited dissatisfac- tion of a portion of the population with prevailing political, social, or economic conditions.”17 The Army’s capstone manual, FM 100-5, Field Service Regulations-Operations (February 1962), uses this variation: “The fundamental cause of large-scale irregular activities stems from the 13 The White House, National Security Action Memorandum No. 182, Counterinsurgency Doctrine, Washington, D.C., August 24, 1962. 14 For a more general overview of the evolution of U.S. Army COIN doctrine, see Richard Downie, Learning from Conﬂict: The U.S. Military in Vietnam, El Salvador, and the Drug War, Westport, Conn.: Praeger, 1998, esp. pp. 47–60; and Andrew Krepinevich, The Army and Vietnam, Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1986, pp. 38–42. 15 For more detailed discussion of both the history and the theories of COIN, see Nils Gilman, Mandarins of the Future: Modernization Theory in Cold War America, Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2003; Long (2006); D.

FMFM-21, Operations Against Guerilla Forces (August 1962), uses the following terms: Resistance stems from the dissatisfaction of some part of the population. The dissatisfaction may be real, imagined, or incited and is usually centered around a desire for— (1) Political change. (2) Relief from actual or alleged repression. (3) Elimination of foreign occupation or exploitation. (4) Economic and social improvement. (5) Religious expression.19 At least rhetorically, the U.S. government had reached agreement about the root causes of insurgency and the appropriate targets of COIN. Early Doctrinal Views on COIN Organization and Operations The U.S. government was in similar agreement about how COIN operations should be orga- nized and conducted. NSAM 182 noted the following: In insurgency situations indigenous military action will be required. U.S. operational assis- tance may be a necessary adjunct to the local eﬀort. In these situations, U.S. programs should be designed to make the indigenous military response as rapid and incisive as pos- sible while parallel reforms are directed at ameliorating the conditions contributing to the insurgent outbreak. . . . Anticipating, preventing, and defeating communist-directed insur- gency requires a blend of civil and military capabilities and actions to which each U.S. agency at the Country Team level must contribute.20 This model of COIN became known as the “hearts and minds” approach after Sir Gerald Templer’s remarks about the British experience during the Malayan insurgency. Reform and good governance combined with judicious police and military action were the essence of this approach. Close coordination between military, police, and civil authority was a prerequisite for success. The U.S. Army’s doctrine generally accepted this vision, though with a slightly harsher tone. For example, the importance of a reform program is noted in FM 100-5: Irregular forces lose eﬀectiveness when not supported by the civil population, whether such support is provided willingly or gained through coercion. . . . The irregular force is usually a result and not the cause of the problem. The destruction of an existing irregular force 18 U.S. Department of the Army, Field Manual 100-5, Field Service Regulations: Operations, 1962, p. 137. 19 U.S. Marine Corps, FMFM-21, Operations Against Guerilla Forces, August 1962, pp. 2–3. 20 The White House (1962), pp. 12–13. Doctrine of Eternal Recurrence—The U.S. Military and Counterinsurgency Doctrine 7 normally does not provide a complete solution. The population must be convinced that the conduct or support of irregular activities will not only fail to gain the desired results, but may result in the imposition of sanctions and actually delay the elimination of the causes of discontent. Irregular forces accompany their operations with extensive propa- ganda designed to gain support of the local population. As a countermeasure, the local government being supported by the U.S., as well as U.S. forces, must present a concrete program which will win popular support.21 Similarly, FM 31-16 devotes an entire chapter to police operations and population control and includes a recommendation to establish “paciﬁcation committees” at the brigade and bat- talion levels. These committees were to include representatives from the military, paramilitar- ies, and civilian agencies.22 In FMFM-21 the Marine Corps also noted the importance of close coordination with both other U.S. agencies and the host nation, particularly local police and judicial authorities.23 Like the Army manuals, it devotes considerable attention to the population, noting that [c]ommanders must realize that operations against guerillas will seldom solve the problems of the area in which they occur. The guerilla force is only a symptom of the overall prob- lem which caused the resistance movement to arise in the ﬁrst place. Throughout military operations, a positive program of civil assistance must be conducted to eliminate the origi- nal cause of the resistance movement.24 Doctrine at the time also emphasized the importance of decentralized operations for COIN: Combat actions against guerilla forces are extremely decentralized until sizeable guerilla elements have been located. Even then, operations are centralized only to the degree neces- sary to eﬀect the destruction of the located enemy force. A continuous distribution of force in depth is necessary.25 FM 31-16 also emphasizes small-unit patrolling and reconnaissance as well as ambush. It further notes that police and population-control operations must often take place con- currently with combat operations.26 FMFM-21 also points to the need for patrolling and reconnaissance.27 21 U.S. Department of the Army (1962), FM 100-5, pp. 139–140. 22 U.S. Department of the Army, FM 31-16 (1963), p. 38.

Both describe attempts to conduct operations against insurgents without sound intelligence as a waste of “time, material, and troop eﬀort.”28 FM 31-16 also comments on the breadth of knowledge of nonmilitary factors needed for COIN: A basic essential in any type of counterguerilla intelligence operation is a thorough under- standing of the target area and society, in all its aspects, augmented by a complete under- standing of the prevailing internal and external forces supporting or subverting the soci- ety. . . . The basic inventory of intelligence on a speciﬁc area and situation is derived from the areas and country studies supplemented with situational intelligence collected more recently on the scene.29 In additioning to mentioning the importance of indigenous personnel, and providing a warning about them, FM 100-5 notes the importance of social and cultural knowledge during COIN: The nature of intelligence operations described above requires a knowledge of local cus- toms, languages, cultural background and personalities not attainable by U.S. personnel in the time allowed. As a result, local police, security and government organizations must be exploited to the maximum extent possible. Liaison personnel, interpreters, guides, trackers and clandestine agents are normally required. The loyalty and trustworthiness of these per- sonnel must be ﬁrmly established. Frequently, these personnel cooperate with both oppos- ing forces in an eﬀort to achieve maximum personal gains.30 Finally, FMFM-21 states that every Marine must be an intelligence collection asset and that small-unit actions must be based on this intelligence: Every Marine must have an understanding of the basic techniques and value of intelligence and counterintelligence in counterguerilla operations. This is necessary because of both his own immediate requirements in many situations and because of the requirements of higher headquarters. Each man must be observant and alert to everything he sees and hears. He reports anything unusual concerning the civil population and the guerilla force, no matter how trivial. Counterguerilla operations feature many small unit operations, and command- ers must be prepared to process, evaluate and act promptly on the observations made by members of his unit.31 FM 31-16 makes a similar point about the importance of individual soldiers reporting their observations as intelligence.32 28 This phrase is found in U.S. Marine Corps, FMFM-21 (1962), p. 17; and U.S. Department of the Army, FM 31-16 (1963), p. 92. U.S. Department of the Army, FM 100-5 (1962), pp. 147–148, also discusses the importance of intelligence for COIN. 29 U.S. Department of the Army, FM 31-16 (1963), p. 92. 30 U.S. Department of the Army, FM 100-5 (1962), p. 147. 31 U.S. Marine Corps, FMFM-21 (1962), p. 17. 32 U.S. Department of the Army, FM 31-16 (1963), p. 95. Doctrine of Eternal Recurrence—The U.S. Military and Counterinsurgency Doctrine 9 Both FMFM-21 and FM 31-16 comment on the need to coordinate intelligence among the military, police, paramilitary, and civilian agencies of both the United States and the host nation. They also note the need to go beyond traditional military methods of obtaining intel- ligence, recommending extensive use of clandestine informer networks. In particular, both manuals stress the importance of surrendered and captured enemy personnel as sources of intelligence.33 FM 31-16 emphasizes this point: “Prisoners of war are taken whenever possible. Every opportunity is given the enemy to surrender, except when the success of combat opera- tions depends on surprise.”34 Limits of Doctrine: Vietnam, 1961 to 1963 Doctrine as it appeared in print was thus broadly accepted by both the civilian and mili- tary communities from 1961 to 1965. Yet at the same time, public comments by some senior oﬃcers betrayed a hesitance to fully embrace the implications of written doctrine. Appear- ing to dismiss the diﬀerences between conventional war and COIN, Army Chief of Staﬀ GEN George Decker notably stated, “Any good soldier can handle guerillas.” His successor, GEN Earle Wheeler, argued, “It is fashionable in some quarters to say that the problems in Southeast Asia are primarily political and economic rather than military. I do not agree. The essence of the problem in Vietnam is military.”35 It was in Vietnam that the diﬀerences between written doctrine and actual practice became glaringly apparent. First and foremost, the principle of unity of eﬀort between civil and military elements of the U.S. COIN eﬀort enshrined in written doctrine was not upheld. The 1962 terms of reference for the creation of the position of Commander, United States Military Assistance Command Vietnam (COMUSMACV), clearly indicate that although COMUS- MACV was nominally subordinate to the Ambassador, he was in fact autonomous: The U.S. Ambassador, who as representative of the President is the senior U.S. representa- tive in Viet-Nam, will be kept apprised by the Senior U.S. military commander, in advance, of plans in the military ﬁeld, in order to assure proper coordination of U.S. activities. . . . In case of diﬀerences of view, any member of the Task Force would be free to communicate such diﬀerences to Washington for decision in accordance with already-existing proce- dures. While the Ambassador and the senior military commander will keep each other . . . fully informed on all high-level contacts with the GVN [Government of the Republic of Vietnam] and on major political and military plans, the operational command of U.S. mili- tary personnel will be the direct responsibility of the senior U.S. military commander.36 33 U.S. Marine Corps, FMFM-21 (1962), pp. 22–24; and U.S. Department of the Army, FM 31-16 (1963), pp. 95–98. 34 U.S. Department of the Army, FM 31-16 (1963), p. 96. 35 General Decker was Army Chief of Staﬀ from 1960 to 1962, General Wheeler from 1962 to 1964. Both are quoted in Krepinevich (1986), p. 37. 36 Maxwell Taylor, “Terms of Reference for the Senior United States Military Commander in Vietnam,” Memorandum for Secretary of Defense McNamara, January 12, 1962, in U.S. Department of State, Foreign Relations of the United States, 1961–1963, Volume II, Vietnam, 1962, Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Oﬃce, n.d. This wording diﬀers slightly from the terms approved at the January 3, 1962, Palm Beach conference. However, it is clear in the orders establish- ing COMUSMACV in February that Taylor’s was the view that prevailed. See U.S. Department of State (n.d.), documents 9, 18, and 53. 10 Doctrine of Eternal Recurrence—The U.S. Military and Counterinsurgency Doctrine The Joint Chiefs of Staﬀ would not tolerate the subordination of a four-star general to an ambassador, doctrine or no doctrine. Ambassador to Vietnam Frederick Nolting complained about this command relationship at some length, to no avail.37 Other deviations from written doctrine occurred in Vietnam during this period. For instance, many observers felt that the training of South Vietnamese forces was more appropri- ate to conventional conﬂict than COIN. President Kennedy’s military adviser GEN Maxwell Taylor, after visiting Vietnam in late 1961, reported the following: “It is our clear impres- sion . . . that, by and large, training and equipment of the Vietnamese armed forces are still too heavily weighted toward conventional military operations.”38 Roger Hilsman, director of the State Department’s Bureau of Intelligence and Research, came to similar conclusions after visiting in early 1963, further pointing out that this weighting resulted in part from American advice and support: You have also the impression that the military is still too heavily oriented towards sweep- type operations. There is still the same emphasis on air power as there was before. Almost every operation so far as I can tell still begins with an air strike which inevitably kills innocent people and warns the Viet Cong that they should get moving for the troops will be coming soon. I think . . . that the Americans are as much to blame for this as the Vietnamese.39 Many observers have since noted both this emphasis on conventional rather than COIN operations on the part of many (though not all) U.S. advisory personnel as well as the military’s overall preoccupation with a conventional invasion from North Vietnam.40 Attempts to Put Doctrine into Practice: The PROVN Study, 1965 to 1966 From 1963 to 1965, the situation in South Vietnam went from bad to worse. Coup followed coup in Saigon, while the Viet Cong (VC) grew stronger throughout the countryside. The complete collapse of South Vietnam seemed imminent despite increasing U.S. eﬀorts. GEN Harold Johnson, who became Army Chief of Staﬀ in 1964, was one of many deeply troubled by U.S. COIN eﬀorts in Vietnam. Upon returning from Vietnam in March 1965, General Johnson directed a select group of oﬃcers to undertake a reappraisal of eﬀorts in Viet- nam. This study was completed and issued in March 1966 as A Program for the Paciﬁcation and Long Term Development of South Vietnam (universally known as “PROVN”). PROVN was a lengthy and thoughtful study, but provided few (if any) truly new ideas. As previously mentioned, PROVN noted that U.S. COIN doctrine already contained the 37 U.S. Department of State (n.d.), documents 19, 25, 36, 40, and 52. 38 Maxwell Taylor, “Letter to President Kennedy,” November 3, 1961, in U.S. Department of State, Foreign Relations of the United States, 1961–1963, Volume I, Vietnam, 1961, Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Oﬃce, 1988. 39 Roger Hilsman, “Memorandum for the Record,” Saigon, January 2, 1963, in U.S. Department of State, Foreign Relations of the United States, 1961–1963, Volume III, Vietnam, January–August 1963, Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Oﬃce, 1991. 40 See, inter alia, Krepinevich (1986), pp. 56–66; U.S. Department of the Army (1966), p. 102; and Chester L.

Weller, The American Experience with Paciﬁca- tion in Vietnam, Volume 1, An Overview of Paciﬁcation, Alexandria, Va.: Institute for Defense Analysis, 1972, pp. 13–14. Doctrine of Eternal Recurrence—The U.S. Military and Counterinsurgency Doctrine 11 tenets essential to success. However, these tenets had not been fully or well implemented in practice. PROVN sought to provide a blueprint for the operationalization of COIN doctrine. First and most importantly, PROVN reiterated the doctrinal point that development and good governance should be central to all U.S eﬀorts: A viable, noncommunist government in SVN [South Vietnam] is fundamental to the achievement of U.S. objectives. Failure to develop such a public supported political order not only will preclude winning a true military victory, it will ensure losing a negotiated peace . . . . Long-standing and legitimate causes of insurgency are still present. Promises of reform melt into maintenance of the status quo.41 PROVN readily acknowledged that development required security, but pointed out that security was meant to enable development rather than be an end in itself. PROVN also called for a “single manager” for Vietnam who would be responsible for all aspects of U.S. activity there, and further argued that this should be (at least initially) the U.S. Ambassador. In addition, PROVN stated the following: To succeed, we must actually decentralize and delegate to Americans and Vietnamese at district and province levels the requisite resources and authority to accomplish the tasks at hand. Their exercise of this authority must be buttressed and sustained up through the chain of command. . . . Unity of command and eﬀort is required now at province level, with the province chief directing all GVN activities (military and nonmilitary) in the province. His counterpart, the SUSREP (Senior U.S. Representative), must direct all U.S. activities . . . . 42 This was a directive for actually implementing FM 31-16’s recommendation to establish “paciﬁcation committees” and NSAM 182’s call for unity of civil and military eﬀort. PROVN additionally stressed the importance of language training and knowledge of political and social factors. It repeatedly noted that wide variations between the situations in diﬀerent provinces and even between diﬀerent districts in the same province were to be expected. This variation would require detailed awareness of the speciﬁc local environment where those conducting COIN were assigned.43 Despite being an honest attempt to implement the doctrine that the U.S. government and the military services had promulgated, PROVN did not receive a warm welcome from much of the military. The oﬃcer who was nominally in charge of the study, Deputy Chief of Staﬀ for Operations LTG Vernon Mock, refused to sign oﬀ on it for distribution, saying to the authors, “Why don’t you come in early some morning and have one of the cleaning ladies sign it?” PROVN did not receive much more of a welcome from either the Joint Chiefs of Staﬀ or the COMUSMACV, GEN William Westmoreland. Others, such as Marine Corps LtGen. Victor Krulak, found it to be highly useful, as did civilians such as Ambassador Robert Komer.44 Yet the net eﬀect of the PROVN study on the military conduct of COIN in Vietnam 41 U.S. Department of the Army (1966), pp. 76–77, emphasis in the original. 42 U.S. Department of the Army (1966), pp. 61, 66. 43 U.S. Department of the Army (1966), pp. 2-47–2-50. 44 For the history of PROVN and reactions to it, see William Gibbons, The U.S. Government and the Vietnam War: Execu- tive and Legislative Roles and Relationships, Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1995, Part Four, pp. 201–212; and 12 Doctrine of Eternal Recurrence—The U.S. Military and Counterinsurgency Doctrine was minimal for the next several years. Instead, as detailed below, the U.S. military did almost exactly the opposite of what the report recommended. COIN as Practiced: Vietnam, 1965 to 1968 The introduction of U.S. ground forces in a combat (rather than advisory) role in Vietnam in March 1965 began a rapid cascade of U.S involvement in the war. Most signiﬁcantly for COIN operations, it meant that the COMUSMACV, General Westmoreland, at last had combat troops to command rather than to merely advise. He quickly began employing them in opera- tions, but these operations were not grounded in COIN doctrine as promulgated. The essence of operations from 1965 to 1968 was to apply maximum ﬁrepower to enemy “main-force” units in order to destroy them. By destroying enemy forces faster than they could be replaced, Military Assistance Command Vietnam (MACV) sought to bring the war to a favorable conclusion via attrition. To this end, U.S. forces sought contact with large units and then destroyed them, an approach known as “search and destroy.” This approach was premised on the idea of the massive application of ﬁrepower. General Westmoreland provided a one-word summary of his antiguerilla strategy: “Firepower.”45 In a less terse summary, General Westmoreland stated that if the enemy did not quit, the U.S. forces would “just go on bleeding them to the point of national disaster for generations.”46 General Westmoreland’s operations oﬃcer, BG (later LTG) William Depuy, summarized the MACV strategy in a statement to the press: “We are going to stomp them to death.”47 After being promoted to major general and receiving command of the 1st Infantry Division, General Depuy described the approach in more detail to Daniel Ellsberg: “The solution in Vietnam is more bombs, more shells, more napalm . . . till the other side cracks and gives up.”48 MACV’s actions more than lived up to this rhetoric. Over 4 million tons of indirect (air and artillery) ordnance was expended over South Vietnam from 1965 to 1973.49 Artillery forces alone expended more than 20 million rounds total of all calibers.50 Much of this ﬁrepower was not even employed in direct support of troops, instead being ﬁred in so-called harassment and interdiction missions. This meant ﬁring unobserved into areas thought likely to contain the enemy.51 Vast amounts of direct-ﬁre ordnance were used as well. In addition to using large quantities of ﬁrepower, the military spent considerable eﬀort on improving the quality of ﬁrepower. It developed new doctrinal guidelines for the employment Lewis Sorley, “To Change a War: General Harold K. Johnson and the PROVN Study,” Parameters, Vol. 28, No. 1, Spring 1998.

Units dispatched in helicopters from central bases spent a few hours or days “in the bush” (often quite far away from major population centers) and then returned to base. This was hardly consonant with COIN doctrine, which required signiﬁcant interaction with the population, both to provide security and to gather intelligence. However, given that the original goal of airmobility was to provide the ability to rapidly disperse and concentrate against armored forces on the potentially nuclear battleﬁelds of Europe, the inap- plicability of this tactic to COIN is not surprising. In fact, it was just another example of the feeling, common among many in the Army, that COIN was a lesser included case of war. One of the pioneers of airmobility noted the following after the end of the war: A brieﬁng of particular signiﬁcance took place in the late afternoon of 12 December 1960. . . . At that time the focus in the Army was on the nuclear battleﬁeld. Organic avia- tion was viewed by the Army as the best means of maintaining combat operations in an area characterized by great depth and frontage with the dispersion of many small self-con- tained units. The major threat was viewed as a sophisticated enemy attacking with masses of armor on the plains of Europe. Counter-guerrilla warfare at that time was viewed as a secondary mission. Nevertheless, the early planners in airmobility perceived that one of the automatic fallouts in organizing the Army for greater airmobility would be much greater capabilities in the lower spectrums of warfare.55 Instead of automatically making the Army more capable of COIN, airmobility actually undercut written doctrine by disconnecting troops from the population. In addition to emphasizing ﬁre and maneuver over paciﬁcation, combat forces in Viet- nam were also oriented toward centralized, large-unit operations rather than decentralized paciﬁcation and patrolling. Beginning with the 1st Cavalry Division’s battle in the Ia Drang Valley in November 1965, Army units were consistently employed in multibattalion opera- tions.56 Operations increased in size, as Operation Attleboro in September 1966 illustrated. Begun as a search and destroy operation by battalions of the 196th Light Infantry Brigade, Attleboro grew to include over 22,000 U.S. and allied troops, including General Depuy’s 1st 52 Boyd Dastrup, King of Battle: A Branch History of the U.S. Army’s Field Artillery, Fort Monroe, Va.: Oﬃce of the Com- mand Historian, Training and Doctrine Command, 1992, pp. 282–287. 53 See Jack Ballard, Development and Employment of Fixed Wing Gunships, 1962–1972, Washington, D.C.: Oﬃce of the Air Force Historian, 1982. 54 See Bernard Cole, “A Noglow in Vietnam, 1968: Airpower in the Battle of Khe Sanh,” The Journal of Military History, Vol. 64, No. 1, January 2000, pp. 149–150. 55 John Tolson, Airmobility in Vietnam 1961–1971, Washington, D.C.: Army Center for Military History, 1973, p. 12. 56 Krepinevich (1986), pp. 168–169; and Russell W.

Both were multidivisional operations with massive ﬁre support, with Junction City utilizing over 25,000 U.S. and allied forces.58 In contrast to the exhortations of written doctrine, MACV also signiﬁcantly slighted paciﬁcation and encouraged aggressive, large-unit sweeps with high volumes of ﬁrepower. This is apparent in the metrics for unit performance and oﬃcer evaluation chosen by MACV. The most infamous is the “body count,” the counting of enemy dead. Far from encouraging the military to provide security to Vietnamese civilians, the body count often meant that Vietnam- ese were simply designated enemies if they were killed. Jeﬀrey Record, who was in Vietnam as a civilian, concluded that the body count became such an important metric for success that it corrupted much of the war eﬀort: “[A]massing kills became the standard of career success for U.S. commanders, and therefore an often irresistible temptation to abuse in both the inﬂiction and reporting of enemy casualties.”59 Another metric that encouraged search and destroy over paciﬁcation was “battalion days in the ﬁeld.” This metric made the number of days each battalion spent conducting combat operations a measure of performance. While time spent in search and destroy counted in this metric, paciﬁcation missions did not.60 Other measures intended to ensure aggressive action against main-force units included number of combat sorties ﬂown, bomb tonnage dropped, ammunition expended, and ratio of U.S. deaths to enemy deaths.61 Not all U.S. military COIN operations adhered to the approach described above. Two programs in particular were notable for how well they tried to follow written COIN doctrine. The ﬁrst was the CIA and Army Special Forces–led Civilian Irregular Defense Group (CIDG) program, which sought to help ethnic minorities in the central highlands by both training self-defense forces and providing some development assistance.62 The second was the Marine Corps–led Combined Action Platoon (CAP) program, which combined a Marine squad with a paramilitary Popular Forces platoon to provide security at the village and hamlet levels.63 Despite being consonant with doctrine, both the Special Forces and the Marines experienced intense pressure to conform to the MACV model. CAP has been and remains the subject of much attention and debate. Some argue that the program was not terribly successful given its small scale, lack of suﬃcient troops to protect all hamlets, and the fact that such dispersed U.S. forces were vulnerable to being overrun by large enemy units. Others see CAP as a road to victory because CAPs provided local security 57 Bernard Rogers, Cedar Falls–Junction City: A Turning Point, Vietnam Studies Series, Washington, D.C.: Center for Military History, 1974, pp. 8–12. 58 Rogers (1974), pp. 16–24, 83–90; and Bernard C.

Doctrine of Eternal Recurrence—The U.S. Military and Counterinsurgency Doctrine 15 and invited attack from mass insurgent groups, thereby making these groups more vulnerable to ﬁrepower.64 There is some merit to both points of view (though this author leans more to the latter), but the important point is not whether CAP was a model for success or not. Instead, it is important to note that CAP was supported by existing doctrine for COIN in a way that harassing and interdiction ﬁre and search and destroy missions were not. Yet, it was search and destroy that dominated. Finally, civil-military integration was not well developed in this period. Not until 1967 was a real organization established to manage all civilian eﬀorts and to attempt to integrate them with military eﬀorts. This organization, Civil Operations and Revolutionary [later Rural] Development Support (CORDS), was headed by Robert Komer, who was acting as a deputy to the COMUSMACV. Although CORDS represented a step forward in integration, Ambas- sador Komer still had limited ability to inﬂuence how U.S. forces were employed. This was clearly not the arrangement advocated in doctrine and articulated in PROVN. Doctrine in the Late 1960s By March 1967, U.S. combat forces had been engaged in Vietnam for two years. New doctrine manuals began to appear in this period and, as one might expect, they demonstrated some signs of evolution. For instance, the new manuals were longer. The March 1967 version of FM 31-16 was about 25 percent longer than the February 1963 version; the December 1967 version of FMFM-21 (redesignated FMFM 8-2, Counterinsurgency Operations) was about 50 percent longer than the August 1962 version. Some shifts in terminology were also visible; FM 31-16 used the term “internal defense and development” rather than “counterinsurgency.” This shift is also evident in the September 1968 version of FM 100-5: The term “counterinsurgency” is used by the joint services, other governmental agen- cies, and many foreign countries. Within the U.S. Army, depending on the context, use of “stability operations” or “internal defense and internal development” is preferred to “counterinsurgency.”65 Yet despite these cosmetic diﬀerences, the doctrine produced in this period was funda- mentally similar to earlier doctrine. For example, the 1967 version of FM 31-16 notes the pri- mary importance of the population and the need for civil-military integration: Since the essence of the counterguerilla campaign is to win back the support of the people for the established government, the importance of civil aﬀairs is paramount . . . . [I]n internal defense operations, because of the importance of isolating the guerillas from the people, civil aﬀairs becomes one of the primary missions of the counterguerilla force. This is because all internal defense operations plans must be based on an integrated civil-military 64 Krepinevich (1986), pp. 172–175, presents a short version of arguments for and against CAP; for more detail see Michael Petersen, The Combined Action Platoons: The Marines’ Other War in Vietnam, Westport, Conn.: Praeger, 1989. Petersen, a former CAP Marine himself, concludes that a larger CAP program would have been less destructive but perhaps no more successful than the alternative. 65 U.S. Department of the Army, Field Manual 100-5, Field Service Regulations: Operations, 1968, p. 13-1. 16 Doctrine of Eternal Recurrence—The U.S. Military and Counterinsurgency Doctrine approach designed to progressively reassert host government control and gain the trust, conﬁdence, and active cooperation of the people.66 Similarly, the 1968 version of FM 100-5 describes the roots of insurgency much as earlier versions did: “Government ultimately depends on the acquiescence if not the active support of its citizens. . . . Thus, the basic causes of insurgency are the existence of one or more grievances and lack of faith in the government’s ability or desire to correct them.”67 The root causes of insurgency as described in FMFM 8-2 are identical to those presented in FMFM-21.68 In terms of organization for COIN, the 1967 version of FM 31-16 reiterates the call for the establishment of paciﬁcation committees, though they are renamed “area coordination centers” (ACCs). This later version provides more detail on these paciﬁcation committees than the earlier version, and speciﬁcally calls for the establishment of ACCs at all levels of political organization, especially the province, district, and village levels. The membership of the ACC is also enumerated, with the military, intelligence agencies, paramilitary, and police being the foremost members. FM 31-16 also calls for Civil-Military Advisory Committees (CMACs) to be established to advise the ACC, with members including judges, religious leaders, labor unions, and other respected members of the community.69 In terms of operations, the revised doctrines of the late 1960s were similar to their pre- decessors, although they frequently elaborated on earlier versions. FMFM 8-2 (December 1967), for example, devoted an entire chapter to the conduct of small-unit actions, noting the following: Operations against guerillas are characterized by small unit actions. They are conducted by numerous squads, platoons, and companies operating continually throughout the guerilla area . . . . The authority to conduct patrols is decentralized as much as practicable. Although overall patrolling policy and certain special patrols may be determined by higher headquar- ters, the extensive patrol activity and need for rapid response makes it desirable to assign patrol authority to lower echelons. Battalions, companies, or platoons may be assigned patrol authority. Flexibility is the prime consideration.70 The 1967 version of FM 31-16 also reasserted the importance of the population and pro- vided a caution about the use of ﬁrepower: Military operations must take into account protection of the civilian population. This is a problem in counterguerilla operations because the guerilla usually hides himself in the civilian population and ﬁghts from that base of support. Bringing artillery or airpower to bear on a town from which sniper ﬁre was received may neutralize the guerilla action, but it will almost certainly alienate the civilian population as a result of casualties among noncombatants.71 66 U.S. Department of the Army (1967), FM 31-16, p. 7-8. 67 U.S. Department of the Army (1968), FM 100-5, p. 13-2. 68 U.S. Marine Corps, FMFM 8-2, Counterinsurgency Operations, December 1967, p. 3. 69 U.S. Department of the Army (1967), FM 31-16, p. 32–33. 70 U.S. Marine Corps (1967), FMFM 8-2, pp. 72–74. 71 U.S. Department of the Army (1967), FM 31-16, p. 36. Doctrine of Eternal Recurrence—The U.S. Military and Counterinsurgency Doctrine 17 The 1967 version of FM 31-16 also devotes sections to the importance of consolidation operations (also known as “clear-and-hold operations”) as well as civil aﬀairs.72 Doctrine in this later period continued to emphasize the critical importance of intel- ligence for COIN. Cultural, political, and economic intelligence was still seen as important alongside traditional order of battle. In addition, FMFM 8-2 and FM 100-5 both stated that the need for and staﬃng requirements of intelligence in COIN were more intense than the needs of normal operations.73 Besides the formal and general doctrine produced by the services, MACV also began to produce its own COIN doctrine speciﬁc to the conﬂict in Vietnam. One example is the Hand- book for Military Support of Paciﬁcation (February 1968). This guide provided descriptions of paciﬁcation and of the military’s role in supporting paciﬁcation, as well as numerous speciﬁc TTP for COIN. The handbook’s introduction provides perhaps as clear and succinct a deﬁni- tion of COIN as can be found: Paciﬁcation, as it applies in the Republic of Vietnam [,] is the military, political, economic, and social process of establishing or re-establishing local government responsive to and involving the participation of the people. It includes the provision of sustained, credible territorial security, the destruction of the enemy’s underground government, the assertion or reassertion of political control and involvement of the people in the government, and the initiation of economic and social activity capable of self-sustenance and expansion. . . . The key to paciﬁcation is the provision of sustained territorial security. Territorial security is security from VC local forces and guerilla units and VC/NVA [North Vietnamese Army] main force units, if any are in or threatening the area. It also includes the protection of the people within a hamlet from the VC infrastructure and bullies.74 The handbook also provides guidance on how many of the other elements of COIN doc- trine relate to the speciﬁc environment of Vietnam. COIN as Practiced: Vietnam, 1969 to 1972 The Tet Oﬀensive of 1968 ﬁnally provided General Westmoreland with a chance to eﬀectively apply the ﬁrepower he had amassed in Vietnam. The results were devastating to the VC, but the mere fact that the VC could launch such a major eﬀort after almost three years of search and destroy was equally devastating to General Westmoreland. He was “kicked upstairs” to become Army Chief of Staﬀ, while his deputy, GEN Creighton Abrams, replaced him.75 General Abrams’ understanding of the war was clearly diﬀerent from his predecessor’s. After observing the war for several years he had come to accept, as written COIN doctrine elaborated, that paciﬁcation was a more appropriate strategy than search and destroy. General Abrams found many of PROVN’s recommendations to be very useful as well. He therefore 72 U.S. Department of the Army (1967), FM 31-16, pp. 63–69, 83–90. 73 U.S. Marine Corps (1967), FMFM 8-2, p. 28; and U.S. Department of the Army (1968), FM 100-5, p. 13-5. 74 U.S. Military Assistance Command Vietnam, Handbook for Military Support of Paciﬁcation, Saigon, February 1968, p. 1. 75 See Lewis Sorley, A Better War: The Unexamined Victories and Final Tragedy of America’s Last Years in Vietnam, New York: Harcourt Brace, 1999, for a positive treatment of Abrams time as COMUSMACV. 18 Doctrine of Eternal Recurrence—The U.S. Military and Counterinsurgency Doctrine began shifting operations toward small-unit action and calling for more restraint in the use of ﬁrepower. Some credit him, along with Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker and the CIA’s William Colby, with the Army’s shift to eﬀective paciﬁcation. Unfortunately, this shift was undone by the 1972 and 1975 conventional oﬀensives of the NVA.76 Closer inspection of what actually took place after Tet reveals a much more mixed record of change. Even a commander as well respected as General Abrams was unable to shift strategy easily. General Abrams bemoaned the inability of various subordinates, including battalion and division commanders, to change their conception of the war and thus the actual conduct of operations.77 Battles like Khe Sanh and Hue, in which the enemy stood and fought rather than running, appeared to validate the conventional warfare approach. Despite General Abrams’ top-down eﬀorts to change Army doctrine, “unoﬃcially, attrition remained in force.”78 LTG Julian Ewell’s career under GEN Abrams is a good example of the limits of change. General Ewell commanded the 9th Infantry Division in the Mekong Delta in 1968 and 1969, where his obsession with body counts and kill ratios earned him the nickname “Delta Butcher.” Writing after the war in an Army oﬃcial publication, he defended search and destroy: When one ﬁrst observes the ﬁghting in Vietnam, there is a tendency to assume that the current tactics are about right and that previous tactics were rather uninspired if not wrong. The ﬁrst conclusion is probably correct, the second is probably wrong. For example, one hears much criticism of the Search and Destroy Operations which were extensively used in 1967 and before. However, if one looks at the situation then existing and what was actually done, the tactics were pretty well chosen and did the job. Any reasonably eﬀective com- mander, after observing the enemy operate a while, can cope with him reasonably well.79 Elsewhere in the same publication, he derides paciﬁcation via development.80 One would not expect an oﬃcer advocating such an approach to prosper if strategy actu- ally changed signiﬁcantly under General Abrams. Yet General Ewell was promoted to com- mand II Field Force, an Army corps command, where he continued to serve under General Abrams in 1969 and 1970. He subsequently served as a military adviser at the peace talks in Paris. Whatever General Abrams himself may have believed about COIN, much of the rest of the Army continued to pursue more or less the same type of operations it had under- 76 Sorley (1999).

In some ways, the ﬁrepower ele- ment was actually emphasized more during this period as the number of ground forces declined.

Interlude: COIN and the Military, 1973 to 2003 The end of signiﬁcant U.S. involvement in Vietnam also marked the end of signiﬁcant U.S. interest in COIN for nearly a decade. The U.S. Army refocused on conventional high- intensity war in Europe and rebuilt itself into a well-trained, all-volunteer force. Doctrine, written by GEN William Depuy and his acolytes at the new Training and Doctrine Com- mand (TRADOC), was all but exclusively focused on defeating the Warsaw Pact signatories. The 1976 version of FM 100-5 is pure Central Front (except for a chapter that discusses the environmental eﬀects of deserts and jungles). The 1982 version presents a somewhat diﬀerent view of operations, but they are nonetheless focused on the same enemy in the same theater. The Marine Corps also began to turn away from COIN, though to a lesser extent. It ﬁrst sought a greater role in the European theater on the so-called Northern Flank of Norway. It subsequently embraced the Rapid Deployment Force (RDF) concept designed to intervene in and protect the Persian Gulf area from Soviet depredations. COIN did not vanish entirely; the Marine Corps published a revised version of FM 8-2 in 1980 and included discussion of low- intensity conﬂict in its new capstone doctrinal manual, simply titled Warﬁghting. The Reagan administration’s concern about insurgency in Central America in the 1980s led to a limited resurgence of interest in COIN. A new position in DoD, the Assistant Secre- tary of Defense for Special Operations and Low-Intensity Conﬂict, was established by Con- gress in 1986 to provide additional support and guidance on low-intensity operations, includ- ing COIN. One of the primary goals of low-intensity conﬂict in the 1980s was to help the govern- ment of El Salvador defeat the insurgents of the Frente Faribundo Marti para la Liberacion Nacional (FMLN). Yet the involvement of the U.S. military was strictly limited to a military advisory group of oﬃcially no more than 55 personnel (though this limit was circumvented to some degree).81 Furthermore, many of these advisers, who came from the special operations community, had relatively little interaction with the broader U.S. military. Most of the mili- tary remained much more concerned with NATO or RDF contingencies. Nonetheless, resurgent interest in COIN and growing concern about international ter- rorism did aﬀect doctrine. In 1986 the Army updated another COIN manual, FM 100-20, renaming it Field Circular (FC) 100-20, Low Intensity Conﬂict. This document covered COIN, counterterrorism, and peacekeeping operations. In 1990 FC 100-20 was updated and redesig- nated FM 100-20. The end of the Cold War was rapidly followed by the end of both the FMLN insurgency and the limited COIN renaissance. The U.S. military continued to be involved in various peacekeeping and peace-enforcement operations in the 1990s and continued to produce doc- trine for these operations. FM 100-20 was redesignated FM 3-7 and renamed Stability and Support Operations. 81 For example, according to some who participated, through the use of repeated temporary duty deployments, personnel not oﬃcially detailed to the advisory group spent signiﬁcant and often nearly continuous time in El Salvador. In addition, this limit did not directly apply to non-military personnel such as those from the intelligence community. 20 Doctrine of Eternal Recurrence—The U.S. Military and Counterinsurgency Doctrine With the attacks of September 11, 2001, U.S. concern about low-intensity conﬂict increased dramatically once again. The rapid assault on Afghanistan resulted in the quick ouster of the Taliban government but left nothing in its place. A new government was formed, but it faced an essentially lawless country ﬁlled with terrorists, warlords, and narcotraﬃckers. Yet even as the military and some civilian agencies sought to grapple with this problem, plan- ning for the invasion of Iraq began. The invasion of Iraq and ouster of President Saddam Hussein in 2003 went as well as the ouster of the Taliban, yet it again left the United States with a lawless and ungoverned coun- try. Within only a few months a Sunni Arab insurgency emerged, though it was not oﬃcially identiﬁed as such at that time. The U.S. military was about to engage once again in large-scale COIN operations. COIN Doctrine, 2003 to 2005 A new edition of FM 3-7 was actually released in February 2003, one month before the begin- ning of OIF. This edition (over 200 pages long) is not speciﬁcally and exclusively about COIN, but it contains many familiar elements from previous COIN doctrine. It uses the term “for- eign internal defense” (FID) rather than COIN in many instances, but nonetheless devotes an entire chapter to COIN. In discussing stability operations generally, it makes the following comment on intelligence: Stability operations and support operations demand greater attention to civil consider- ations—the political, social, economic, and cultural factors in an area of operations (AO)— than do the more conventional oﬀensive and defensive operations. Commanders must expand intelligence preparation of the battleﬁeld beyond geographical and force capability considerations. The centers of gravity frequently are not military forces or terrain but may be restoring basic services or inﬂuencing public support. Cultural information is critical to gauge the potential reactions to the operation, to avoid misunderstandings, and to improve the eﬀectiveness of the operation. Changes in the behavior of the populace may suggest a needed change in tactics or even strategy. Biographic information and leadership analysis are key to understanding adversaries or potential adversaries, their methods of operation, and how they interact with the environment. Knowledge of the ethnic and religious fac- tions in the AO and the historical background of the contingency underlying the deploy- ment are vital to mission success . . .82 This edition also stresses the importance of the population and of coordination between civilian and military eﬀorts.83 The chapter devoted to FID presents the following summary of COIN: Success in counterinsurgency goes to the party that achieves the greater popular support. The winner will be the party that better forms the issues, mobilizes groups and forces around them, and develops programs that solve problems of relative deprivation. This requires political, social, and economic development. Security operations by military and 82 U.S. Department of the Army, Field Manual 3-07, Stability and Support Operations, February 2003, p. 2-3. 83 U.S. Department of the Army (2003), FM 3-07, p. 2-15. Doctrine of Eternal Recurrence—The U.S. Military and Counterinsurgency Doctrine 21 police forces, combined with eﬀective and legitimate administration of justice, provide the necessary secure environment in which development can occur.84 The chapter then discusses the need for amnesty programs, the importance of police and paramilitaries, the need to avoid using excessive force, and the need to remain on the strategic defensive (but tactical oﬀensive) in COIN.85 Though comparatively brief, the same basic dis- cussions found in earlier Army COIN doctrine are present. The manual also contains appen- dixes on making interagency coordination work (Appendix A) and the nature of insurgency (Appendix D). Thus, the U.S. military that entered Iraq in 2003 did not lack at least general doctrinal guidelines for COIN. However, the 2003 version of FM 3-7 was not ideal. It covered such a broad range of operations that it did not provide suﬃcient detail on COIN. It was further lim- ited by its assumption that U.S. forces would typically provide advice and support rather than conduct combat operations themselves. By the end of 2003, the U.S. military realized that it needed a new doctrine manual more speciﬁc to COIN. The result, released in October of 2004, was the Army’s Field Manual– Interim (FMI) 3-07.22, Counterinsurgency Operations. FMI 3-07.22 elaborated on previous concepts (such as the importance of insurgencies that attempted to form a “counterstate” to replace the existing authority) but basically retained the same deﬁnitions and prescriptions for COIN. In discussing why insurgency happens and why the population is important, the manual notes that [t]he desire to form a counterstate grows from the same causes that galvanize any politi- cal campaign. These causes can range from the desire for greater equity in the distribu- tion of resources (poverty alone is rarely, if ever, suﬃcient to sustain an insurgency) to a demand that foreign occupation end. Increasingly, religious ideology has become a catalyst for insurgent movements. The support of the people, then, is the center of gravity. It must be gained in whatever proportion is necessary to sustain the insurgent movement (or, con- trariwise, to defeat it).86 FMI 3-07.22 repeatedly asserts that the population is the center of gravity in COIN. Additionally, it argues that intelligence must cover cultural, social, political, and economic issues.87 The importance of civil-military coordination is similarly emphasized.88 In discussing COIN combat operations, the FMI reprises familiar points from previous doctrine. One example is the possible negative consequences of ﬁrepower: The American way of war has been to substitute ﬁrepower for manpower. As a result, US forces have frequently resorted to ﬁrepower in the form of artillery or air any time they make contact. This creates two negatives in a counterinsurgency. First, massive ﬁrepower causes collateral damage, thereby frequently driving the locals into the arms of the insur- 84 U.S. Department of the Army (2003), FM 3-07, p. 3-4. 85 U.S. Department of the Army (2003), FM 3-07, pp. 3-4–3-7. 86 U.S. Department of the Army, Field Manual–Interim 3-07.22, Counterinsurgency Operations, October 2004, p. 1-3. 87 U.S. Department of the Army (2004), FMI 3-07.22, pp. 4-2–4-5. 88 U.S. Department of the Army (2004), FMI 3-07.22, pp. 2-10–2-13. 22 Doctrine of Eternal Recurrence—The U.S. Military and Counterinsurgency Doctrine gents. Second, it allows insurgents to break contact after having inﬂicted casualties on friendly forces.89 Other examples include the need for small-unit decentralized operations and the impor- tance of patrolling out among the populace.90 The FMI also has a section that discusses the importance of “clear and hold” operations (during which insurgents are driven from an area that is subsequently secured and developed); these are essentially paciﬁcation operations.91 COIN Operations, 2003 to 2005 In terms of COIN in Iraq, one of the ﬁrst observations, made in many other places, is that civil- military coordination was woefully inadequate at ﬁrst (at least at the top of each hierarchy).92 While the civil-military relationship appears to have improved under subsequent senior lead- ers, the actual command arrangements do not appear to have changed, making the relation- ship highly dependent on individual personalities. This is certainly not what is envisioned in doctrine. The U.S. military’s actual conduct of COIN in Iraq from 2003 to 2005 can charita- bly be described as highly variable. The military used an array of approaches ranging from ﬁrepower-intensive raids to population security. This variation seems to have depended partly on understandable diﬀerences, such as the region and time period, but mostly appears to be due to diﬀerent commanders. Some commanders heavily emphasized the security and devel- opment approach called for by doctrine. Others “increased kinetic activity,” a euphemism for employing ﬁrepower and raids. Two operations from November 2005 demonstrate the U.S. military’s tendency to dis- regard COIN doctrine. Operation Kennesaw Dragon, launched on November 14, 2005, involved Iraqi Army units, which cordoned the town of Ad Dawr, and the U.S. Army 3rd Infantry Division’s 1st Brigade Combat Team, which air assaulted to the outskirts of the town. After a one-day sweep that encountered little resistance, the units returned to Forward Operat- ing Base Wilson. Operation Clean Sweep, which occurred nearly simultaneously in southern Baghdad, was similar to Kennesaw Dragon, lacking only the air-assault element.93 Neither operation provided any enduring security to the population or did much to garner its support. Indeed, the area covered by Clean Sweep had been “swept” only a month before, yet continued to be problematic. Multi-National Force–Iraq (MNF-I), aware of this ongoing failure to understand COIN, opened a “COIN Academy” in response.

Doctrine of Eternal Recurrence—The U.S. Military and Counterinsurgency Doctrine 23 lence at Camp Taji aimed to ensure that all commanders fully absorbed COIN doctrine. Attendance was compulsory for all oﬃcers going to command in Iraq.94 In addition to training and education, the academy produced a guide similar to MACV’s Handbook for Military Support of Paciﬁcation. The MNF-I Counterinsurgency Handbook pro- vides a signiﬁcant amount cultural and historical context for Iraq and explains why this knowl- edge is important for COIN operations.95 It also provides a brief discussion of both COIN and FID, particularly noting the importance of avoiding purely “kinetic” operations focused just on killing insurgents.96 It also devotes an entire chapter to intelligence in COIN, reiterating the importance of concepts like “every soldier [is] an intelligence collector.”97 Finally, it notes the vital importance of the population, civil-military operations, and coordination.98 Doctrine and Operations in 2006 Despite the opening of the Counterinsurgency Center for Excellence, operations in Iraq still showed wide variation in acceptance of doctrine. In March 2006, for example, the U.S. Army’s 101st Division launched Operation Swarmer near Samarra. This operation, conducted jointly with substantial numbers of Iraqi troops, was described as the largest air-assault operation since the initial phases of OIF. Though touted by many as a success, Operation Swarmer appears to have been a brief sweep through an area that oﬀered little resistance. U.S. and Iraqi forces departed after rounding up suspected insurgents and some weapons caches.99 Even a cursory look suggests that Operation Swarmer was not doctrinal COIN, and that it did little to improve the security situation around Samarra.100 Furthermore, Operation Swarmer was not unique; it was only the largest and most notable of this type of sweep opera- tion. An MNF-I spokesman noted at a subsequent press brieﬁng that operations like Swarmer “continue all across Iraq. This happened to be a brigade-level operation in the Salahuddin Province . . .”101 Elsewhere in Iraq, other eﬀorts were much more doctrinally grounded. In western al- Anbar, Marines from 3rd Battalion, 6th Marine Regiment, and their successors in 1st Battal- ion, 7th Marine Regiment, moved from a central battalion base to many smaller bases among 94 Thomas Ricks, “U.S. Counterinsurgency Academy Giving Oﬃcers a New Mind-Set,” Washington Post, February 21, 2006. 95 Multi-National Force–Iraq, Counterinsurgency Handbook, 1st ed., Camp Taji, Iraq: Counterinsurgency Center for Excel- lence, May 2006b. 96 Multi-National Force–Iraq (2006b), pp. 20–29, 59–63. 97 Multi-National Force–Iraq (2006b), pp. 38–52. 98 Multi-National Force–Iraq (2006b), pp. 64–70. 99 Brian Bennett and Al Jallam, “How Operation Swarmer Fizzled,” Time, March 17, 2006. 100 For subsequent examples of continuing insecurity around Samarra, see Multi-National Corps–Iraq, Public Aﬀairs Oﬃce, “Coalition Forces Discover Sizable Caches South of Samarra,” Release No. 20061226-22, Samarra, Iraq, Decem- ber 26, 2006d; and Multi-National Corps–Iraq, Public Aﬀairs Oﬃce, “Iraqi Policy Find Bomb Near Golden Mosque in Samarra,” Release No. 20061212-11, Samarra, Iraq, December 12, 2006c. 101 Multi-National Force–Iraq, “Weekly Press Brieﬁng, March 23,” March 22, 2006a. 24 Doctrine of Eternal Recurrence—The U.S. Military and Counterinsurgency Doctrine the population. The resulting increase in the security of the population allowed for a build up of Iraqi police and greatly reduced insurgent activity in the area around Al Qaim.102 Though the exact approaches used in Al Qaim and Tal Afar may not be easily replicable elsewhere, doctrinally similar ones can be successful even in the most dangerous areas. Marines from the 3rd Battalion, 8th Marine Regiment, were able to secure a section of Ramadi, one of the most violent cities in Iraq, using techniques such as intensive patrolling, supporting Iraqi police, and taking a census of neighborhood residents.103 Notably, these techniques continue to be practiced by the Iraqi Army unit that operated with the U.S. Marines, even though the 8th Marines rotated back to the United States in late September 2006.104 Even as COIN operations continued in Iraq, new doctrine was produced. In June 2006, the Army and Marine Corps issued the ﬁnal draft of a new joint manual, FM 3-24/FMFM 3-24, Counterinsurgency. This draft shows more nuance in deﬁnitions and descriptions than previous manuals, in part because it incorporates signiﬁcant input from academics.105 Yet the basic substance remains similar. In deﬁning the objective of COIN, the joint manual states that [t]he primary objective of any counterinsurgent is to foster the development of eﬀective governance by a legitimate government. All governments rule through a combination of consent and coercion. Governments described as “legitimate” rule primarily with the con- sent of the governed, while those described as “illegitimate” tend to rely mainly or entirely on coercion.106 The manual also devotes a chapter to the importance of civil-military integration, high- lighting in particular the need for unity of command and unity of eﬀort: For all elements of the U.S. government engaged in a particular COIN mission, formal command and control using established command relationships within a clear hierarchy should be axiomatic. Unity of command should also extend to all military forces support- ing a host nation. The ultimate objective of these arrangements is for local military forces, police, and other security forces to establish eﬀective command and control while attaining a monopoly on the legitimate use of violence within the society . . . . All elements support- ing the COIN should strive for maximum unity of eﬀort. Given the primacy of political considerations, military forces often support civilian eﬀorts.107 The draft provides several examples of mechanisms for civil-military coordination, includ- ing Joint Interagency Coordination Groups, host-nation Country Teams, and Civil-Military 102 Charles Crain, “Counterinsurgency Strategy: Staying Put,” Christian Science Monitor, June 17, 2006. 103 Multi-National Corps–Iraq, “On Patrol with Marines in Ramadi,” Ramadi, Iraq, July 22, 2006a. 104 Multi-National Corps–Iraq, “Iraqi Army Conducts Census, Security Operations,” Ar Ramadi, Iraq, November 26, 2006b. 105 See Eliot Cohen, Conrad Crane, Jan Horvath, and John Nagl, “Principles, Imperatives, and Paradoxes of Counterinsur- gency,” Military Review, Vol. 86, No. 2, March/April 2006. 106 U.S. Department of the Army and U.S. Marine Corps, Field Manual 3-24/Fleet Marine Force Manual 3-24, Counter- insurgency, ﬁnal draft, June 2006a. 107 U.S. Department of the Army and U.S. Marine Corps (2006a), FM 3-24/FMFM 3-24, pp. 2-2–2-3. Doctrine of Eternal Recurrence—The U.S. Military and Counterinsurgency Doctrine 25 Operations Centers. It also notes two models employed in the ﬁeld, the Provincial Reconstruc- tion Team pioneered in Afghanistan and CORDS in Vietnam.108 The importance of intelligence is also highlighted in the draft in both a chapter and a more-detailed appendix. The manual notes that COIN is an intelligence war. The function of intelligence in COIN is to facilitate understanding of the operational environment, with emphasis on the populace, host nation, and insurgents, so commanders can best address the issues driving the insurgency. Both insurgents and counterinsurgents require an eﬀective intelligence capability to be successful. They attempt to create and maintain intelligence networks while trying to neutralize their opponent’s intelligence capabilities.109 The Marine Corps also developed two other complementary manuals: A Tentative Manual for Countering Irregular Threats and Marine Corps Interim Publication (MCIP) 3-33.01, Small Unit Leader’s Guide to Counterinsurgency. The Tentative Manual is focused at the battalion and above level of leadership and MCIP 3-33.01 at the company level and below. The Tenta- tive Manual, as its title suggests, is intended as much to provoke debate as to provide extensive guidance.110 In contrast, MCIP 3-33.01 includes a substantial amount of TTP information along with doctrine. Its focus is heavily on small-unit patrolling; it devotes more than 40 pages (out of 239) to the subject, and includes two patrolling-related appendixes. It also bluntly argues that security of the population must be paramount: “If you fail to secure the people, you will fail in COIN.”111 It further argues that securing the population requires living among the people: One of the most eﬀective ways to protect and establish relations with the people is to move in and live among them. The increase in COIN operations in the urban environment and the critical need to maintain contact and provide security for the local populace has driven us to conduct near continuous operations—primarily patrolling—at the riﬂe company level. In order to make this tactically feasible, riﬂe companies should normally establish a “ﬁrm base” (FB) inside of or in the immediate vicinity of the urban area where the patrols will operate.112 While MCIP 3-33.01 may be somewhat lengthy and too focused on TTP, as some in the Marine Corps have privately argued, it is nonetheless valuable as a clear guide for the kind of decentralized small-unit operations that have been at the heart of U.S. COIN doctrine for decades. The ﬁnal doctrinal development of 2006 was the December release of the oﬃcial version of FM 3-24; the Marine Corps oﬃcial designation was changed to Marine Corps Warﬁght- ing Publication (MCWP) 3-33.5. It is substantially similar to the June 2006 draft; indeed, 108 U.S. Department of the Army and U.S. Marine Corps (2006a), FM 3-24/FMFM 3-24, pp. 2-9–2-13 109 U.S. Department of the Army and U.S. Marine Corps (2006a), FM 3-24/FMFM 3-24, p. 3-1. 110 U.S. Marine Corps Combat Development Command, Tentative Manual for Countering Irregular Threats, Quantico, Va., June 7, 2006, p. i-ii. 111 U.S. Marine Corps, Marine Corps Information Publication 3-33.01, Small Unit Leader’s Guide to Counterinsurgency, June 2006, p. 73. 112 U.S. Marine Corps (2006), p. 74. 26 Doctrine of Eternal Recurrence—The U.S. Military and Counterinsurgency Doctrine the only major change appears to be the incorporation of an appendix on intelligence into the main body of the text.113 Like the draft manual, it emphasizes the importance of intelligence, civil-military operations, population security, and legitimate government. Getting It Right? COIN in Iraq, 2007 After a near-disastrous 2006 that saw rising violence in most of Iraq, 2007 saw improve- ment in the security environment, most strikingly in al-Anbar province but also in Baghdad. Some credit changes in military practice related to the new COIN doctrine with this improve- ment, along with an increase in troop numbers. While a detailed assessment of the situation is beyond the scope of this paper, it is important to note that the central improvements in secu- rity have resulted from fractures between insurgent groups rather than a major change in U.S. operations. As late as November 2006, Marine intelligence painted a grim picture of al-Anbar despite the doctrinally sound eﬀorts in places like Al Qaim and Ramadi.114 However, many tribes were in the process of splitting from Al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) and realigning with the United States (and to a lesser extent the central government of Iraq). While the United States proved ﬂex- ible in exploiting some of these fractures, U.S. successes occurred independently of doctrinal change. Furthermore, these maneuvers have not resulted in conditions amenable to long-term stability under a uniﬁed government. Instead, various tribes and factions jockey for power even as AQI lurks in the hinterland.115 Elsewhere, success is mixed or absent. In and around Baqubah, north of Baghdad, AQI and Shia militias such as Jaysh al-Mahdi battle to dominate the population. Some operational shifts have taken place. Many smaller bases have been opened, particu- larly in al-Anbar and in Baghdad. Partnering with Iraqi security appears to be taken much more seriously. Yet wide variation in U.S. military unit attitudes toward Iraqis (both in uniform and out) persists, and disagreements about COIN are still obvious at senior levels. Sometimes these disagreements have serious consequences in terms of operations undertaken or foregone.116 Komer’s Lament: COIN Doctrine vs. COIN Practice The preceding discussion presents the paradox alluded to earlier: If COIN doctrine has always been written one way, emphasizing elements such as population security and intelligence, why does U.S. military practice seem to vary so widely, and often proceed in direct opposition to written doctrine? Robert Komer’s 1972 diagnosis was that institutions, military and civilian, 113 Compare U.S. Department of the Army and U.S. Marine Corps (2006a), FM 3-24/FMF 3-24, Chapter 3 and Appendix B, to U.S. Department of the Army and U.S. Marine Corps, Field Manual 3-24/Marine Corps Warﬁghting Publication 3-33.5, Counterinsurgency, December 16, 2006b, Chapter 3. 114 Dafna Linzer and Thomas Ricks, “Anbar Picture Grows Clearer, and Bleaker,” Washington Post, November 28, 2006. 115 For a more detailed discussion of the shifts in tribal alignment in al-Anbar, see Austin Long, “The Anbar Awakening,” Survival, Vol. 50, No. 2, April/May 2008. 116 This assessment is based in large part on author’s personal observations and conversations with military personnel in Iraq from August 2007 to January 2008. Doctrine of Eternal Recurrence—The U.S. Military and Counterinsurgency Doctrine 27 “do their thing”; because no U.S. organization’s “institutional repertoire” is focused on the politico-military niche of COIN, all responses fail. In particular, Komer notes the following: Equally striking is the sharp discontinuity between the mixed counterinsurgency strategy which U.S. and GVN policy called for from the outset, and the overwhelmingly con- ventional and militarized nature of our actual response. The impact of institutional con- straints is nowhere more evident than in the GVN and U.S. approach to Vietnam’s military aspects, both before and after 1965. . . . The institutional background of U.S. and GVN military leaders helped shape the nature of that response.117 The essence of this argument is that a force that is structured to ﬁght a high-intensity con- ﬂict against another nation-state’s military is ill-equipped to adapt to the challenge of COIN. It is not just physically ill equipped but, much more importantly, mentally ill equipped. This is not an indictment of the intellectual capabilities of the military. Professional mili- tary oﬃcers are rarely stupid, particularly in the highly competitive ranks of the U.S. mili- tary. Rather, it is an argument that successful organizations such as the U.S. military develop structures, philosophy, and preferences, together referred to as “organizational culture,” to help them carry out their tasks. By virtue of long years of training and education, oﬃcers are inculcated with patterns of thinking that reﬂect this culture. In the case of the U.S. military, these patterns are both incredibly useful in high-intensity conﬂict (the mission of most of the military) and incredibly inappropriate in COIN. A number of these patterns of thinking aﬀect COIN practice. One is the search for deci- sive battle, which necessarily drives forces to seek large battles and thus leads to operations like Junction City and Swamer. Another is the drive to maximize use of available ﬁrepower. The understandable desire to protect and provide comfort to their units encourages oﬃcers to (1) adopt force protection measures that limit eﬀectiveness and (2) create large, comfortable bases away from the population. These patterns are so deeply inculcated that oﬃcers seldom recog- nize them, much less correct them. The contrast between the U.S. Army of 1898 and the U.S. Army of 2003 is instructive on this point. The Army of 1898, with its problematic organization and still-nascent professional education system, was fairly poor at conventional warfare. (Fortunately, Spain was not in a position to take advantage of this deﬁciency.) However, it did reasonably well in the Philippines in providing local security, governance, and development. The vastly more professional Army of 2003 has had the opposite problem; though capable of rapidly defeating large conventional armies, it has experienced problems in adjusting to COIN. While this comparison should not be overdrawn, since the two COIN campaigns are vastly diﬀerent, the point is that certain patterns of thinking that are useful for conventional warfare can be both counterproductive in COIN and diﬃcult to change. If these patterns of thinking are so common, then, why is there variation in COIN prac- tice? A partial explanation is that organizational culture, while pervasive, is not absolute. Some oﬃcers have the capacity and drive to become both warriors and scholars. Yet one cannot rely on attracting oﬃcers who have the drive, discipline, and intellectual curiosity to become both superlative oﬃcers and academics. Such individuals are to be treasured when found pre- cisely because they will be rare. Instead, creating a large number of oﬃcers who are good at 117 Komer (1972), pp. vi–vii, 37–59. 28 Doctrine of Eternal Recurrence—The U.S. Military and Counterinsurgency Doctrine COIN will require a complete revamping of the U.S. military, particularly its training and education. Some argue that this transformation is already under way, and that new COIN doctrine is prime evidence. Oﬃcers at the Command and General Staﬀ College talk incessantly about COIN, and the National Training Center has been restructured to reﬂect a COIN-like envi- ronment. In a few years, the U.S. military may indeed have fully adapted to COIN. Even if this hypothesized transformation is taking place (which remains debatable), another question arises: Having adapted to COIN, will the U.S. military still be good at high- intensity warfare? Seamless mastery of the full spectrum of operations is the desired end state. However, no military has been able to achieve this goal. The Israeli Defense Force (IDF) was once known for its mastery of mobile warfare, but this mastery has not served the IDF well in the past 25 years, which have been dominated by low-intensity conﬂict in Lebanon and the occupied territories. The IDF has produced some technical responses to the problem, and has adapted some of its operations, but it still has not mastered the challenge. Moreover, the recent brief war with Hizbollah even suggests that the IDF’s proﬁciency in mobile warfare may have eroded, as soldiers are now far more accustomed to long days guarding checkpoints than to the fast-paced nature of high-intensity conﬂict. Rather than moving from mastery of one end of the spectrum of conﬂict to mastery of the full spectrum of operations, the IDF may have become a master of none. Of course, one should not draw too many conclusions from a single case. But similar wor- ries are already surfacing in the United States.118 Ultimately, the erosion of U.S. high-intensity warfare capabilities may not matter, since the United States is unlikely to face a serious com- petitor at the high end of land conﬂict in the near term. Yet it bears considering as DoD tries to make irregular warfare a priority coequal with conventional war. Furthermore, even if some change does take place in the culture of the junior and even ﬁeld-grade components of the oﬃcer corps, it is unclear that this shift will be maintained after OIF. As previously noted, the U.S. Army radically reoriented toward conventional war in Europe after the Vietnam War. While conventional war in Europe seems unlikely, conven- tional wars in both the Middle East and the Korean peninsula are plausible alternative mis- sions for the Army. Similarly, the Marine Corps could shift toward more rapid-deployment– style missions of limited duration. Note that the variation in observed COIN practice in Iraq likely stems from diﬀerences in military organizations. Army Special Forces have always considered FID to be part of their core mission and have developed patterns of thinking appropriate to that mission. These pat- terns are often highly at odds with the larger Army. The Marine Corps falls somewhere between the Special Forces and the larger Army in terms of patterns of thinking. Of course, the Special Forces are not expected to win a high-intensity conﬂict alone and, despite the occasional exu- berant Marine rhetoric, neither is the Marine Corps. 118 See, for example, the remarks of the U.S. Army’s vice chief of staﬀ, GEN Richard Cody, in David Wood, “Warfare Skills Eroding as Army Fights Insurgents,” Baltimore Sun, October 24, 2006. Doctrine of Eternal Recurrence—The U.S. Military and Counterinsurgency Doctrine 29 Conclusion Written doctrine for any military task is necessary for COIN success (at least in the world of ground forces). More than mere words on a page are required, however. Organizational adap- tation, including alteration of the status of branches (e.g., expanding both the number and status of military police units while decreasing the number of artillery units), is much more important than doctrine. Yet this adaptation will produce both winners and losers in the orga- nization, and will result in both increases and decreases in organizational capacity for diﬀerent activities. Until these changes and the trade-oﬀs involved are recognized and implemented, doctrinal change will have a modest eﬀect, at best. 31 References Ahern, Thomas, CIA and Rural Paciﬁcation in South Vietnam, Washington, D.C.: Center for the Study of Intelligence, 2001.

Cover photo by Army Staff Sgt. Michael L. Casteel iii Preface This book examines counterinsurgency operations in Afghanistan fol- lowing the overthrow of the Taliban regime in 2001. It is based on repeated trips to Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India in 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2008. It focuses on the early stages of the insurgency—from 2002 until 2008—and examines why and how the insurgency began. It also draws lessons from the broader literature on counterinsurgency warfare and provides recommendations to help the United States develop capabilities and improve performance in future counterinsur- gency operations. The focus of this research is on the U.S. military. However, since the actions of other U.S. government agencies, coun- tries, international organizations such as the United Nations (UN), and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) are obviously important, they are discussed where appropriate. The results should be of interest to a broad audience of policymakers and academics concerned with coun- terinsurgency and the related issues of state-building, nation-building, and stability operations. This research was sponsored by the Oﬃce of the Secretary of Defense and conducted within the International Security and Defense Policy Center of the RAND National Defense Research Institute, a federally funded research and development center sponsored by the Oﬃce of the Secretary of Defense, the Joint Staﬀ, the Uniﬁed Combat- ant Commands, the Department of the Navy, the Marine Corps, the defense agencies, and the defense Intelligence Community.

A mixed group of insurgents comprised of the Tali- ban, Hezb-i-Islami, the Haqqani network, foreign ﬁghters, local tribes, and criminal organizations began a sustained eﬀort to overthrow the Afghan government. U.S. and coalition eﬀorts in Afghanistan oﬀer a useful opportunity to assess what works—and what does not—in counterinsurgency warfare. This study examines the beginning of the insurgency in Afghanistan and asks three major questions. First, what was the nature of the insurgency? Second, what factors have contrib- uted to the rise of insurgencies more broadly and to the insurgency in Afghanistan in particular? Third, what capabilities should the U.S. military consider developing to improve its ability to wage eﬀective counterinsurgency operations? The core argument of this study is that the United States should focus its resources on developing capabilities that help improve the capacity of the indigenous government and its security forces to wage counterinsurgency warfare. It has not always done this well. The analy- sis of 90 insurgencies since 1945 in Chapter Two indicates that three variables are correlated with the success (and failure) of counterinsur- gency eﬀorts: capability of indigenous security forces, especially police t local governance t external support for insurgents, including sanctuary. t xii Counterinsurgency in Afghanistan The U.S. military—along with other U.S. and coalition part- ners—is more likely to be successful in counterinsurgency warfare the more capable and legitimate the indigenous security forces are (espe- cially the police), the better the capacity of the local government is, and the less external support to insurgents there is. The indigenous govern- ment and its forces have a greater chance of gaining, in Max Weber’s words, a “monopoly of the legitimate use of physical force within a given territory.”1 In many cases, a signiﬁcant direct intervention by U.S. military forces may undermine popular support and legitimacy. The United States is also unlikely to remain for the duration of most insurgencies: This study’s assessment of 90 insurgencies indicates that it takes an average of 14 years to defeat insurgents once an insurgency develops. In the Afghan insurgency, the competence—and, in some areas, incompetence—of the indigenous government and its security forces have been critical factors. This analysis suggests that success in Afghan- istan hinges on three factors. First is the ability of the United States and other international actors to help build competent and legitimate Afghan security forces, especially police, which was not accomplished during the early stages of the counterinsurgency. Repeated trips to the regional police training centers in Afghanistan, as well as interviews with police in the ﬁeld, indicated that the Afghan National Police were corrupt, incompetent, underresourced, and often loyal to local commanders rather than to the central government. Indeed, the Afghan police received little attention and were a low priority in the early stages of the counterinsurgency. This was a mistake. The police are the primary arm of the govern- ment in a counterinsurgency because of their presence in local villages and districts. The U.S. military made signiﬁcant changes in the police training program beginning in 2005 and 2006, but persistence is the key to police reform. Based on the low quality of Afghan police when the Taliban was overthrown in 2001, police reform in Afghanistan will take at least a decade. 1 Max Weber, “Politics as a Vocation,” in H. H. Gerth and C. Wright Mills, eds., From Max Weber: Essays in Sociology (New York: Oxford University Press, 1958), p. 78. Summary xiii Second, the United States and other international actors need to improve the quality of local governance, especially in rural areas of Afghanistan. Field research in the east and south showed that develop- ment and reconstruction did not reach most rural areas because of the deteriorating security environment. Even the Provincial Reconstruc- tion Teams, which were speciﬁcally designed to assist in development and reconstruction projects, operated in pockets in the east and south because of security concerns. NGOs and state agencies, such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the Canadian Inter- national Development Agency, were also not involved in reconstruc- tion and development in many areas of the south and east. The irony in this situation is that rural areas, which were most at risk from the Tali- ban and where unhappiness with the slow pace of change was great- est among the population, received little assistance. The counterinsur- gency in Afghanistan will be won or lost in the local communities of rural Afghanistan, not in urban centers such as Kabul. This means the counterinsurgency must ﬁnd ways to reach these communities despite security concerns. Third, the United States and other international actors need to eliminate the insurgents’ support base in Pakistan. The failure to do so will cripple long-term eﬀorts to stabilize and rebuild Afghanistan. Every successful insurgency in Afghanistan since 1979 enjoyed a sanc- tuary in Pakistan and assistance from individuals within the Pakistan government, such as the Frontier Corps and the Inter-Services Intel- ligence Directorate (ISI). The Taliban and other insurgent groups enjoyed a sanctuary in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas and Balochistan Province. The Taliban regularly shipped arms, ammunition, and supplies into Afghanistan from Pakistan. Many suicide bombers came from Afghan refugee camps located in Pakistan, and improvised explosive device components were often smuggled across the Afghanistan- Pakistan border and assembled at safe houses in such provinces as Kandahar. The Taliban used roads such as Highway 4 in Kandahar Province to transport ﬁghters and supplies between Afghanistan and Pakistan. And the leadership structure of most insurgent groups (e.g., the Tali- ban, Hezb-i-Islami, the Haqqani network, and al Qaeda) was based in xiv Counterinsurgency in Afghanistan Pakistan. There is some indication that individuals within the Pakistan government—for example, within the Frontier Corps and the ISI— were involved in assisting insurgent groups. Solving this problem will require a diﬃcult political and diplomatic feat: convincing the govern- ment of Pakistan to undermine the sanctuary on its soil. This eﬀort became more challenging with the rise of an insur- gency in Pakistan by a range of militant groups, members of which assassinated Pakistani opposition leader Benazir Bhutto and conducted brazen attacks against the Pakistan army, ISI, and oﬃcials from other government agencies. Militants from Pakistan’s border areas were also linked to a range of international terrorist attacks and plots, such as the July 2005 attacks on London’s mass transit system, the foiled 2006 plot against transatlantic commercial aircraft ﬂights, foiled plots in 2007 in Germany and Denmark, and the 2008 arrests of terrorist suspects in Spain. These developments indicated that the insurgency in Afghan- istan had spread to neighboring Pakistan and required a regional solution. Most policymakers—including those in the United States— repeatedly ignore or underestimate the importance of locals in coun- terinsurgency operations. Counterinsurgency requires not only the capability of the United States to conduct unconventional war, but, most importantly, the ability to shape the capacity of the indigenous government and its security forces. U.S. military and civilian eﬀorts should focus on leveraging indigenous capabilities and building capac- ity. In some areas, such as air strikes and air mobility, this may be dif- ﬁcult. The recommendations in Chapter Seven cover eight functional areas: police, border security, ground combat, air strike and air mobil- ity, intelligence, command and control, information operations, and civil-military aﬀairs. In some of these areas, such as civil aﬀairs, the U.S. military should not be the lead agency and will need to coordi- nate closely with other states, international organizations, and NGOs. Indeed, the success of any counterinsurgency campaign over the long run ultimately requires a combination of military, political, economic, and other eﬀorts. xv Acknowledgments This book would not have been possible without the help of numerous individuals. The most signiﬁcant are Ben Riley and Richard Higgins from the Oﬃce of the Secretary of Defense, whose support and vision allowed this research to happen. Nora Bensahel, James Dobbins, Ali Jalali, and Barnett Rubin provided excellent and frank reviews of ear- lier drafts, which greatly improved the overall quality of the book. At RAND, Farhana Ali, Cheryl Benard, Keith Crane, David Frelinger, David Gompert, John Gordon, Martin Libicki, Ed O’Connell, Bruce Pirnie, William Rosenau, and Obaid Younossi provided valuable information on Afghanistan and counterinsurgency operations. Sev- eral others also imparted useful information and comments about Afghanistan, Pakistan, and counterinsurgency more broadly. They include Daniel Byman, Christine Fair, Bruce Hoﬀman, and Robert Perito. Hekmat Karzai and his Centre for Conﬂict and Peace Stud- ies in Kabul provided a wonderful opportunity to share ideas. Nathan Chandler provided key research support and collected data for many of the charts and graphs. I owe a special debt of gratitude to those government oﬃcials from Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, the United States, Canada, Aus- tralia, and Europe who provided critical information about insurgents and counterinsurgency eﬀorts and took time out of their busy sched- ules. Most did not want to be identiﬁed. Key Afghan oﬃcials to whom I talked over the course of my research included Foreign Minister Rangin Dadfar Spanta, National Security Advisor Zalmai Rassoul, Minister of Interior Ali Jalali, xvi Counterinsurgency in Afghanistan Ambassador Said Tayeb Jawad, General Ghulam Ghaws Naseri, National Security Council staﬀ member Daoud Yaqub, and Deputy Minister of Justice Mohammad Qasim Hashimzai.

A combination of U.S. Special Operations and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) forces, air power, and Afghan indigenous troops overthrew the Taliban regime in less than three months; U.S. forces suﬀered only a dozen casualties.1 Some individuals involved in the operation argued that it revitalized the American way of war.2 However, this initial success was quickly succeeded by the emergence of a prolonged insurgency as the Taliban, Hezb-i-Islami, the Haqqani network, foreign ﬁghters, local militias, and criminal organizations began a sustained eﬀort to overthrow the new Afghan government. This study deﬁnes an insurgency as a political-military campaign by nonstate actors seeking to overthrow a government or secede from a country through the use of unconventional—and sometimes conven- tional—military strategies and tactics.3 1 On the overthrow of the Taliban regime, see Gary Schroen, First In: An Insider’s Account of How the CIA Spearheaded the War on Terror in Afghanistan (New York: Ballantine Books, 2005); Stephen Biddle, Afghanistan and the Future of Warfare: Implications for Army and Defense Policy (Carlisle, Pa.: Strategic Studies Institute, U.S. Army War College, Novem- ber 2002); Gary Berntsen and Ralph Pezzullo, Jawbreaker: The Attack on Bin Laden and Al Qaeda (New York: Crown Publishers, 2005); Bob Woodward, Bush at War (New York: Simon and Schuster, 2002). 2 Henry A.

First, what was the nature of the insurgency in Afghanistan? Second, what factors have contrib- uted to the rise of insurgencies more broadly and to the insurgency in Afghanistan in particular? Third, what capabilities should the U.S. Department of Defense consider developing to improve its ability to wage eﬀective counterinsurgency operations? This chapter outlines the research eﬀort, and then provides a brief outline of the book. Research Design The research design adopted is straightforward. It included conducting an exhaustive set of primary source interviews in Afghanistan, Paki- stan, India, the United States, and Europe (including during multiple visits to Afghanistan in 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2008). These included conversations with several hundred government oﬃcials from the United States, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), as well as staﬀ from the United Nations (UN) and several nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). Finally, the research included a review and analysis of hundreds of govern- ment documents from the United States, Afghanistan, and coalition countries such as Germany and the United Kingdom, as well as tran- scripts and videos from the Taliban, Hezb-i-Islami, and al Qaeda. To supplement the research on Afghanistan, several researchers at RAND (including the author) built a data set of all of the 90 insurgencies that occured since 1945. Our goal was to identify the variables that can be correlated with the success and failure of insurgencies. This research design oﬀers a useful means for assessing U.S. coun- terinsurgency warfare capabilities because it provides an opportunity to examine what worked, what did not, and why.4 But there are draw- Defense Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms, Joint Publication 1-02 (Washington, DC: U.S. Department of Defense, 2001), p. 266. 4 In particular, see Alexander L. George, “Case Studies and Theory Development: The Method of Structured, Focused Comparison,” in Paul Gordon Lauren, ed., Diplomacy: New Approaches in History, Theory, and Policy (New York: Free Press, 1979), pp. 43–68. Introduction 3 backs to relying solely on a single case study such as this one.5 A single case is a limited laboratory for identifying those capabilities that are eﬀective across a range of counterinsurgencies, since conditions can vary across countries. For example, several factors beyond the qual- ity of the indigenous government and its forces can impact the out- come of counterinsurgency: geography (such as mountainous terrain); degree of urbanization; ethnic, tribal, or religious ﬁssures within the state; and economic conditions.6 In a single case study, there is rarely variation across these factors. Afghanistan, for instance, has rugged mountains in much of the country; a large rural population; a range of ethnic and tribal groups; and poor economic conditions. Conse- quently, a study of Afghanistan cannot provide a deﬁnitive assessment of what types of military and nonmilitary capabilities might be useful against insurgents operating among a homogenous population living in the jungle or in major cities.7 What may work in Afghanistan may not work in all other countries. 5 On the costs and beneﬁts of comparative case studies, see David Collier, “The Compara- tive Method: Two Decades of Change,” in Comparative Political Dynamics: Global Research Perspectives, ed.

First, the outcome of the insurgency in Afghanistan is of such intrinsic importance to the United States that its lessons are particularly important. The attacks in Washington, D.C., New York, and Pennsylvania on September 11, 2001, were planned in Afghanistan, and many of the hijackers received training there. Con- sequently, U.S. performance during the counterinsurgency campaign has signiﬁcant implications for U.S. national security. As the 9/11 Commission Report concluded, a U.S. failure to stabilize Afghanistan would decrease U.S. security by allowing the country to become a safe haven for terrorists and criminals.8 Second, a single case provides a good opportunity to carefully examine what worked and what did not, sometimes referred to as “process tracing.”9 It allows us to infer and test explanations of how U.S. capabilities and strategies aﬀected coun- terinsurgency eﬀorts—and why. As Alexander George and Timothy McKeown argue, case studies are useful in uncovering what stimuli the actors attend to; the decision process that makes use of these stimuli to arrive at decisions; the actual behavior that then occurs; the eﬀect of various institutional arrangements on attention, processing, and behavior; and the eﬀect of other vari- ables of interest on attention, processing, and behavior.10 The focus of this research is on the U.S. military and its capa- bilities for conducting counterinsurgency warfare. The actions of the White House, the Department of State, the U.S. Agency for Interna- tional Development (USAID), the CIA, and other U.S. government organizations are obviously critical during counterinsurgency opera- 8 The 9/11 Commission Report: Final Report of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States (New York: W.

Introduction 5 tions. So are the actions of other states, international organizations, and NGOs. As David Galula argues, counterinsurgency operations “are essentially of a political nature.” This means that “political action remains foremost throughout the war” and “every military move has to be weighed with regard to its political eﬀects, and vice versa.”11 Nev- ertheless, the military plays a particularly critical role in counterinsur- gency warfare—and will continue to do so in the future. While the focus of this research is on the role of the U.S. military and the devel- opment of its counterinsurgency capabilities, the role of other agencies is noted where appropriate. After all, the success of any counterinsur- gency campaign over the long term requires a combination of politi- cal, economic, and military resources brought to bear by a variety of governmental and nongovernmental actors. Outline Chapter Two critiques some of the current arguments about counterin- surgency warfare and oﬀers an alternative framework for understand- ing it. Chapter Three provides a brief overview of Afghanistan’s “age of Insurgency” beginning in 1979. Chapter Four examines lessons that can be learned from the insurgents, including the Taliban, Hezb-i- Islami, foreign ﬁghters, local tribes, and criminal organizations. Chap- ter Five outlines lessons from the Afghan government and its security forces, and Chapter Six examines lessons from the United States and coalition forces. The focus in these chapters is primarily on the strategic and operational level, rather than the tactical level. Chapter Seven pulls together lessons from the three sets of actors—insurgents, the Afghan government, and the U.S. military—and then outlines key capabilities for counterinsurgency warfare. 11 David Galula, Counterinsurgency Warfare: Theory and Practice (St. Petersburg, Fla.: Hailer Publishing, 2005), p. 9. 7 CHAPTER TWO Success in Counterinsurgency Warfare Most military ﬁgures and policymakers—including those in the United States—underestimate the importance of the indigenous government and its security forces in counterinsurgency warfare. This chapter argues that the focus of the U.S. military should be to improve the competence and legitimacy of indigenous actors to conduct counterinsurgency opera- tions. Achieving this goal involves increasing the capacity of indigenous security forces to wage military and nonmilitary operations, improv- ing governance, and undermining external support for insurgents. These steps are critical in winning popular support and ensuring legiti- macy for the indigenous government. This chapter begins by critiquing the current thinking on counterinsurgency warfare and then oﬀers a sounder strategy for success. The Fallacy of External Actors One of the key challenges in waging eﬀective counterinsurgency opera- tions is understanding the variables that impact their success (or fail- ure). Most assessments of counterinsurgency operations tend to ignore or downplay the role of indigenous forces and mistakenly focus on how to improve the capabilities of outside forces to directly defeat insurgents. This might include revising the U.S. military’s organizational struc- ture or increasing external resources (such as troops) to directly counter insurgents. This approach assumes the recipe for a successful counter- insurgency is adapting the U.S. military’s capabilities so it can win the support of the local population and defeat insurgents. The problem 8 Counterinsurgency in Afghanistan with this approach is that it ignores or underestimates the most critical actor in a counterinsurgency campaign: the indigenous government and its security forces. This mistake is common in the counterinsurgency literature. John Nagl argues, for example, that success in counterinsurgency operations is largely a function of an external military’s ability to adapt its organi- zational structure and strategy to win the support of the local popula- tion and directly defeat insurgents. But he largely ignores the role of the indigenous government and its security forces.1 In assessing the British performance in Malaya and the U.S. performance in Vietnam, Nagl concludes [T]he better performance of the British army in learning and implementing a successful counterinsurgency doctrine in Malaya (as compared to the American army’s failure to learn and imple- ment successful counterinsurgency doctrine in Vietnam) is best explained by the diﬀering organizational cultures of the two armies; in short, that the British army was a learning institution and the American army was not.2 General Frank Kitson, who participated in several counterinsur- gency campaigns in Africa, Europe, and Asia, similarly argues that a successful campaign needs to take into account three groups: the insur- gent group’s political structure, the insurgent group’s military structure, and the population. Kitson argues that external forces need to focus on defeating the insurgent’s political and military infrastructure and win- ning the support of the population.3 However, he largely ignores the role of indigenous actors. In his study of French counterinsurgency operations, Roger Trinquier makes a similar mistake. He argues that the key to success is adapting the external military’s ability to directly 1 John A.

Nagl later conceded that his book pays little attention to working with—and through—indigenous forces. 2 Nagl, Learning to Eat Soup with a Knife, p. xxii. Emphasis added. 3 Frank Kitson, Low Intensity Operations: Subversion, Insurgency and Peacekeeping (London: Faber and Faber, 1971), p. 49. Success in Counterinsurgency Warfare 9 defeat insurgent groups. The failure to adapt, he notes, was the main reason French forces were defeated in Indochina and Algeria: “The result of this shortcoming is that the army is not prepared to confront an adversary employing arms and methods the army itself ignores. It has, therefore, no chance of winning.”4 In addition, U.S. Army Colo- nel Timothy Deady argues that the United States was successful in the Philippines because of direct U.S. action. Using Mao Tse-tung’s apho- rism that insurgents are like ﬁsh that need a sea in which to swim, he concludes that American strategy eﬀectively targeted both the insurgents’ strategic and operational centers of gravity . . . . As American garrisons drained the local lakes, the insurgent ﬁsh became easier to isolate and catch.5 All of these works commit a similar fallacy: They ignore or down- play the role of the indigenous government and its security forces. This focus on winning counterinsurgency campaigns by improving the capabilities of external actors has become conventional wisdom among numerous military oﬃcials and counterinsurgency experts. However, such a strategy is misplaced. While improving the U.S. military’s ability to directly counter insurgents may be necessary to a successful coun- terinsurgency campaign, it is not suﬃcient. In particular, it underes- timates the importance of indigenous forces: Most counterinsurgency campaigns are not won or lost by external forces, but by indigenous forces. The quality of indigenous forces and government has signiﬁ- cantly impacted the outcome of past counterinsurgencies.6 Shaping a 4 Roger Trinquier, Modern Warfare: A French View of Counterinsurgency, trans.

It requires an understanding of the nature of the local conﬂict and the ability to shape the capacity of indigenous actors to conduct an eﬀec- tive counterinsurgency campaign. This includes a range of steps such as eﬀectively training police and improving governance capacity. Indeed, there are dangers in focusing too heavily on a lead U.S. role and improving U.S. military capabilities to directly act against insurgents. First, U.S. forces are unlikely to remain for the duration of any counterinsurgency eﬀort, at least as a major combatant force.7 Insurgencies are usually of short duration only if the indigenous gov- ernment collapses at an early stage. An analysis of all insurgencies since 1945 shows that successful counterinsurgency campaigns last for an average of 14 years, and unsuccessful ones last for an average of 11 years. Many also end in a draw, with neither side winning. Insurgen- cies can also have long tails: Approximately 25 percent of insurgencies won by the government and 11 percent won by insurgents last more than 20 years.8 Since indigenous forces eventually have to win the war on their own, they must develop the capacity to do so. If they do not develop this capacity, indigenous forces are likely to lose the war once international assistance ends.9 Second, indigenous forces usually know the population and terrain better than external actors and are better able to gather intelligence. Third, a lead U.S. role may be interpreted by the population as an occupation, eliciting nationalist reactions that 7 Kimberly Marten Zisk, Enforcing the Peace: Learning from the Imperial Past (New York: Columbia University Press, 2004); Amitai Etzioni, “A Self-Restrained Approach to Nation- Building by Foreign Powers,” International Aﬀairs, Vol. 80, No. 1 (2004); Amitai Etzioni, From Empire to Community: A New Approach to International Relations (New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2004); Stephen T.

Competent governments that can provide services to their population in a timely manner can best pre- vent and overcome insurgencies. An Indigenous Lead As Figure 2.1 highlights, insurgencies involve three sets of actors. The ﬁrst are insurgents, which include those groups that adopt unconven- tional—and sometimes conventional—military strategies and tactics to overthrow an established national government or secede from it.11 The second is the indigenous government, which includes the govern- ment’s security forces, such as the army and police, as well as its gover- nance capacity. Governance involves the provision of essential services to the population by a central authority in a timely manner, includ- ing health care, power, transportation infrastructure, and other basic services. The third group of actors comes from outside. These include states and nonstate entities, which can support the indigenous gov- ernment or the insurgents. As explained in more detail below, outside actors can play a pivotal role in tipping the war in favor of insurgents 10 David M. Edelstein, “Occupational Hazards: Why Military Occupations Succeed or Fail,” International Security, Vol. 29, No. 1 (Summer 2004), p. 51. 11 The Department of Defense Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms (Joint Publication 1-02) deﬁnes unconventional warfare as A broad spectrum of military and paramilitary operations, normally of long duration, predominately conducted by indigenous or surrogate forces who are organized, trained, equipped, supported and directed in varying degrees by an external source. It includes guerrilla warfare, and other direct oﬀensive, low visibility, covert, or clandestine opera- tions, as well as the indirect activated of subversion, sabotage, intelligence activities and evasion and escape. Consequently, conventional war refers to warfare conducted by using conventional military weapons—such as tanks and artillery—and battleﬁeld tactics between two or more states in open confrontation. See, for example, Department of Defense Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms, p. 556. 12 Counterinsurgency in Afghanistan or the government. However, outside actors alone can rarely win the war for either side. Popular support is a common goal for all actors in an insurgency. Both winning support and preventing insurgents from gaining sup- port are critical components of any counterinsurgency.12 With popu- lar support comes assistance—money, logistics, recruits, intelligence, and other aid—from the local population. Building on Mao Tse-tung’s argument that the guerrilla must move among the people as a ﬁsh swims in the sea, British General Sir Frank Kitson argued that the population 12 Bruce Hoﬀman, Insurgency and Counterinsurgency in Iraq (Santa Monica, Calif.: RAND Corporation, OP-127-IPC/CMEPP, 2004); U.S. Marine Corps, Small Wars Manual (Wash- ington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Oﬃce, 1940); Julian Pagent, Counter-Insurgency Campaigning (London: Faber and Faber, 1967); Charles Simpson, Inside the Green Berets: The First Thirty Years (Novato, Calif.: Presidio Press, 1982); Robert J.

Figure 2.1 A Counterinsurgency Framework External actors RAND MG595-2.1 Insurgent groups Indigenous government Population Success in Counterinsurgency Warfare 13 is a critical element in counterinsurgency operations as “this represents the water in which the ﬁsh swims.”13 The Afghan insurgency can be understood using the framework in Figure 2.1. The Afghan government and such forces as the Afghan National Army (ANA) and Afghan National Police (ANP) are the primary indigenous counterinsurgency actors. The Taliban, Hezb-i- Islami, the Haqqani network, foreign ﬁghters, criminal groups, and a host of Afghan and Pakistani tribal militias are the primary insurgent forces. There are two sets of external actors. The United States, NATO forces, and other international actors such as the United Nations are the primary external actors that support the Afghan government. The broad jihadist network, individuals within the Pakistan government, and Pakistani and Afghan tribes are the primary external actors that support the insurgents. In between the two sides are the Afghan and, to some degree, Pakistani populations, which lie at the center of insur- gent and counterinsurgent eﬀorts. The population is particularly critical to insurgents because of their relative weakness. Insurgents generally cannot attack their oppo- nents in a conventional manner, as the government forces are usually much more capable of waging conventional warfare. This asymmetry in power forces insurgents to carry the ﬁght to an arena in which they have a better chance of success. To many insurgents, the population oﬀers a level playing ﬁeld. If insurgents manage to alienate the popu- lation from the government and acquire its active support, they are more likely to win the war. In the end, the exercise of political power depends on the tacit or explicit agreement of the population—or, at worst, on its submissiveness.14 Figure 2.2 illustrates the framework of the counterinsurgency campaign in Afghanistan. As the dotted lines indicate, outside actors such as the U.S. military are likely to play an indirect role over the long run by providing resources to the Afghan government. It is unlikely 13 Kitson, Low Intensity Operations, p. 49. On counterinsurgency strategies, also see Colonel C. E. Callwell, Small Wars: Their Principles and Practice, 3rd ed.

As the solid line indicates, the long-term struggle is between the Afghan government and insurgent groups. To identify the critical variables that have contributed to the suc- cess or failure of past insurgencies, RAND constructed a data set aggre- gating information on insurgencies occurring since World War II.15 These insurgencies met the following three criteria: (1) they involved ﬁghting between agents of (or claimants to) a state and nonstate groups who sought to take control of a government, take power in a region, or use violence to change government policies; (2) at least 1,000 individu- als were killed over the course of the conﬂict, with a yearly average of at least 100; and (3) at least 100 were killed on both sides (including civilians attacked by rebels). These criteria resulted in a list of 90 insur- gencies, which is provided in the appendix. 15 Unpublished RAND research for the U.S. Department of Defense.

Security Forces The capability of the government security forces to defeat insurgents and establish law and order is paramount to the success of any counter- insurgency. Insurgents are better able to survive and prosper if the secu- rity forces they oppose are relatively weak and lack legitimacy with the population. These forces may be badly ﬁnanced and equipped, orga- nizationally inept, corrupt, politically divided, and poorly informed about events at the local level.17 Indigenous governments often rely on military and paramilitary forces to conduct a signiﬁcant part of a counterinsurgency, since they may have more ﬁrepower than police to use against well-armed insurgent forces. There are numerous ideal characteristics of these forces at the tactical and operational levels, but several of the most important include a high level of initiative, good intelligence, integration across units and services, quality leadership, motivated soldiers, and the ability to learn and adapt during combat.18 As Figure 2.3 illustrates, there is some correlation between government 16 For example, mountainous terrain, larger populations, and lower per capita income levels increase the likelihood of insurgent success. But indigenous government and external powers such as the United States can do little about these variables.

While military and paramilitary forces play a key role, the police are perhaps the most critical component of indigenous forces. They are the primary arm of the government focused on internal security mat- ters. Unlike the military, the police usually have a permanent pres- ence in cities, towns, and villages; a better understanding of the threat environment in these areas; and better intelligence. This makes them 19 We assessed the capability of government security forces by making a qualitative judg- ment about how competent their forces were in conducting counterinsurgency warfare. We tried to avoid the endogeneity problem of coding forces as competent if the government won—and incompetent if they lost. Rather, we relied on the judgments of area special- ists and historians that covered each insurgency. Unpublished RAND research for the U.S. Department of Defense.

The mission of the police and other security forces should be to eliminate the insurgent organization—the command structure, guer- rillas, logistics support, and ﬁnancial and political support—from the midst of the population.20 An eﬀective police force is also critical to the success of a counterinsurgency because there are limits to the use of military force—the enemy frequently holds little territory and refuses to ﬁght for the territory that it does hold. Counterinsurgent military forces may be able to penetrate and garrison an insurgent area and, if well sustained, may reduce guerrilla activity. But, once the situation in an area becomes untenable for insurgents, they will simply transfer their activity to another area and the problem remains unresolved. As David Galula argues, “[C]onventional operations by themselves have at best no more eﬀect than a ﬂy swatter. Some guerrillas are bound to be caught, but new recruits will replace them as fast as they are lost.”21 A viable indigenous police force with a permanent presence in urban and rural areas is a critical component of counterinsurgency. This poses a challenge for the U.S. military, since it is not ipso facto the lead U.S. agency for police training abroad. In the early 1970s, the U.S. Congress became deeply concerned that U.S. assistance abroad frequently strengthened the recipient governments’ capacity for repres- sion.22 Consequently, Congress adopted Section 660 of the Foreign Assistance Act in 1974, which prohibited the United States from pro- viding internal security assistance to foreign governments, stating that the U.S. government cannot provide training or advice, or provide any ﬁnancial support, for police, prisons, or other law enforcement forces for any foreign government or any program of internal intelligence or surveil- 20 Trinquier, Modern Warfare, p. 43; Galula, Counterinsurgency Warfare, p. 31. 21 Galula, Counterinsurgency Warfare, p. 72. 22 Michael McClintock, The American Connection (London: Zed Books, 1985); Martha K. Huggins, Political Policing: The United States and Latin America (Durham, N.C.: Duke Uni- versity Press, 1998). 18 Counterinsurgency in Afghanistan lance on behalf of any foreign government within the United States or abroad.23 The end of the Cold War and the increasing tempo of U.S. stabil- ity operations after 1989 rendered the 1974 legislation largely obsolete. U.S. government agencies increasingly secured waivers and provided police assistance to a range of regimes. Most foreign police training has been done by the U.S. Department of Justice’s International Criminal Investigative Training Assistance Program, as well as the U.S. Depart- ment of State’s Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforce- ment. Historically, the U.S. military provided limited police training in the context of stability operations. In Afghanistan and Iraq, how- ever, the U.S. military greatly increased its police training initiatives. Governance Capacity There is also evidence that indigenous governance capacity impacts the outcome of counterinsurgencies.24 The stronger and more competent a government is in providing services to its population, the greater its ability to undermine popular support for insurgents and the more likely that it can defeat an insurgency. Governance involves the provision of essential services to the population by a legitimate central authority in a timely manner. This provision of services can be impacted by such factors as the level of corruption, the viability of the justice system, and the inﬂuence of warlords and tribal militias.25 23 U.S. House of Representatives, Committee on International Relations and U.S. Senate, Committee on Foreign Relations, Legislation on Foreign Relations Through 2000 (Washing- ton, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Oﬃce, 2001), pp. 338–339; Robert M.

A basic need of any insurgent group is an attractive cause. As David Galula argues, “The best cause for the insurgent’s purpose is one that, by deﬁnition, can attract the largest number of supporters and repel the minimum of opponents.”26 All types of problems have been taken advantage of by insurgents. Sometimes the cause is social, such as the exploitation of one class by another. Class exploitation motivated a number of Marxist-Leninist insurgencies in Latin America, Africa, and Asia during the Cold War. Sometimes it is economic. The Chinese Communists capitalized on the plight of Chinese farmers, who were victims of exactions by authorities and the rapacity of local usurers. Poor governance may indicate disorganization, weakness, or incompe- tence—creating a window of opportunity for insurgents to win popu- lar support.27 Corruption can be a particularly invidious challenge. It can under- mine support for the government and increase support for insurgents. Corruption hampers economic growth, disproportionately burdens the poor, undermines the rule of law, and damages government legiti- macy. It has a supply side (those who give bribes) and a demand side (public oﬃcials who take them).28 At its core, corruption is the misuse of entrusted power for private gain. It can involve high-level oﬃcials with discretionary authority over government policies or lower-level oﬃcials who make decisions about enforcing (or not enforcing) regula- tions. Corruption also slows economic growth. It is often responsible for funneling scarce public resources away from projects that bene- ﬁt the society and toward projects that beneﬁt speciﬁc individuals. It hinders the development of markets and distorts competition, thereby petitiveness Report 2005–2006 (Geneva: World Economic Forum, 2005), pp. 81–98; Paris, At War’s End. 26 Galula, Counterinsurgency Warfare, pp. 19–20. 27 World Bank, Reforming Public Institutions and Strengthening Governance (Washington, D.C.: World Bank, 2000); Jessica Einhorn, “The World Bank’s Mission Creep,” Foreign Aﬀairs, Vol. 80, No. 5 (2001), pp. 22–35. 28 Transparency International, Global Corruption Report 2006 (Berlin: Transparency Inter- national, 2006). 20 Counterinsurgency in Afghanistan deterring investment. However, the most damaging eﬀect of corrup- tion is its impact on the social fabric of society: corruption undermines the population’s trust in the political system, political institutions, and political leadership.29 In short, poor governance capacity contributes to declining sup- port for the government, which can be fatal to counterinsurgencies. As Figure 2.4 shows, governments with high popularity defeated most of the insurgencies they fought, while unpopular governments lost more than one-half of the time.30 Figure 2.4 Government Popularity and Success High Low Medium Number of insurgencies RAND MG595-2.4 Popularity of government 25 20 15 10 5 0 Won by government Mixed outcome Lost by government 29 Kaufmann, “Myths and Realities of Governance and Corruption,” pp. 81–98. 30 We assessed the popularity of the government by making a qualitative judgment about how popular it was among the local population. We tried to avoid as much as possible the endogeneity problem of coding the government as popular if it won—and unpopular if it lost. Rather, we relied on the judgments of area specialists and historians that covered each insurgency to determine how popular the government was independent of the insurgency, Success in Counterinsurgency Warfare 21 External Support The ﬁnal factor that impacts a counterinsurgency’s success is external support to insurgents. The ability of insurgent groups to gain external support is correlated with their success. As Figure 2.5 illustrates, those insurgencies that received support from external states won more than 50 percent of the time, those with support from nonstate actors and diaspora groups won just over 30 percent of the time, and those with no external support won only 17 percent of the time.31 Support from state actors and nonstate actors, such as a diaspora population, criminal network, or terrorist network, clearly makes a diﬀerence. This is intutive: Outside Figure 2.5 External Support for Insurgents and Success From states None From nonstate actors Number of insurgencies RAND MG595-2.5 External support 16 14 12 10 8 6 4 2 0 Won by government Mixed outcome Lost by government which included examining public opinion polls where available.

Unpublished RAND research for the U.S. Department of Defense. 22 Counterinsurgency in Afghanistan assistance—especially from states, which tend to have greater resources—can signiﬁcantly bolster the capabilities of insurgent groups by giving them more money, weapons, logistics, and other aid. External support can take two forms. First, foreign governments, diasporas, or international networks can provide direct assistance: training, operations, money, arms, logistics, diplomatic backing, and other types of aid.32 The rise of a transnational jihadist network has cre- ated particularly acute challenges as organizations such as al Qaeda tap into local groups. These challenges include the ﬂow of tactics, weapons, ﬁghters, ideology, organization, and leadership into and among local insurgencies; the increased resort to suicide operations; and the pivotal role of religious ﬁgures in either fanning or opposing violence. Given the basic constraints posed by numerical weakness, insurgents need arms and materiel, money to buy them, or goods to trade for them. They need a supply of recruits, and they may also need information and instruction in the practical details of waging an insurgency. The second type of external support is the freedom to use foreign territory as a sanctuary. This is sometimes made more tenable by the presence of a weak government where there is a sanctuary. The avail- ability of a territorial base for insurgents outside of their home state is correlated with the failure of counterinsurgency eﬀorts.33 As Figure 2.6 illustrates, external sanctuary is a signiﬁcant help to insurgents, often making the diﬀerence between their success or failure.34 Insurgents have been successful approximately 43 percent of the time when they enjoyed a sanctuary. While success in counterinsurgency warfare ultimately hinges on the ability to work with the indigenous government and its security forces, there are often signiﬁcant challenges in doing so. The U.S. mili- tary faces at least two challenges in this area. First, the security forces 32 Daniel L. Byman, Deadly Connections: States That Sponsor Terrorism (New York: Cam- bridge University Press, 2005), pp. 53–78. 33 Fearon and Laitin, “Ethnicity, Insurgency, and Civil War.” 34 We assessed sanctuary using a dichotomous variable: yes if insurgents enjoyed signiﬁcant sanctuary in a neighboring state or no if they had little or no sanctuary. Unpublished RAND research for the U.S. Department of Defense. Success in Counterinsurgency Warfare 23 may be poorly trained or corrupt. As Daniel Byman argues, many U.S. counterinsurgency allies have been characterized by poor intelligence, a lack of initiative, little integration of forces across units, soldiers who do not want to ﬁght, bad leadership, and problems with training and creativity.35 Second, the indigenous government may be illegitimate, incom- petent in providing basic services, weak, or corrupt. At the outset of the Afghan insurgency in 2002, for example, the central government was extremely weak. Afghan territory has historically been controlled by tribes and warlords, and its inhabitants have generally pledged loyalty to those with similar kinship ties and patrilineal descent rather than to the state authority.36 Governance problems such as this can often be diﬃcult to ﬁx, especially in the near term. International assistance can build strong institutions in certain areas, such as central bank- ing, which are isolated from society and responsive to the application 35 Byman, Going to War with the Allies You Have. 36 Rubin, The Fragmentation of Afghanistan, pp. 48–52.

But other areas, such as the justice system, are diﬃcult to strengthen through the application of exter- nal assistance. These institutions have high “transaction volumes,” are more deeply embedded in the social fabric, are an important element of the state’s basis of legitimacy, and are heavily inﬂuenced by the cul- tural norms and values that shape institutions in any society.37 Conse- quently, establishing a viable rule of law is an enormous challenge that can take a long time to accomplish. Conclusion External actors can play an important role in insurgencies and coun- terinsurgencies by tipping the balance in favor of either insurgents or the indigenous government. However, they usually cannot win it for either side, since locals have to govern and establish order over the long run. The indigenous force should be the default force of choice. Even if tactically successful, a unilateral operation by external forces may ultimately lead to failure by undermining and delegitimizing the very indigenous capability the external actor is trying to build.38 Conse- quently, when the United States is involved in counterinsurgency war- fare, the primary focus of its eﬀorts should be to improve the perfor- mance and legitimacy of indigenous actors. This includes improving the quality of the police and other security forces, strengthening gover- nance capacity, and undermining external support for insurgents. The rest of this study will further explore this argument. 37 Francis Fukuyama, State-Building: Governance and World Order in the 21st Century (Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 2004). 38 Walter Herd, World War III: The Global Unconventional War on Terror (Fort Bragg, N.C.: United States Army Special Operations Command, 2005). 25 CHAPTER THREE The Age of Insurgency Insurgencies are not new to Afghanistan. This chapter brieﬂy examines Afghanistan’s recent history of insurgency and argues that governance, the capacity of indigenous security forces, and external support have been critical factors in the outcome of these insurgencies. This ﬁnding has signiﬁcant implications for understanding the resurgence of the Taliban that began in 2002. In 1973, the royal dynasty that had ruled Afghanistan for more than two centuries fell. Mohammed Daoud deposed his brother-in- law, King Zahir Shah, and declared Afghanistan a republic. Daoud became president, abolished the monarchy, and forced Zahir Shah into exile in Rome. Marxist army oﬃcers helped consolidate Daoud’s position, although this process was hampered by splits between the two main communist factions in Afghanistan: Khalq [the masses] and Parcham [the ﬂag]. In 1978, Khalq army oﬃcers engineered a bloody coup, which led to the death of Daoud and his replacement by Nur Mohammad Taraki. Violence between the rival factions—including the murder of Taraki—coincided with wider rural revolts by Islamist opponents of the communist regime. Moscow grew increasingly con- cerned about the deteriorating security situation and feared that Tara- ki’s successor, Haﬁzullah Amin, would turn to the West for assistance. Thus began Afghanistan’s age of insurgency. 26 Counterinsurgency in Afghanistan A Legacy of War Over the next three decades, Afghanistan experienced at least four major insurgencies: the mujahideen wars against the Soviet Union (1979–1994), the rise of the Taliban (1994–2001), the U.S.-backed overthrow of the Taliban regime (2001–2002), and the return of the Taliban (2002–present). The objective of each of these insurgencies was to overthrow the existing regime and replace it with one more palat- able to insurgent forces and their state sponsors. Many of the insurgent leaders—including Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, Abdul Rashid Dostum, Jalaluddin Haqqani, and Mullah Mohammed Omar—played key roles in most or all of the insurgencies. The Mujahideen Period In December 1979, the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan, overthrew the Afghan government, and installed Babrak Karmal as leader. But a disparate collection of mujahideen insurgent groups resisted the Soviet occupation. The Soviets were successful in controlling the major cities and provincial towns in the country, but they never managed to take control of the countryside. Indeed, the situation in rural areas wors- ened for the Soviets and the Afghan government as mujahideen forces steadily gained popular support. Support for the mujahideen from Pakistan was a critical variable. Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence Directorate (ISI) provided money, weapons, training, and other assis- tance to Afghan insurgent groups, funneling aid to the mujahideen from a variety of other countries such as the United States and Saudi Arabia. Pakistan also provided sanctuary to mujahideen groups, where they were generally safe from Soviet forces.1 Soviet losses mounted steadily, despite the Soviets’ repeated eﬀorts to defeat the mujahideen through the widespread deployment of mines, carpet-bombing of rebel areas, and the use of scorched-earth tactics.2 1 Steve Coll, Ghost Wars: The Secret History of the CIA, Afghanistan, and bin Laden, from the Soviet Invasion to September 10, 2001 (New York: Penguin Books, 2004). 2 Lester Grau, ed., The Bear Went Over the Mountain: Soviet Combat Tactics in Afghanistan (Washington, D.C.: National Defense University Press, 1996); Lester Grau, Artillery and The Age of Insurgency 27 In November 1986, Mohammad Najibullah was elected president of Afghanistan. He attempted to introduce a “national reconciliation” program, but with little success. When the Soviets withdrew in Febru- ary 1989, the country was devastated. An estimated 1 million Afghans had been killed, more than 5 million had ﬂed abroad, and 2–3 mil- lion were internally displaced. Nearly 15,000 Soviet soldiers had been killed, and as many as 500,000 had become sick or were wounded.3 The Soviet withdrawal raised hopes both within Afghanistan and abroad for an imminent end to the conﬂict. However, ﬁghting con- tinued as the former anti-Soviet mujahideen coalition splintered along ethnic and political lines into competing factions. As a result of this in-ﬁghting among the mujahideen forces, the pro-Moscow regime of President Najibullah was able to cling to power for three years after the Soviet withdrawal. In April 1992, Kabul ﬁnally fell to elements of the mujahideen, who then established a new government for the renamed the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. Mujahideen leaders agreed to introduce a rotating presidency, starting with Burhanuddin Rabbani. However, disputes broke out over the division of government posts, and the ﬁghting ﬂared again. Pashtun leaders were particularly con- cerned about the makeup of the government and resented having to hand power over to other ethnic groups after more than 250 years of uninterrupted Pashtun rule.4 The Rise of the Taliban By 1994, Afghanistan had disintegrated into a patchwork of compet- ing groups and shifting alliances. The predominantly ethnic Tajik gov- ernment of President Rabbani held Kabul and the northeast of the country, while the northern provinces remained under the control of Counterinsurgency: The Soviet Experience in Afghanistan (Fort Leavenworth, Kan.: Foreign Military Studies Oﬃce, 1997). 3 Ahmed Rashid, Taliban: Militant Islam, Oil and Fundamentalism in Central Asia (New Haven, Conn.: Yale University Press, 2000), p. 13; Barnett R.

Ismail Khan controlled the western provinces around Herat, and the area to the south and east of Kabul were in the hands of warlords such as Gulbuddin Hekmatyar. The eastern border with Pakistan was held by a council of mujahideen, and the south was split between scores of ex-mujahideen and bandits, who used their control of the roads to extort money from the cross- border trade with Pakistan. In late 1994, a new movement emerged in the south, seizing con- trol ﬁrst of Kandahar and then of the surrounding provinces. Its lead- ers took the name of their group, Taliban, from the plural of talib, an Arabic word denoting an Islamic student. Many members were drawn from madrassas (Islamic theology schools) that had been established in Afghan refugee camps in northeastern Pakistan during the 1980s. The Taliban leadership, headed by Mullah Omar, presented itself as a cleansing force that would rid the country of the factionalism, corrup- tion, and violence that had predominated since the Soviet withdrawal. Due to frustration and war-weariness among the population in the south, the Taliban was initially well received. Its forces advanced rap- idly through southern and eastern Afghanistan, capturing nine out of thirty provinces by February 1995. The movement received strong back- ing from Pakistan’s ISI, which assisted in the recruitment of members and provided weapons, training, and technical assistance.5 In 1996, the Taliban captured Kabul and, despite temporary setbacks, conquered the northern cities of Mazar, Kunduz, and Taloqan in 1998. By 2001, the Taliban controlled virtually all of Afghanistan. The only exception was a small sliver of land northeast of Kabul in the Pan- shjir Valley to which Ahmed Shah Massoud and his Northern Alli- ance forces had retreated. The Taliban instituted a repressive version of shari’a law, banning music, banned women from working or going to school, and prohibited freedom of the press. Afghanistan also became a breeding ground for jihadists and terrorists intent on attacking the United States and other nations. Osama bin Laden and his al Qaeda network used their money and inﬂuence to support the Taliban regime 5 Coll, Ghost Wars, pp. 291–296, 331–332, 348, 414, 458. The Age of Insurgency 29 and, in return, received permission to train operatives and plan opera- tions on Afghan soil.6 Operation Enduring Freedom After the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in Washington, New York, and Pennsylvania, the United States military launched Oper- ation Enduring Freedom, helping Northern Alliance forces led by Abdul Rashid Dostum, Atta Mohammad Nur, Mohammad Qasim Fahim, and other local commanders mount a successful insurgency against the Taliban.7 Over the next several months, U.S. and Afghan forces conducted a series of oﬀensive operations, such as Operation Anaconda in the Shah-i-kot valley of eastern Afghanistan, against Tali- ban and al Qaeda forces.8 The result was that most Taliban, al Qaeda, and other foreign jihadists resettled across the border in Pakistan. Although ﬁghting continued for several years, the United States and other international actors began to assist Afghanistan with reconstruc- tion by December 2001. As the Taliban’s power base collapsed, international and local attention turned to nation-building. The UN helped organize a meet- ing of Afghan political leaders in Bonn, Germany, in late November 2001. On December 5, 2001, Afghan leaders signed the Bonn Agree- ment. It established a timetable for a transition to legitimate power structures, which culminated in the establishment of a fully representa- tive and freely elected government. The UN Security Council endorsed 6 The 9/11 Commission Report: Final Report of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States (New York: W. W.

The parties present at Bonn had also asked the United Nations to “monitor and assist in the implementation of all aspects” of the agreement.11 To that end, Security Council Reso- lution 1401, passed on March 28, 2002, established the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA). In addition, the United Kingdom agreed to be the lead nation for counternarcotics, Italy for justice, the United States for the army, Germany for police, and Japan for the disar- mament, demobilization, and reintegration of former combatants. The Emergency Loya Jirga, which was attended by approximately 2,000 people, took place between June 12 and 19, 2002, following extensive preparations and countrywide consultations. At the conclusion, Hamid Karzai was chosen as president of the transitional administration and head of state. His nominees for key posts in the administration were also approved by the Emergency Loya Jirga. The defense and foreign aﬀairs portfolios were given to the mainly Tajik Northern Alliance, while the Ministry of Interior went to a Pashtun regional governor. The Return of the Taliban In the spring and summer of 2002, Taliban and other forces began to conduct oﬀensive operations to overthrow the Afghan government and coerce the withdrawal of U.S. and coalition forces.12 In April, for exam- 9 United Nations Security Council Resolution 1383, S/RES/1383, December 6, 2001. 10 A loya jirga is a traditional meeting of Afghan tribal, political, and religious leaders. 11 United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, “Agreement on Provisional Arrange- ments in Afghanistan Pending the Reestablishment of Permanent Government Institutions,” December 2001. 12 Some have argued that the insurgency began in earnest in June 2004. But Taliban oﬀen- sive operations two years earlier suggest that it was in the spring of 2002. COL Walter M. The Age of Insurgency 31 ple, Taliban and jihadist forces conducted a series of oﬀensive attacks in Kandahar, Khowst, Nangarhar, Kabul, and other Afghan prov- inces. This marked the beginning of the latest insurgency. After 2002, insurgent groups waged an increasingly violent campaign in Afghani- stan despite political progress. In January 2004, for example, Afghans adopted a new constitution. In October 2004, they elected Hamid Karzai as president, despite eﬀorts by the Taliban and other insurgent groups to target those involved in the election. In September 2005, Afghans elected a new parliament, which included a number of ex- Taliban ministers. At least several individuals formerly associated with the Taliban won Wolesi Jirga (lower house of the National Assembly) seats in the September 2005 elections, including Abdul Salam Rocketi. President Karzai appointed the former Taliban deputy religious aﬀairs minister, Mawlawi Arsallah Rahmani, to the Meshrano Jirga (upper house) along with Gulbuddin Hekmatyar’s former close ally, Abdul Saboor Farid.13 Despite these steps, however, the insurgency continued to worsen. Key Themes This brief overview of Afghanistan’s age of insurgency highlights three factors that have contributed to the success of past insurgencies: gov- ernance challenges, external support, and variations in the quality of security forces. Governance Afghanistan has a long history of decentralized governance. Following the second Anglo-Afghan war in 1880, Amir Abdul Rahman Khan seized power after the departure of British troops.

However, Khan was unable to destroy tribal power and establish a strong, centrally controlled state.14 Successive eﬀorts over the next century generally failed. Afghan terri- tory has been controlled by tribes and local strongmen, and its inhabit- ants have generally pledged loyalty to those with similar kinship ties and patrilineal descent rather than to a central governing authority.15 One consequence of this power structure is that Afghan governments have never been able to establish a monopoly on the legitimate use of force inside the country. The insurgencies that began with the 1979 Soviet invasion and continued through the Taliban conquests in the 1990s only served to increase Afghanistan’s decentralized political structure. In addition, Afghan governments have never established a formal jus- tice system. In the absence of a central government, local shuras (vil- lage councils) and tribal elders developed an informal legal system that incorporated a wide range of Islamic and customary laws.16 External Support State support and sanctuary have been critical variables in the outcome of these insurgencies. Afghan governments and opposition groups have received aid from a number of states. The Soviet Union provided a total of $1.3 billion in economic aid and $1.3 billion in military aid to the Afghan government between 1955 and 1978 and roughly $5 billion per year between 1979 and 1989. The United States provided $533 million in economic aid to the Afghan government between 1955 and 1978, and between $4 billion and $5 billion to the mujahideen between 1980 14 Rubin, The Fragmentation of Afghanistan, pp. 48–52. 15 Richard Tapper, “Anthropologists, Historians, and Tribespeople on Tribe and State For- mation in the Middle East,” in Philip S.

The Age of Insurgency 33 and 1992.17 Both the United States and the Soviet Union suspended most aid in 1991. The Pakistan government, especially the ISI, played a particularly active role in Afghan politics. Pakistan provided signiﬁcant assistance to the mujahideen during the Soviet wars. And it provided weapons, ﬁnancial aid, and other assistance such as wheat and petro- leum to the Taliban and other groups from the 1990s through 2001.18 Saudi Arabia gave nearly $4 billion in oﬃcial aid to the mujahideen between 1980 and 1990; there was also a ﬂow of unoﬃcial aid from Saudi Islamic charities and foundations, the private funds of Saudi princes, and mosque collections. Saudi Arabia provided aid to the Tali- ban and al Qaeda in Afghanistan until 1998.19 Finally, Iran provided assistance to various factions, especially to Afghan commanders in the western regions of the country. Iranian military aid to the anti-Taliban alliance escalated after the fall of Kabul in 1996 and again after the fall of Mazar in 1998. Security Forces Afghanistan’s history of weak central governments and the ﬂow of support from external actors impacted eﬀorts to establish strong cen- tral government forces. During the 1980s and 1990s, there was no national civilian police force in Afghanistan. Instead, local militia and tribal forces enforced the rule of law in much of the country. Among the Pashtun (who constitute a majority of Afghanistan’s population), the traditional military institution has been the lashkar, or the armed tribe. Each family contributed male members and weapons to the lash- kar, which was further enriched by whatever material it took in battle. 17 Rashid, Taliban, p. 18; Rubin, The Fragmentation of Afghanistan, p. 20. 18 Tim Judah, “The Taliban Papers,” Survival, Vol. 44, No. 1 (Spring 2002), pp. 69–80; Rubin, The Fragmentation of Afghanistan, pp. 196–225; Ahmed Rashid, “Pakistan and the Taliban,” in William Maley, ed., Fundamentalism Reborn?

Estimates during the 1990s ranged from about 200,000 to 600,000.20 Most were untrained, ill-equipped, illiterate, and owed their allegiance to local warlords and military commanders, not to the central government.21 As a German delegation in January 2002 concluded The police force is in a deplorable state just a few months after the dissolution of the Taliban regime. There is a total lack of equip- ment and supplies. No systematic training has been provided for about 20 years. At least one entire generation of trained police oﬃcers is missing. Next to constables, former Northern Alliance ﬁghters are being put to work as police oﬃcers.22 While Afghanistan has lacked a trained civilian police force, it has had secret police agencies. During the Soviet era, the Afghan gov- ernment established a powerful secret police body, the State Informa- tion Services, to suppress opponents of the regime and establish order. The Taliban established the Ministry of Enforcement of Virtue and Suppression of Vice to enforce decrees regarding moral behavior, such as those restricting women’s employment, education, and dress; enforc- ing men’s beard length and mosque attendance; and regulating the activities of the United Nations and NGOs.23 The Afghan army has traditionally had little internal control over the country. During the 1980s, the Moscow-backed Democratic Republic of Afghanistan and its successor, the Republic of Afghani- stan, recruited a large number of tribal and local militias as army forces. 20 Ali A.

The Age of Insurgency 35 During the Taliban era, the army was comprised of an assortment of armed groups with varying degrees of loyalties and professional skills. There was no formal military structure. The army was not organized, armed, or commanded by the state.24 Mullah Mohammed Omar was commander of the armed forces and ultimately decided on military strategies, key appointments, and military budgets. A military shura sat below Omar, helping to plan strategy and implement tactical decisions. Individual Taliban commanders were responsible for recruiting men, paying them, and looking after their needs in the ﬁeld. These ﬁeld commanders acquired much of the money, fuel, food, transport, and weapons they needed from the military shura. The Taliban’s military structure also included Pakistani oﬃcers and al Qaeda members. For example, the elite Brigade 055 consisted of Pakistani, Sudanese, and other foreign ﬁghters.25 Conclusion This overview reiterates the argument laid out in Chapter Two: Gov- ernance challenges, external support, and the capacity of indigenous security forces have been critical factors in the outcome of Afghani- stan’s insurgencies. Pakistan played two particularly important roles. First, the Pakistan government, especially the ISI, supported the victors of each insurgency: the mujahideen, Taliban, and U.S. forces during the initial stages of Operation Enduring Freedom. Since Afghanistan and Pakistan share a 1,160-mile border, Pakistani leaders have histori- cally viewed the ability to inﬂuence Afghanistan as critical for strategic depth. Second, Afghan insurgent groups have repeatedly used Paki- stan as a sanctuary. These ﬁndings have signiﬁcant implications for understanding the Taliban’s resurgence and assessing how they can be defeated. The next three chapters will explore these ﬁndings and their implications by focusing on the three key actors: insurgents, the 24 Jalali, “Afghanistan.” 25 Rashid, Taliban, pp. 98–100. 36 Counterinsurgency in Afghanistan Afghan government and its security forces, and the United States and other coalition partners. 37 CHAPTER FOUR Insurgents and Their Support Network This chapter examines Afghan insurgent groups and their support network in the early stages of the insurgency. It argues that a critical independent variable in the success of any counterinsurgency is outside support for insurgents. The insurgency in Afghanistan included a dan- gerous combination of local and transnational support. Afghan groups successfully acquired external support and assistance from the global jihadist network, including groups with a strong foothold in Pakistan, such as al Qaeda. They also acquired support from some individu- als in the Pakistan government, as well as local tribes, criminal orga- nizations, and militias in Pakistan and Afghanistan. This assistance enabled Afghan insurgent groups to adapt their tactics, techniques, and procedures—to become, in eﬀect, learning organizations—and largely explains the resurgence of the Taliban and other insurgent forces. This chapter is divided into four sections. The ﬁrst outlines the main insurgent groups. The second examines their increasing ability to conduct violence. The third section assesses why they have been suc- cessful in destabilizing the south and east, especially their ability to gain external support. The fourth oﬀers a brief conclusion. Insurgent Groups The insurgency in Afghanistan included six main insurgent groups: the Taliban, Hezb-i-Islami, the Haqqani network, foreign ﬁghters (mostly Arabs and Central Asians), tribes based in Pakistan and Afghanistan, and criminal networks. There is evidence of some coordination among 38 Counterinsurgency in Afghanistan these groups at the tactical, operational, and strategic levels—including through several shuras located in Pakistan.1 But there was no uniﬁed leadership. As Figure 4.1 illustrates, Afghan insurgent groups fell into three loose fronts. The northern front, which included a large Hezb-i- Islami presence, was based in Afghan provinces that include Nurestan, Konar, Laghman, and Nangarhar, as well as across the border in Paki- stan. Other groups, such as Lashkar-e-Taiba and Tehreek-e-Nefaz-e- Shariat-Mohammadi, were also active on this front. The central front included a loose amalgam of foreign ﬁghters, including Central Asians and Arabs. They were located in a swath of territory near the Afghani- stan-Pakistan border from Bajaur in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas in Pakistan to Khowst, Paktia, and Paktika in Afghanistan. The Haqqani network was active in the central front against Afghan and coalition forces. Finally, the southern front, which included a large Tal- iban presence, was based in Baluchistan and the Federally Adminis- tered Tribal Areas of Pakistan, as well around the Afghan provinces of Helmand, Kandahar, Oruzgan, Zabol, and Paktika. In addition to the Taliban, several drug and tribal groups were also active in the southern front. The Taliban The Taliban have historically been motivated to impose a radical inter- pretation of Sunni Islam in Afghanistan, which is derived from the Deobandi school of thought.2 Their primary strategies for accomplish- ing this objective have long been to overthrow the Afghan government, break the political will of the United States and its coalition partners, 1 On cooperation among insurgents, see Barnett R.

As former Taliban spokesman Mofti Latifollah Hakimi argued, “the only avenue open to us is the path of jihad.”3 Indeed, the Taliban increasingly adopted jihadist rheto- ric to reestablish control of the country. Th e Taliban included a recent inﬂ ux of new members—sometimes referred to as the “neo-Taliban”— who were recruited at madrassas and other locations in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Th ere were several thousand full-time Taliban ﬁ ghters; some estimates ranged from 5,000 to 10,000.4 3 “Spokesman Rejects Afghan Government’s Amnesty Oﬀ er for Taliban Leader,” Peshawar Afghan Islamic Press (May 9, 2005). 4 Estimates of insurgents are notoriously diﬃ cult for two reasons. First, it is diﬃ cult to count the number of insurgents since they hide in urban and rural areas to evade foreign and domestic intelligence and security forces. Second, the number of insurgents is often ﬂ uid. Some are full-time ﬁ ghters, but many are not. In addition, there is a signiﬁ cant logistics, Figure 4.1 The Afghan Insurgent Front Kandahar Helmand Nimruz Farah Herat Badghis Ghor Daykundi Bamiyan Sar-e Pol Faryab Jowzjan Balkh Samangan Baghlan Kunduz Takhar Badakhshan Ghazni Jowzjan Paktika Zabul Orūzgān Wardak Nangarhar Kapisa Parwan Kunar Laghman Panjshir Lowgar Kabul Afghanistan Pakistan Turkmenistan Iran Iran Tajikistan Uzbekistan Khost Paktia Nurestan RAND MG595-4.1 Northern Front (Hezb-i-Islami) Central Front (Foreign ﬁghters and the Haqqani network) Southern Front (Taliban and criminal groups) 40 Counterinsurgency in Afghanistan The Taliban has traditionally involved two main tiers. The top tier included the leadership structure and key military and political guerril- las and commanders. They were motivated by a radical version of Islam and saw the insurgency as a ﬁght between Islam and Western inﬁdels and the West’s “puppet government” in Kabul. The Taliban leadership was comprised of Mullah Omar and his senior lieutenants, many of whom were based in Quetta, Pakistan.5 A second shura was based in Pakistan’s Federally Administered Tribal Areas and revolved around such individuals as Sirajuddin Haqqani, who commanded several hun- dred ﬁghters and was loosely allied with Taliban leadership.6 His base of support was in the Afghan provinces of Khowst, Logar, Paktia, and Paktika, as well as in Waziristan.7 Haqqani cooperated with the Paki- stan government, including the military and ISI. He enjoyed a support base and ran madrassas in and around Miranshah and Mir Ali.8 In addition, the Taliban organized a parallel Afghan government, which ﬁnancial, and political support network for insurgent groups, making it virtually impossible to reliably estimate the total number of guerrillas and their support base. These reasons make it more diﬃcult to estimate the number of insurgents than to estimate the size of state mili- tary forces. On the Taliban numbers, the author interviewed U.S., European, and Afghan oﬃcials on numerous occasions throughout 2004, 2005, and 2006. 5 There is an extensive body of literature on the Taliban’s base of operations in Pakistan; see, for example, Jason Burke, “The New Taliban,” Observer (London), October 14, 2007, p. 31; Barnett R.

Insurgents and Their Support Network 41 included governors for Afghan provinces and ministers for such areas as defense and justice.9 The bottom tier of Taliban guerrillas included thousands of local Afghan ﬁghters. They were primarily men from rural villages who were paid to set up roadside bombs, launch rockets and mortars at NATO and Afghan forces, or pick up a gun for a few days. Most were not ideo- logically committed to jihad. Rather, they were motivated by unem- ployment, disenchantment with the lack of change since 2001, or anger over the killing or wounding of a local villager by Afghan, U.S., or NATO forces. Some fought because of grievances with the Afghan government or because of abuse (either actual or perceived) by Afghan or coalition forces—such as bombings and intrusive house searches. Hezb-i-Islami Gulbuddin Hekmatyar’s Hezb-i-Islami, which included several hun- dred ﬁghters, sought to overthrow the government of Afghanistan and install Hekmatyar as leader.10 Hekmatyar is a Pashtun from the Imam Sahib district of Kunduz and served as Afghanistan’s prime minister from March 1993 to 1994 and again brieﬂy in 1996. His group has tra- ditionally found support in the areas around the Afghan provinces of Konar, Nurestan, Nangarhar, Paktia, and Paktika.11 The Hezb-i-Islami has historically received assistance from the Iran and Pakistan govern- ments, as well as the United States during the Cold War.12 Hekmatyar openly pledged to cooperate with al Qaeda and Taliban forces to ﬁght the “crusader forces” in Afghanistan.13 Both the Taliban and Hezb-i-Islami had loosely hierarchical organizational structures and were roughly divided into four groups: logistics support, ﬁnancial and political support, guerrillas, and com- 9 Amrullah Saleh, Strategy of Insurgents and Terrorists in Afghanistan (Kabul: National Directorate for Security, 2006), p. 2. 10 Author interview with U.S. government oﬃcials, Kabul, Afghanistan, September 2006. 11 Saleh, Strategy of Insurgents and Terrorists in Afghanistan, p. 2. 12 On Hekmatyar’s relationship with Pakistan, see Coll, Ghost Wars, pp. 181–183, 210–211. 13 See, for example, “Al Jazeera Airs Hikmatyar Video,” Al Jazeera TV, May 4, 2006. 42 Counterinsurgency in Afghanistan manders.14 The logistics support network provided supplies, equip- ment, and other assistance.15 The success or failure of the guerrilla force depends to a great extent on the logistics support network’s ability to gain support from the tribal populations in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Individuals in this group assisted the insurgency by acquiring supplies (including food, water, and ammunition), conducting information and intelligence campaigns, operating medical facilities, conducting counter intelligence operations, recruiting new guerrillas or supporters, operating communication systems, and acquiring and maintaining equipment. The ﬁnancial and political support network was focused on acquiring money and other types of assistance from government and nongovernment sources, and establishing political relations with friendly governments, tribal leaders, and other groups. It also worked to recruit new members from madrassas, tribes, and foreign countries. The guerrillas were the armed insurgents, who conducted military and paramilitary operations. Insurgent groups also paid locals—especially youths—to conduct low-level operations, such as harassing ﬁre at U.S. or coalition forces. The Taliban often paid these local youths two or three times the daily rate of pay of ANA and ANP units, suggest- ing that some insurgents were motivated more by ﬁnancial than ideo- logical incentives.16 Finally, the commanders provided strategic orga- nization. Commanders did not exert control in traditional military terms. Rather, guerrilla units were often given tactical and operational autonomy.17 14 Herd et al., One Valley at a Time, pp. 67–76. 15 Key Afghan cities for the support network include those along the ring road, such as Kabul, Jalalabad, Ghazni, Gardez, Qalat, Kandahar, and Herat. In addition, the main aux- iliary lines include the old trade routes and way stations that connect Afghanistan cities to Iran and Afghanistan. Examples include the old Silk Road to Tehran, Pepper Route through Peshawar and on to India, route through the Khyber Pass to Peshawar, and route from Spin Boldak to Quetta. 16 In the summer of 2006, for example, U.S. and NATO military oﬃcials reported that the Taliban paid locals in some areas roughly $14 per day to ﬁght, compared to approximately $4 for many ANA soldiers. 17 Herd et al., One Valley at a Time, pp. 67–76. When the Taliban fell from power, Haqqani told local reporters, Insurgents and Their Support Network 43 Foreign Fighters The foreign ﬁghters assisting the Afghan insurgents were an amalgam of loosely knit Muslim extremists, including al Qaeda forces. Their ranks were made up primarily of two major types: individuals from the Caucasus and Central Asia (such as Chechens, Uzbeks, and Tajiks) and Arabs (such as Saudis, Egyptians, and Libyans). Several waves of Arabs settled in Waziristan during the mujahideen wars against the Soviets and, more recently, after the U.S. and Northern Alliance overthrow of the Taliban regime. A number of foreigners were directly or indi- rectly aﬃliated with al Qaeda, though some were simply inspired by the broader jihadist goal of pushing the United States and its Western allies out of Afghanistan.18 Al Qaeda played an important role as an enabler of the Taliban and had close relations with several Pakistan militant groups such as Jaish e Muhammad, Harakat ul Mujahideen, Lashkar e Jhangvi, and Harakat ul Jihad ul Islami. Key al Qaeda ﬁgures involved in the Afghanistan insurgency included Ayman al-Zawahiri t Mustafa Abu al-Yazid t Abu Yahya al-Libi t Adam Gadahn. t Indeed, the Afghan-border region of Pakistan was home to what is generally referred to as “al Qaeda central”—the remnants of the We will retreat to the mountains and begin a long guerrilla war to reclaim our pure land from inﬁdels and free our country like we did against the Soviets . . . we are eagerly awaiting the American troops to land on our soil, where we will deal with them in our own way.

First forged during the Afghan jihad of the 1980s, these relationships were institutionalized in the late 1990s when al Qaeda trained and catalogued tens of thou- sands of Pakistani militants in camps inside Afghanistan. Al Qaeda was deeply involved in suicide terrorism, which will be discussed in more detail below. For example, Croma Yahya, a suicide bomber from Mali who failed to kill Balkh governor Atta Mohammad Nur, had al Qaeda links and came to Afghanistan through Pakistan.20 As Lt. General Michael Maples, head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, argued, “Al Qaeda will remain engaged in Afghanistan for ideological and operational reasons. Taliban and other anti-coalition militants are adopting al Qaeda tactics in Afghanistan.”21 The map in Figure 4.2 illustrates Pakistan’s tribal areas, which stretch for 500 miles along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. The for- eign ﬁghters often acted as franchises to al Qaeda. They had auton- omy at the tactical and operational level but often took guidance from more senior al Qaeda or other commanders at the strategic level. Their strategic objectives were much broader than those embraced by Hezb-i-Islami and Taliban forces. They adopted a strict interpreta- tion of Islam, embraced jihad against the U.S. and other allied gov- ernments, and sought to eradicate Western military forces and inﬂu- 19 Al Qaeda today can be conceptualized in several dimensions. The ﬁrst includes al Qaeda aﬃliates and associates. These are terrorist groups that have directly beneﬁted from Osama bin Laden’s spiritual guidance and received substantial training, arms, money, and other assistance. The second includes amorphous groups of al Qaeda adherents, who may have received some training in al Qaeda facilities, some encouragement and direction, and per- haps a minimal amount of assistance. The third dimension includes homegrown Islamic radicals who have no direct connection with al Qaeda but who nonetheless are prepared to carry out attacks in solidarity with al Qaeda’s radical jihadist agenda. The ﬁnal dimension is al Qaeda central.

Foreign jihadists were often better equipped, trained, and motivated than other insurgent forces, and played a key role as trainers, shock troops, and surrogate leaders for Taliban units in the ﬁeld.23 Tribes There were a number of Afghan and Pakistan tribes—especially Pash- tun tribes—that allied with insurgent groups and provided assistance to the insurgency. For example, the Taliban had a signiﬁcant sup- port network among the Ghilzai tribes, as well as among such Dur- rani tribes as the Norzais, Alekozai, and Eshaqzais. There were also a number of groups, such as Ahmadzai Wazirs and Mahsuds in North and South Waziristan, that coordinated activities for and provided support to insurgent groups. As one Afghan National Directorate for Security report argued, [The Taliban’s use of] recruitment techniques in the ongoing stage is becoming sophisticated. They approach tribes, sub-tribes and communities in the villages. They want them to sever their relationship with the government and also preach to the popula- tion to support the jihad against the Americans and the govern- ment which they consider the inﬁdel.24 Several individuals in the Ahmedzai Wazir tribe based in Wana, Paki- stan, helped raise funds and recruited militants to ﬁght in Afghanistan. There was also evidence that organizations such as Jamaat-e-Islami and 22 On salaﬁ jihadists, see Gilles Kepel, Jihad: The Trail of Political Islam (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 2002), pp. 219–222; Guilain Denoeux, “The Forgotten Swamp: Navigating Political Islam,” Middle East Policy, Vol. IX, No. 2 (June 2002), pp. 69–71. 23 There have been a handful of cases in which foreign ﬁghters have charged ﬁre bases and special forces camps in the open in virtual suicide missions. Some of these tactics have raised questions about the competence of at least some foreign ﬁghters. 24 Saleh, Strategy of Insurgents and Terrorists in Afghanistan, p. 3. Insurgents and Their Support Network 47 Wahhabi groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba cooperated with insurgent groups.25 Criminal Groups A variety of organizations involved in the illicit drug trade also coop- erated with the Taliban, especially in such Afghan provinces as Hel- mand. In many cases, members of the Afghan government—including the ANP—were also involved in narcotics traﬃcking. Former Afghan Minister of Interior Ali Jalali argued that rising narcotics-related vio- lence “is more indicative of a change in tactics than capability,” includ- ing “closer cooperation between the militants and drug-traﬃckers (particularly in Helmand Province).”26 Drug and other criminal groups developed an intricate network to transport drugs between Afghani- stan and neighboring states. The Taliban proﬁted from the drug trade in several ways. They received payments to provide protection to some drug- traﬃcking organizations operating in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Taliban also levied taxes on some farmers and secured bribes from drug-traﬃcking groups at checkpoints.27 Farther north, there were a number of Russian, Tajik, Uzbek, and Turkmen drug-traﬃcking orga- nizations. Tajikistan has historically been a primary transshipment country for opiate shipments destined for Russia. Drug traﬃckers in Afghanistan used produce-laden trucks as a cover for drugs sent north toward Tajikistan, where they were handed oﬀ to other criminal orga- nizations. Tajik criminal organizations were the primary movers of this contraband. Approximately half of the heroin that passed through 25 On Ismail, see “Taliban Claim Shooting Down U.S. Helicopter,” The News (Islamabad), June 29, 2005.

The balance transited Russia to other consumer markets in Western and Eastern Europe.28 In places where the local economy was dominated by drug traﬃck- ers, the opium poppy economy ﬁnanced a mode of local government that undermined the power of the central government.29 Researchers at the World Bank argued that areas of Afghanistan—particularly in the south—became a fragmented narco-state in which local drug lords took control of district- and provincial-level state institutions of government with the assistance of insurgent groups.30 In short, the opium industry has become increasingly powerful and institutionalized in Afghanistan “as Afghan traﬃckers and the armed leaders who proﬁt from them— both warlords within the government and anti- government forces— capture a higher proportion of the value added of the opiate trade.”31 Insurgent Activity From the beginning of the current Afghan insurgency in 2002, there was a gradual deterioration in the security environment—especially in the south and east of the country. RAND data show that the over- all number of insurgent-initiated attacks increased approximately 400 percent from 2002 to 2006, and the number of deaths from these attacks increased over 800 percent during the same period.32 The data 28 Tandy, Statement. 29 Jan Koehler, Conﬂict Processing and the Opium Poppy Economy in Afghanistan (Jalalabad: Project for Alternative Livelihoods, June 2005), p. 85.

Following are the yearly ﬁgures on insur- gent-initiated attacks in Afghanistan: 2002 (65 attacks); 2003 (148 attacks); 2004 (146 attacks); 2005 (207 attacks); 2006 (353 attacks).

The U.S. military reported that the increase in violence was particularly acute between 2005 and 2006. During this period, the number of suicide attacks increased by more than 400 percent (from 27 to 139), remotely detonated bomb- ings more than doubled (from 783 to 1,677), and armed attacks nearly tripled (from 1,558 to 4,542).33 In 2007, insurgent-initiated violence rose another 27 percent from 2006 levels. Helmand Province witnessed among the highest levels of violence, with a 60-percent rise between 2006 and 2007.34 The result was a lack of security for Afghans and for- eigners, especially those living in the east and south. Road travel in many areas was dangerous, and crime was a major problem. Interfactional— or “green-on-green”—ﬁghting continued among regional commanders, including those in the provinces of Herat, Nangarhar, Nuristan, Logar, Laghman, and Badghis. As one report by the National Directorate for Security concluded, Taliban cells in the south of Afghanistan developed good intelligence about individuals in villages and towns, Individuals who ﬂirt with the government truly get frightened as the Afghan security forces are currently incapable of providing police and protection for each village . . . . When villagers and rural communities seek protection from police either it arrives late or arrives in a wrong way.35 Promoting disorder among the population is a key objective of most insurgents. Disrupting the economy and decreasing security helps (755 deaths). A comparison of the RAND-MIPT data with U.S. and European government data shows that the RAND-MIPT data signiﬁcantly understate the number of attacks and deaths, since most improvised explosive device (IED) and armed attacks were never reported in the press. Nevertheless, the trend in the RAND-MIPT data is consistent with U.S. and European government data. 33 Pamela Constable, “Gates Visits Kabul, Cites Rise in Cross-Border Attacks,” Washington Post, January 17, 2007, p.

Once insurgents establish a hold over the population, those who are hostile to the insurgents often become too fearful to oppose them. Some may be eliminated, providing an exam- ple to others. Some may escape abroad. Still others may be cowed into hiding their true feelings. By threatening the population, the insur- gents give individuals a strong rationale to refuse or refrain from coop- erating with the indigenous government and external actors.36 As learning organizations, insurgent groups were successful at continually adapting their tactics, techniques, and procedures to con- front counterinsurgency eﬀorts.37 They conducted a wide variety of attacks against U.S., coalition, and Afghan security forces, as well as Afghan and international civilians. The insurgents relied heavily on asymmetric tactics, some of which were similar to those used by muja- hideen forces against Soviet and Democratic Republic of Afghanistan army forces during the Soviet-Afghan war.38 Insurgent tactics included yielding the population centers to U.S. and Afghan forces, operating from rural areas, distributing propaganda to the local population and opposition forces, threatening and intimidating the local population, and conducting armed attacks. As Taliban military oﬃcials argued, this is classic guerrilla warfare: “Our military tactic is to control a dis- trict center, kill the government soldiers there, and withdraw to our 36 Galula, Counterinsurgency Warfare, pp. 11–12, 78–79. 37 On terrorism and learning, see Brian A.

Insur- gent groups, especially the Taliban, also succeeded in capturing gov- ernment installations, villages, and district centers in the south, though usually for brief periods. Taliban forces deployed in larger numbers over time, especially in such southern provinces as Helmand. In 2002, they operated in squad-size units. In 2005, they operated in company-sized units of up to 100 or more ﬁghters. By 2008, they occasionally operated in battal- ion-sized units, though they deployed in smaller units as well.41 This suggests that the Taliban were able to move around with more freedom in the south without being targeted by Afghan or coalition forces as time wore on. They also shifted from hard targets, such as U.S. forces, to soft targets, such as Afghan police and international personnel per- ceived to be supporting the Afghan government or coalition forces. Examples include Afghans organizing or otherwise involved in election work, NGO workers, ANP, ANA, and Afghan citizens believed to be cooperating with coalition forces or the Afghan government.

Insurgents also conducted a major campaign tied to the U.S. handover of the counterinsurgency campaign to NATO in 2006. Attacks occurred throughout the country before and after the han- dover, though most were in the south and east around the provinces of Helmand, Paktia, Paktika, and Kandahar.42 Some of the most brutal executions conducted by the insur- gents were of “collaborators” with the Afghan government or coali- tion forces.43 These targets included the assassination of Islamic clerics critical of the Taliban, such as Mullah Abdullah Fayyaz, head of the Ulema Council of Kandahar.44 As Figure 4.3 shows, primary targets included Afghan government oﬃcials, Afghan citizens, NGOs, edu- cational institutions, and religious ﬁgures. Schools were increasingly targeted in such provinces as Helmand. As one Taliban night letter warned: “Teachers’ salaries are ﬁnanced by non-believers.

In most insurgencies, the insurgent’s ability to achieve sanctu- ary in neighboring countries presents a major challenge for indigenous governments. Opportunities for such sanctuary are often exploited 46 Afghan Islamic Press, Interview with Mofti Latifollah Hakimi, August 30, 2005.

It is more diﬃcult for counterinsurgent forces to target insurgents who have retreated to these sanctuaries, which allow the insurgents to regroup, resupply, and recruit new members. Statistical evidence shows that mountainous terrain can provide a particularly useful sanctuary for insurgent groups because it is diﬃcult for indig- enous and external counterinsurgent forces to navigate and easier for insurgents to hide in.47 This presented a particular challenge in Afghan- istan, since the border areas and sanctuary in Pakistan included some of the world’s most rugged, mountainous terrain.48 Support from External States Insurgent groups were successful at leveraging assistance from exter- nal states—especially in Pakistan. There are indications that support from Pakistan included two major components: assistance from some oﬃcials in the Pakistan government and the freedom to operate on Pakistani soil. Oﬃcials in the Pakistan government had ideological and geostrate- gic motivations. As Pakistan’s former dictator General Zia-ul-Haq once remarked to the head of the ISI, General Akhter Abdul Rehman, “the water [in Afghanistan] must boil at the right temperature.”49 Afghani- stan has long been important to Pakistan policymakers because of its geographic location. Following the overthrow of the Taliban regime in 2001, oﬃcials in the Pakistan government were motivated to work with the Taliban for several reasons: to balance against India, especially in light of Delhi’s close rela- t tionship with the Afghan government 47 Fearon and Laitin, “Ethnicity, Insurgency, and Civil War;” Galula, Counterinsurgency Warfare, pp. 35–37. 48 On the impact of mountainous terrain on insurgencies, see Hosmer, The Army’s Role in Counterinsurgency and Insurgency, pp. 30–31; Daniel L.

The ISI provided assistance to the Taliban in the 1990s and early 2000s to ensure that it had an ally in Kabul. The motivation of those in the ISI assisting the Taliban in the mid-2000s was similar: to increase the likelihood over the long term that the government of Afghanistan (or at least those controlling the areas of Afghanistan near Pakistan) was controlled by allies. Balancing against India appeared to be a particularly strong impetus for Pakistan’s support of the insurgents. Pakistan and India have long been involved in a balance-of-power struggle in South Asia. Both lay claim to the Kashmir region and fought at least three wars over Kashmir since 1947. Since September 11, 2001, India provided several hundred million dollars in ﬁnancial assistance to Afghanistan, including funds to assist Afghan political candidates during the 2004 presidential elections and 2005 parliamentary elections. India also helped fund construction of the new Afghan parliament building and provided ﬁnancial assistance to elected legislators.50 India’s road con- struction near the Pakistan border was a signiﬁcant point of contention between India and Pakistan. These projects were run by India’s state- owned Border Roads Organisation, whose publicly acknowledged mis- sion was to help “the [Indian] armed forces meet their strategic needs by committed, dedicated and cost-eﬀective development and suste- nance of the infrastructure.”51 Finally, India established several consul- ates in such Afghan cities as Jalalabad, Kandahar, and Herat. Pakistan 50 David C.

Mulford is U.S. Ambassador to India. 51 Border Roads Organisation, Vision, Mission, Role (Delhi: Border Roads Organisation, 2006). 56 Counterinsurgency in Afghanistan accused India of using these consulates as a base for “terrorist activities” conducted inside Pakistan, such as fomenting unrest in the province of Baluchistan. The Indian-Afghan axis left Pakistan isolated among its South Asian neighbors. Before the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in the United States, Pakistan had a close relationship with the Taliban government in Afghanistan, which it had nurtured since the 1990s. Half a decade later, Pakistan was surrounded by hostile states. Conse- quently, for some Pakistani oﬃcials, assisting insurgents in Afghani- stan was a way to balance against Indian inﬂuence in Afghanistan, maximize Pakistan’s inﬂuence in the border regions, and prevent the Pashtuns on both sides of the border from developing a uniﬁed front and pushing for integration into Afghanistan. Some active and former Pakistan government oﬃcials from organizations such as the ISI and Frontier Corps provided logistical support to the Taliban and helped secure medical care for wounded insurgents in cities such as Quetta. They also helped train Taliban and other insurgents destined for Afghanistan and Kashmir in Quetta, Mansehra, Shamshattu, Parachinar, and other areas within Pakistan. To minimize its visibility, these individuals appeared to supply indirect assistance—including ﬁnancial assistance—to Taliban training camps. NATO oﬃcials uncovered several instances in which ISI operatives provided intelligence to Taliban insurgents at the tactical, operational, and strategic levels. This included tipping oﬀ Taliban forces about the location and movement of Afghan and coalition forces, which under- mined several U.S. and NATO anti-Taliban military operations.52 In addition, General Hamid Gul and Colonel Sultan Amir Imam, pro-Taliban and pro–al Qaeda Pakistani leaders, gave widely reported speeches at government and military institutions in Pakistan calling for jihad against the United States and the Afghan government.53 In 52 There is an extensive unclassiﬁed literature discussing support for insurgents by some individuals within the Pakistan government. See, for example, Carlotta Gall and David Rohde, “Militants Escape Control of Pakistan, Oﬃcials Say,” New York Times, January 15, 2007, p. A1; Rubin, “Saving Afghanistan;” Arnaud de Borchgrave, “Talibanization of Paki- stan,” Washington Times, April 7, 2007, p. A11; and Seth G.

Insurgents and Their Support Network 57 sum, individuals within the ISI and other Pakistan government agen- cies provided several types of assistance: ensuring that wounded Taliban and other insurgents received t medical aid training insurgents at camps in Pakistan t providing intelligence t providing ﬁnancial assistance t assisting with logistics in crossing the border. t This assistance is consistent with the Pakistan government’s past behavior, especially the ISI. Throughout the 1990s, Pakistan’s military and intelligence service provided arms, ammunition, supplies, ﬁnancial aid, and training to the Taliban and Gulbuddin Hekmatyar. Pakistan also helped recruit ﬁghters for the Taliban, sometimes working with domestic religious associations.54 In addition, insurgent groups had substantial freedom to operate in Pakistan. The Taliban and other insurgent groups shipped arms, ammunition, and supplies into Afghanistan from Pakistan. Many sui- cide bombers came from Afghan refugee camps located in Pakistan. IED components were often smuggled across the Afghanistan -Pakistan border and assembled at safe houses in and around such provinces as Kandahar. The Taliban used roads such as Highway 4 in Kandahar Province to transport ﬁghters and supplies between Afghanistan and Pakistan.55 Pakistan’s government failed several times to negotiate eﬀective peace deals with militants in such tribal regions as North and South Waziristan.56 These deals called on tribesmen to expel foreign militants and end cross-border attacks into Afghanistan. In return, Pakistan’s 54 Byman, Deadly Connections, pp. 194–198; Coll, Ghost Wars; Roy, Islam and Resistance in Afghanistan; Rashid, Taliban; Maley, Fundamentalism Reborn? 55 Author interviews with NATO oﬃcials in Afghanistan, January 2007. 56 See, for example, “Peace Pact: North Waziristan,” September 5, 2006. This agreement was negotiated by a “political agent from North Waziristan representing Governor N.W.F.P. Federal Government,” and “tribal representatives from North Waziristan, Local Mujahideen N.W.F.P, Atmanzai Tribe”; N.W.F.P. is Pakistan’s North West Frontier Province. 58 Counterinsurgency in Afghanistan military promised to end major operations in the area and pull most of its soldiers back to military camps. The logic of these deals seems intui- tive: In areas where tribes exert political, military, and economic power, the most eﬀective long-term solution was to create incentives for tribal leaders to police their areas. After all, these tribal areas had been ruled indigenously for hundreds of years. And tribes often regard outside forces, including Pakistan’s military, as unwelcome foreigners. But there were several problems with this strategy. First, it rested on a false assumption, since it presumed that tribes actually controlled these areas. A closer look at the tribal areas indicated that insurgents and terrorists like the Taliban increasingly exerted control. In many cases, they usurped the power of tribes. Expecting tribes to police areas they did not even control was wishful thinking. Second, the tribal deals failed to curb cross-border activity and undermine the power of the Taliban and other militant groups there. NATO oﬃcials I inter- viewed argued that insurgents crossed the border in greater numbers.57 As former Pakistan foreign minister Najmuddin Shaikh acknowledged in Pakistan’s Dawn newspaper, “There is no doubt that the Waziristan agreement has led to increased Taliban inﬂuence.”58 Third, there was no enforcement mechanism were the tribal deals to fail. Why should tribes cooperate, assuming they could, if there was no penalty for defection? Pakistan’s military expressed a deep unwillingness to enter the tribal areas again. Indeed, Afghan insurgents used Pakistan as a staging area for oﬀensive operations. Taliban insurgents that operated in the south- ern Afghan provinces of Kandahar, Oruzgan, Helmand, and Zabol had signiﬁcant support networks in such Pakistani provinces as Bal- uchistan and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, including in Waziristan. Due to common ethnicity, they received political support from some of Pakistan’s Pashtun tribes.59 The Taliban conduct much 57 Author interview with senior NATO oﬃcials, Afghanistan, 2006 and 2007. 58 Najmuddin A.

[Mullah Akhtar] Usmani, one of the Taliban leaders, spoke to Pakistan’s Geo TV at a time when the Pakistani intelligence services claimed that they did not know where [the Taliban leaders] were. If a TV company could ﬁnd him, how is it that the intelligence service of a country which has nuclear bombs and a lot of security and military forces cannot ﬁnd them?”62 In addition, Ali Jalali, former Afghan Interior Minister, argued, The Taliban have training camps, staging areas, recruiting cen- ters (madrassas), and safe havens in Pakistan. The operations of a 70,000-strong Pakistani military force, deployed in the border region, mostly in the Waziristan tribal areas, have been eﬀective against al Qaeda and non-Pakistani militants, but they have not done much toward containing the Taliban.63 D.C.: Center for Strategic and International Studies, May 14, 2004); Center for Army Les- sons Learned, Ranger Observations from OEF and OIF: Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (Fort Leavenworth, Kan.: Center for Army Lessons Learned, February 2005), p. 21; David L.

Iranian policymakers have long been interested in secur- ing strategic depth and inﬂuence in Afghanistan. Following the over- throw of the Taliban regime in 2001, the Iranian government funded reconstruction projects in Afghanistan (including road construction projects) and provided aid to some warlords. This behavior was consis- tent with the activities of such regional powers as Pakistan, India, and Russia. Indeed, the Iranian strategy in Afghanistan after the overthrow of the Taliban is perhaps best characterized as a “hedging strategy.”68 64 “Pakistan Strikes Suspected al Qaeda Camp,” Associated Press, March 1, 2006. 65 There have been some notable exceptions, such as the Pakistani government’s capture of Taliban spokesman Abdol Latifollah Hakimi in October 2005. The Pakistani govern- ment has also closed a few businesses owned by Taliban-linked traders. In January 2006, for example, the Pakistani government closed Haji Abdul Bari’s Special Company in Peshawar and the Maria Food Company in Islamabad, and froze $5 million in their accounts, because the owners helped ﬁnance Taliban ﬁghters. 66 Intikhab Amir, “Waziristan: No Man’s Land,” The Herald (Pakistan), April 2006, p. 78. 67 Shahzada Zulﬁqar, “Endless War,” The Herald (Pakistan), April 2006, pp. 33–36; Fred- eric Grare, Pakistan: The Resurgence of Baluch Nationalism (Washington, D.C.: Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, January 2006). 68 On hedging, see Robert J.

Ross, eds., Engaging China: The Management of Emerging Power (New York: Rout- ledge, 1999), pp. 1–32. Insurgents and Their Support Network 61 The Iranian government preferred a close relationship with the Afghan government, which it enjoyed with key Afghan policymakers. Iran and Afghanistan cooperated in trying to crack down on drugs passing over their shared border. They also participated in joint trade, energy, investment, cultural, and scientiﬁc projects.69 However, Iran also saw its involvement in Afghanistan as a hedge against a possible U.S. or Israeli strike against Iranian nuclear facili- ties. This meant that Iran was prepared to undermine U.S. eﬀorts in Afghanistan in the event of further deterioration of U.S.-Iranian relations. There was some evidence that individuals from the Iranian government, including from the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps– Quds Force, provided some arms, money, and training to Taliban com- manders and other insurgents. Examples included explosively formed penetrators, anti-tank mines, mortars, and small arms.70 However, there were limits to Iran’s willingness to support the Taliban and other insurgent groups. Iran historically had poor relations with the Taliban. As one Iranian diplomat noted in 1997, for exam- ple, Iran joined “Russia and the anti-Taliban alliance against Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the Taliban” because it was concerned about the rise of Sunni extremist groups like the Taliban.71 Jihadist Support Another source of support for the insurgency in Afghanistan was the international jihadist network, which enabled the Taliban and other groups to sustain their operations and helped them become more lethal in attacks against Afghans and coalition forces. This support came from a variety of diﬀerent jihadist sources. One source was organiza- 69 Author interview with Afghan Foreign Minister Rangin Dadfar Spanta, Washington, D.C., July 2006; author interview with Zalmai Rassoul, Afghanistan National Security Advisor, Kabul, Afghanistan, November 2005. 70 On Iranian involvement in Afghanistan, see McConnell, 2008; John Ward Anderson, “Arms Seized in Afghanistan Sent from Iran, NATO Says,” Washington Post, September 21, 2007, p.

Afghan insurgent groups also received assistance from the collection of zakat (the Islamic concept of tithing and alms) at mosques in Pakistan, Afghanistan, and the broader Muslim world. Finally, much of the jihadist funding came from wealthy Muslims abroad, especially from such Gulf states as the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar. For example, al Qaeda personnel regularly met with wealthy Arab businessmen during the Tabligh Jamaat annual meeting in Raiwind, Pakistan, which attracted one of the largest concentrations of Muslims after the hajj.72 The Taliban and other insurgent groups established a major sup- port base through their cooperation with Jamiat-e-Ulema Islam. This Pakistani political party had its roots in the Deobandi movement and had a following largely conﬁned to the Pashtun border belt of the North West Frontier Province and Baluchistan (although it also has support in several of Pakistan’s urban centers). The Deobandi move- ment developed in British-ruled India during the mid-1800s. It was an oﬀshoot of the Sunni Hanaﬁ legal school and took its name from the Indian Himalayan town of Deoband, the location of an inﬂuential religious school. The Deobandi movement aimed to reform and unify Muslims, preached strict adherence to the Sunnah (the way or deeds of the Prophet Muhammad), and emphasized the importance of shari’a law. Jamiat-e-Ulema Islam was split into two factions, led by Maulana Fazal ur-Rehman and Samiul Haq (a fervent supporter of Osama bin Laden). The party ran an extensive network of madrassas that trained most of the leadership and much of the early rank and ﬁle of the Tali- ban. Party links with the Taliban remained close, despite President Musharraf’s talk of reforming the madrassas. Indeed, Afghan insur- gents long targeted recruits at madrassas and Afghan refugee camps in Pakistan. Al Qaeda played a critical role in the insurgency as a force mul- tiplier, assisting insurgent groups such as the Taliban at the tactical, operational, and strategic levels. Groups such as the Taliban used sup- 72 Alex Alexiev, “Tablighi Jamaat: Jihad’s Stealthy Legions,” Middle East Quarterly, Vol. XII, No. 1 (Winter 2005).

Insurgents and Their Support Network 63 port and training from jihadists to construct increasingly sophisticated IEDs, including IEDs with remote-control detonators. For example, there were a handful of al Qaeda–run training facilities and IED assembly facilities in such places as North and South Waziristan. They ranged from small facilities hidden in compounds to much larger “IED factories,” which doubled as training centers and labs where recruits experimented with IED technology. These facilities were located in such remote places as the Bush mountains, Khamran mountains, and Shakai valley. Al Qaeda received operational and ﬁnancial support from local clerics and Taliban commanders in Waziristan. They recruited young Pashtuns from the local madrassas and ﬁnanced their activities through “religious racket”—forced religious contribution, often accompanied with death threats. Some of this IED expertise came from Iraqi groups, which provided information to Afghan groups on making and using various kinds of remote-controlled devices and timers. Indeed, there is evidence of cooperation between insurgents in Iraq and Afghanistan. Islamic militants in Iraq provided information through the Internet and face-to-face visits on tactics to Taliban, Hezb-i-Islami, and for- eign ﬁghters from eastern and southern Afghanistan and Pakistan’s tribal areas. In addition, there is some evidence that a small number of Pakistani and Afghan militants received military training in Iraq; Iraqi ﬁghters met with Afghan and Pakistani extremists in Pakistan; and militants in Afghanistan increasingly used homemade bombs, suicide attacks, and other tactics honed in Iraq.73 The “TV bomb” is one example of an IED introduced to Afghan insurgents by Iraqi groups. This shaped-charge mechanism can be hidden under brush or debris on a roadside and set oﬀ by remote control from a distance of 300 yards or more. There is also some evi- dence that individuals such as Hamza Sangari, a Taliban commander from Khowst Province, received information from Iraqi groups that improved the Taliban’s ability to make armor-penetrating weapons by disassembling rockets and rocket-propelled grenade rounds, remov- 73 Interview with Mullah Dadullah, Al Jazeera TV, July 2005.

In December 2005, for example, insurgents posted a video to al Qaeda– linked Web sites showing the decapitation of an Afghan hostage—the ﬁrst time a video of the beheading of an Afghan hostage was shown.75 The Taliban also acquired new commercial communication gear and ﬁeld equipment from Iraqi groups and received good tactical, camou- ﬂage, and marksmanship training from them as well. In addition, Afghan insurgents increasingly adopted suicide tac- tics, especially in major cities such as Kandahar and Kabul.76 The number of suicide attacks increased steadily: one in 2002, two in 2003, six in 2004, and twenty-seven in 2005. There were 139 suicide terror- ist attacks in Afghanistan in 2006 and 140 in 2007.77 The use of sui- cide attacks was encouraged by al Qaeda leaders in Pakistan, such as Ayman al-Zawahiri, who argued for the “need to concentrate on the method of martyrdom operations as the most successful way of inﬂict- ing damage against the opponent and the least costly to the Mujahedin in terms of casualties.”78 Suicide bombers included Afghans, Pakistanis, and some foreigners.79 Most suicide bombers through 2007 came from Afghan refugee camps in Pakistan. They frequently attended Pakistani 74 Author interview with Afghan government oﬃcials, Kabul, Afghanistan, August 2006. 75 In what appeared to be a forced confession, Saeed Allah Khan stated, “I worked as a spy for the Americans along with four other people. The group received $45,000 and my share is $7,000” (Hekmat Karzai, Afghanistan and the Globalisation of Terrorist Tactics, Singapore: Institute of Defence and Strategic Studies, January 2006). 76 On the rationale for suicide bombers, see Interview with Mullah Dadullah, Al Jazeera TV, February 2006. 77 The data on suicide attacks came from the RAND-MIPT Terrorism Incident Data- base, the U.S. Department of Defense, the Centre for Conﬂict and Peace Studies in Kabul, and Jason Straziuso, “U.S. Casualties in Afghanistan Hit Record,” Navy Times, January 2, 2008. 78 Ayman al-Zawahiri, Knights Under the Prophets Banner (n.p., December 2001). 79 In its public rhetoric, the Taliban has tended to identify the suicide bombers as Afghans, since it suggests that there is a signiﬁcant indigenous component of the insurgency. Insurgents and Their Support Network 65 madrassas, where they were radicalized and immersed in extremist ideologies.80 Several factors can be attributed to the rise in suicide attacks.81 First, the Taliban successfully tapped into the expertise and training of the broader jihadist community, especially al Qaeda. Jihadists imparted knowledge on suicide tactics to Afghan groups through the Internet and in face-to-face visits. With al Qaeda’s assistance, these militants helped supply a steady stream of suicide bombers. Second, al Qaeda and the Taliban concluded that suicide bombing was more eﬀective than other tactics in killing Afghan and coalition forces. This was a direct result of the success of such groups as Hamas in the Palestinian territories, Hez- bollah in Lebanon, the Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka, and Iraqi groups.82 Suicide attacks allowed insurgents to achieve maximum impact with minimal resources. Data show that when insurgents ﬁght U.S. and coalition forces directly in Afghanistan, there is only a 5 percent proba- bility of inﬂicting casualties. With suicide attacks, the chance of killing people and instilling fear increased several fold.83 Third, al Qaeda and the Taliban believed that suicide attacks increased the level of insecu- rity among the Afghan population. This caused some Afghans to ques- tion the government’s ability to protect them and further destabilized 80 Author interviews with NATO oﬃcials in Kandahar, Afghanistan, January and Septem- ber 2007; United Nations Assistance Mission to Afghanistan, Suicide Attacks in Afghanistan: 2001–2007 (Kabul: United Nations Assistance Mission to Afghanistan, 2007). 81 Hekmat Karzai, Afghanistan and the Logic of Suicide Terrorism (Singapore: Institute of Defence and Strategic Studies, March 2006); “Taliban Claim Responsibility for Suicide Bomb Attack in Afghan Kandahar Province,” Peshawar Afghan Islamic Press, October 9, 2005; “Pajhwok News Describes Video of Afghan Beheading by ‘Masked Arabs,’ Taliban,” Pajhwok Afghan News, October 9, 2005; “Canadian Soldier Dies in Suicide Attack in Kan- dahar,” Afghan Islamic Press, March 3, 2006; “Taliban Claim Attack on Police in Jalalabad, Nangarhar Province,” Kabul National TV, January 7, 2006. 82 See, for example, Robert Pape, Dying to Win: The Strategic Logic of Suicide Terrorism (New York: Random House, 2005); Mia Bloom, Dying to Kill: The Allure of Suicide Terror (New York: Columbia University Press, 2005); Christoph Reuter, My Life Is a Weapon: A Modern History of Suicide Bombing (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 2004); Hoﬀman, Inside Terrorism. 83 Hekmat Karzai and Seth G.

Fourth, suicide attacks provided renewed visibility for the Taliban and al Qaeda, which pre- vious guerrilla attacks did not generate. Because of their lethality and high-proﬁle nature, every suicide attack was reported in the national and international media. In sum, the international jihadist network provided signiﬁcant support to Afghan insurgent groups. Al Qaeda eﬀectively spread its extremist global ideology in Afghanistan and Pakistan. It played a crit- ical role in providing encouragement and impetus for the utilization of suicide attacks and sophisticated IEDs. Al Qaeda also paid up to sev- eral thousand dollars to the families of suicide bombers who perished in operations in Afghanistan. In addition, some Taliban units included al Qaeda members or other Arab ﬁghters, who brought with them tac- tics employed in such places as Iraq and Chechnya.84 Conclusion External support from state and nonstate actors was critical to the return of the Taliban and the rise of the insurgency in Afghanistan beginning in 2002. Support came from individuals in the Pakistan government and the international jihadist movement, including al Qaeda. Insurgent groups with signiﬁcant external support and well- established sanctuaries in neighboring states have frequently been suc- cessful. This is a recurring lesson across insurgencies since at least 1945. Chapter Seven will explore in more depth U.S. capabilities that might be useful to counter external support networks. 84 Author interview with U.S. government oﬃcials, Kabul, Afghanistan, December 2005. 67 CHAPTER FIVE Afghan Government and Security Forces This chapter examines lessons from the conduct of the Afghan govern- ment and security forces. It argues that two critical variables related to the indigenous government impact the success or failure of coun- terinsurgency operations: the quality of indigenous forces and gov- ernance capacity. Key Afghan forces include the ANP, ANA, and a range of allied militia forces such as the Afghan National Auxiliary Police. Building on the argument made in the previous chapter (that insurgents were increasingly able to conduct violence in the south and east of Afghanistan due in large part to external support and sanctu- ary), this chapter contends that Afghan forces were a mixed bag as far as their ability to establish security. The ANA was relatively compe- tent in combat operations, while the police were largely incompetent and corrupt. This chapter also contends that the weakness of Afghani- stan’s central government was problematic. Corruption within the government was detrimental to the counterinsurgency campaign and decreased popular support for the Afghan government. Lessons from the Afghan government and its security forces can be grouped into two broad categories: the capability of indigenous forces (including Afghanistan’s intelligence agency) and the governance capacity of national, provincial, and district government institutions. Capability of Indigenous Forces The competence of Afghanistan’s indigenous security forces is diﬃ- cult to judge for two reasons. First, many of the most useful metrics 68 Counterinsurgency in Afghanistan are qualitative rather than quantitative and diﬃcult to measure accu- rately. Examples include the performance of security forces in conduct- ing cordon-and-search operations, patrols, border security, riot control, intelligence collection, and combat operations.1 Second, little data have been systematically collected for several decades in Afghanistan. For example, there are no reliable statistics on homicide rates, which may provide some indication of the competence of police forces. We there- fore must resort to largely qualitative judgments. Afghan National Police The evidence suggests that ANP was the least competent of the Afghanistan government forces. The ﬁrst team of German police trainers arrived in Kabul in March 2002 to train police instructors. This training was critical, since Afghan police had not received any formal training for at least two decades.2 The Germans focused on training inspectors and lieutenants at the police academy in Kabul. Oﬃcers went through a three-year training course and took classes on human rights, tactical operations, narcotics investigations, traﬃc, criminal investigations, computer skills, and Islamic law.3 By 2003, however, U.S. oﬃcials from the Department of State, Department of Defense, and the White House became increasingly unhappy with the German approach. Many argued that it was far too slow, trained too few police oﬃcers, and was seriously underfunded.4 Consequently, the 1 See, for example, Combined Forces Command—Afghanistan, Afghan National Security Forces Operational Primacy Process (Kabul, Afghanistan: Combined Forces Command— Afghanistan, 2006). 2 Government of Germany, Federal Foreign Oﬃce and Federal Ministry of Interior, Assis- tance in Rebuilding the Police Force in Afghanistan, p. 6; Asian Development Bank and World Bank, Afghanistan: Preliminary Needs Assessment for Recovery and Reconstruction (Kabul: Asian Development Bank and World Bank, January 2002), p. 7. 3 Author interview with Jochen Rieso, Training Branch, German Project for Support of the Police in Afghanistan, Kabul, Afghanistan, June 27, 2004. 4 As one high-level U.S. oﬃcial noted, “When it became clear that they were not going to provide training to lower-level police oﬃcers, and were moving too slowly with too few resources, we decided to intervene to prevent the program from failing” (author interview with senior U.S. oﬃcial, White House, September 2004). This view was corroborated by Afghan Government and Security Forces 69 United States concentrated on training lower-level recruits at a cen- tral training center in Kabul, as well as at regional training centers in outlying cities, such as Kandahar, Mazar-e Sharif, Gardez, and Jalala- bad. The Department of State’s Bureau of International Narcotics and Law En forcement contracted DynCorp to train the police and to help build training facilities.5 Beginning in 2005, the U.S. military took over the lead U.S. police training role after rising concerns in the U.S. Department of Defense about the eﬀectiveness of the police program. Key problems included the failures to conduct follow-on mentoring of Afghan police, to provide signiﬁcant institutional reform in the Min- istry of Interior, and to curb deep-seated corruption in the police and Ministry of Interior.6 The U.S. military provided training, equipment, and other assistance to ANP and internal security forces through the Combined Security Transition Command–Afghanistan. The available evidence suggests that the ANP was corrupt and often unable to perform basic patrolling, conduct counterinsurgency operations, protect reconstruction projects, prevent border incursions, or conduct counternarcotics operations. Multiple interviews with U.S. and other NATO oﬃcials involved in police training from 2004 through 2008 indicate that corruption was pervasive in the ANP. Police regu- larly took bribes to allow drugs and other licit and illicit goods to pass along routes they controlled. Police chiefs were frequently involved in “skimming” money they received to pay their police oﬃcers.7 Indeed, corruption appeared to be more pervasive in the police than in other security forces.8 multiple interviews by the author with U.S. oﬃcials in Washington and Afghanistan in 2004 and 2005. 5 Author interview with employees of DynCorp, Kabul and Gardez, June 2004 and November 2005. 6 Author interview with members of the Oﬃce of Security Cooperation–Afghanistan, Kabul, December 2005. 7 Author interviews with U.S. and German police oﬃcials, Afghanistan, 2004, 2005, 2006, and 2007. 8 Afghanistan Ministry of Interior, Afghan National Police Program (Kabul: Ministry of Interior, 2005); Barnett Rubin, Afghanistan’s Uncertain Transition from Turmoil to Normalcy (New York: Council on Foreign Relations, 2006); U.S. Government Accountability Oﬃce, 70 Counterinsurgency in Afghanistan ANP competence was also low. As a 2006 German assessment of the border police concluded, “Neither the Afghan border police nor the customs authorities are currently in a position to meet the challenges presented by this long border.”9 A report by the Oﬃces of Inspector General of the U.S. Departments of State and Defense concluded that the “ANP’s readiness level to carry out its internal security and con- ventional police responsibilities is far from adequate. The obstacles to establish a fully professional ANP are formidable.” It found that key obstacles included “no eﬀective ﬁeld training oﬃcer (FTO) program, illiterate recruits, a history of low pay and pervasive corruption, and an insecure environment.”10 ANP forces had a diﬃcult time even against criminal organiza- tions. In February 2006, for example, ANP forces were attacked, cap- tured, and disarmed by a drug cartel in Balkh Province after an armed clash.11 As Ali Jalali, former Afghan Minister of Interior, argued, “[B] ecause of the late start in comprehensive police development, the ANP continues to be ill-trained, poorly paid, under-equipped, and inad- equately armed.”12 The ANP was vital to establishing order in urban and rural areas. But it was badly equipped, corrupt, poorly trained, and lacked any semblance of a national police infrastructure. There was little oversight at the provincial or district levels. The Afghan police lacked uniforms, armored vehicles, weapons, ammunition, police sta- tions, police jails, national command and control, and investigative Afghanistan Security: Eﬀorts to Establish Army and Police Have Made Progress, but Future Plans Need to Be Better Deﬁned (Washington, D.C.: GAO, 2005). 9 Government of Germany, Doha II Conference on Border Management in Afghanistan: A Regional Approach (Berlin: Government of Germany, 2006).

Several factors contributed to the poor competence of the ANP. International training was not as good as it was for the ANA. The police were not an international priority in the early stages of the insurgency and received signiﬁcantly less money and attention than the ANA. Interviews with U.S. and German oﬃcials involved in police train- ing suggest that there were signiﬁcant challenges with DynCorp, the U.S.-based company hired by the U.S. Department of State to imple- ment police training at regional training centers across Afghanistan. One recurring criticism was wide variation in the quality of DynCorp police trainers. Some had signiﬁcant international police training expe- rience and were competent in dealing with police in a tribal society in the middle of an insurgency. But many other DynCorp trainers had little experience or competence.14 The use of private contractors for police training or other tasks during counterinsurgency and nation- building operations has long been controversial.15 At the very least, the U.S. government should conduct a thorough assessment of the perfor- mance and eﬀectiveness of contractors in police training. In addition, the lack of follow-on mentoring meant that police were given a few weeks of training and sent back to their villages with no oversight and assistance. Most had never received formal police training. ANA soldiers beneﬁted from embedded international train- ers when they deployed into the ﬁeld, and the ANA almost always deployed with U.S. and other coalition military forces. But the ANP lacked a comprehensive mentoring program. U.S. oﬃcials argued even in 2008 that security concerns in the south and east precluded the deployment of mentoring teams to rural areas. This meant that in areas where a competent ANP was essential because of the growing presence 13 McCaﬀrey, “Trip to Afghanistan and Pakistan.” 14 Author interviews with U.S. and German police oﬃcials, Afghanistan, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2008. 15 On the role of civilian contractors for security sector reform, see, for example, P. W. Singer, Corporate Warriors: The Rise of the Privatized Military Industry (Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 2003). 72 Counterinsurgency in Afghanistan of the Taliban, there was virtually no mentoring. The lack of mentor- ing made police more susceptible to local warlords. Indeed, ANP forces were frequently more loyal to local warlords, tribal leaders, and even criminal networks than to the central government. This reﬂects the weakness of the central government and the strength of nonstate actors in much of the country. In counterinsurgency operations, the police need to be involved in the community at all levels, such as monitoring border posts and patrolling cities, villages, and highways. Building the police in counter- insurgencies should be a higher priority than the creation of the army because the police are the primary arm of the government in towns and villages across the country. Unfortunately, this was not the case in Afghanistan. The ANP needed to be at the forefront of ﬁghting insurgents, illegal border incursions, illicit drug trade, warlords, and organized crime in Afghanistan, but they were overwhelmed. Unfor- tunately, the situation in Afghanistan is not unique—building a com- petent and legitimate police force has been a major challenge in numer- ous counterinsurgency and stability operations.16 Afghan National Army The available data suggest that the competence of ANA forces has improved since 2002, when training began. The United States was the lead nation for building the ANA, although French, British, Turkish, and other instructors from coalition countries were also involved.17 16 On policing during counterinsurgency and stability operations, see Robert B.

Singer, “A New Model Afghan Army,” Foreign Aﬀairs, Vol. Afghan Government and Security Forces 73 Training commenced in May 2002, when the ANA’s ﬁrst regular army battalion began 10 weeks of infantry and combat training at the Kabul Military Training Center. U.S. special operations forces assigned to the U.S. Army’s 1st Battalion, 3rd Special Forces Group provided the ini- tial training.18 Combined Security Transition Command– Afghanistan, including Task Force Phoenix, then took over the bulk of ANA train- ing. New Afghan recruits received training on basic riﬂe marksman- ship; platoon and company-level tactics; use of heavy weapons; and engineering, scout, and medical skills. Desertion rates were initially high; Afghanistan’s 1st Battalion had a desertion rate of approximately 50 percent. But the rate eventually dropped to 10 percent per month by the summer of 2003, between 2 percent and 3 percent per month by 2004, and 1.25 percent per month by 2006.19 Several units of the ANA were deployed throughout Afghani- stan to conduct combat operations against Taliban and other insur- gent forces and to oversee the cantonment of heavy weapons. In July 2003, for example, the ANA launched Operation Warrior Sweep with U.S. forces in the Paktia Province against Taliban and al Qaeda forces. This was followed in November 2003 by Operation Mountain Resolve in the Nuristan and Kunar provinces. The ANA deployed outside of Kabul to stem interfactional ﬁghting in such areas as Herat and Maimana.

For example, some Afghan soldiers believed they would be taken to the United States for training.

In 2004, the ANA conducted combat operations, such as Operation Princess and Operation Ticonderoga, in a number of prov- inces in the east and south including Kandahar, Kunar, Uruzgan, Hel- mand, and Paktia. In other provinces, such as Herat, the government deployed ANA and police forces to patrol roads, secure government and UN buildings, and institute a curfew following the removal of Ismail Khan. In 2005, ANA forces participated in such campaigns as Operation Catania in Kunar Province, which targeted insurgent hide- outs prior to the September parliamentary elections.20 In 2006, ANA soldiers played a key role in a number of oﬀensive campaigns to kill or capture insurgents, including Operation Moun- tain Thrust in southern Afghanistan and Operation Mountain Lion in Kunar Province.21 Soldiers from the 3rd Brigade of the ANA’s 203rd Corps fought alongside service members from the Combined Forces Command–Afghanistan’s Task Force Spartan, made up of soldiers from the U.S. Army’s 3rd Brigade Combat Team of the 10th Moun- tain Division and 1st Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment U.S. Marines from Task Force Lava. More than 2,500 ANA and coalition forces were involved in the operation.22 Evidence from ANA actions during these operations suggests three conclusions about their competence. First, ANA soldiers were usually tenacious ﬁghters in battle and became more proﬁcient in tac- tics, techniques, and procedures for ﬁghting counterinsurgency war- fare following U.S. and coalition training. This included combat pro- ﬁciency, crowd control, and humanitarian assistance and civil-action 20 “Fighting in Afghanistan Leaves 40 Insurgents Dead,” American Forces Press Service, June 22, 2005. 21 “Coalition Launches ‘Operation Mountain Lion’ in Afghanistan,” American Forces Press Service, April 12, 2006. 22 U.S. Air Force F-15Es, A-10s and B-52s provided close air support to troops on the ground engaged in rooting out insurgent sanctuaries and support networks. Royal Air Force GR-7s also provided close air support to coalition troops in contact with enemy forces. U.S. Air Force Global Hawk and Predator aircraft provided intelligence, surveillance, and reconnais- sance, while KC-135 and KC-10 aircraft provided refueling support. Afghan Government and Security Forces 75 projects.23 Second, they were eﬀective in gathering intelligence about insurgents, their support network, and weapon caches. Third, training from U.S. and coalition forces was a critical factor in improving the ANA’s competence.24 Despite their increasing competence, however, ANA forces still suﬀered from a lack of indigenous air support and the absence of a self-sustaining operational budget. They also relied on embedded inter- national forces and U.S. air support during combat. The ANA was under-resourced, which was a major morale factor for soldiers. They had shoddy small arms, and there were numerous reports of soldiers using weapons seized from the Taliban, who some believe were better armed. Many soldiers had little ammunition and few magazines. Numerous ANA units did not have mortars and had few machine guns, few MK-19 grenade machine guns, and no artillery. They had almost no helicopter or ﬁxed-wing transport, as well as no attack avia- tion. They had no body armor or blast glasses, Kevlar®25 helmets, up- armored Humvee’s, or light armor tracked vehicles with machine gun cupolas and slat armor.26 This impacted their ability to conduct sus- tained operations against well-equipped Taliban forces. Other Afghan Security Forces There is some evidence that Afghan security forces outside of the ANP and ANA were eﬀective in conducting counterinsurgency operations. These forces included the Afghan National Auxiliary Police and mili- tias trained by U.S. special forces, the CIA, and other coalition gov- ernments. But these successes were partly outweighed by growing evi- 23 Major Robert W. Redding, “19th SF Group Utilizes MCA Missions to Train Afghan National Army Battalions,” Special Warfare, Vol. 17, February 2005, pp. 22–27. 24 Some have argued that the emphasis on quality has a high price tag. For example, a World Bank study concluded, “The ANA salary structure, determined apparently without reference to ﬁscal constraints or pay elsewhere in the civil service, has set a precedent which the police and other sectors aspire to and which will be ﬁscally costly.” World Bank, Afghanistan: Man- aging Public Finances for Development (Washington, D.C.: World Bank, 2005), p. 24. 25 Kevlar® is a registered trademark of the DuPont Corporation. 26 McCaﬀrey, “Trip to Afghanistan and Pakistan.” 76 Counterinsurgency in Afghanistan dence that these local militia forces weakened the power of the central government. The Afghan National Auxiliary Police was established in 2006 because of the low quality of the ANP, the inadequate number of ANA soldiers in the south, and the growing level of insurgent violence in the south and east. These developments led to calls within the Afghan government and NATO for a paramilitary police force equipped and trained to ﬁght the Taliban. Some also supported the creation of an auxiliary police force as a way to lure young ﬁghters from local vil- lages away from the Taliban. The auxiliary police force was designed to secure static checkpoints, provide community policing, and deploy with NATO military forces during operations. Recruits were chosen by local tribal elders, and many worked for local warlords. Field reports from the south indicated that they were competent in battle.27 How- ever, there were several concerns with the auxiliary force. One was that they were a legalized militia more loyal to local warlords than to the central government. Second was suspicion that Taliban members inﬁl- trated the auxiliary police force. The Afghan government and NATO targeted ﬁghters that could—or perhaps already had—fought for the Taliban but were not ideologically committed to Deobandism or jihad against the West. This strategy risked opening the door to Taliban sym- pathizers. Third was the minimal training that recruits received. Aux- iliary police recruits went through a two-week training course, which included lessons on the Afghan constitution, human rights, the use of weapons, and basic police tactics. At the end of the course, the recruits were given an AK-47 gun and sent to their home districts. This train- ing was not suﬃcient. Besides the auxiliary police, the U.S. and other coalition forces worked with or established a number of local militias. These militias performed a wide range of missions, including providing base camp security, participating in direct action operations, helping to hunt high- value targets, conducting counternarcotics operations, and providing border security. In Paktika Province, for example, a single squad-size team of U.S. soldiers recruited a company-sized element of Afghans 27 Author interview with NATO and Afghan oﬃcials, Afghanistan, January 2007. Afghan Government and Security Forces 77 to conduct combat operations and stabilization missions; they also recruited another similarly sized unit that provided force protection at remote ﬁre bases from which the U.S. soldiers operated.28 These units occupied the same areas of operation as the ANA and had a similar mission. But they faced fewer organizational problems, and desertion was practically nonexistent. Soldiers were paid well and regularly, a striking contrast from ANA and ANP forces. Incompetent leaders and undisciplined soldiers were often quickly and severely punished. The best soldiers could expect to move up to positions of increasing respon- sibility and pay based on fair criteria. As one U.S. military assessment concluded, Afghan militia forces “led every mounted patrol and most major operations,” partly because “they knew the ground better and could more easily spot something that was out of place or suspicious.”29 Such forces were often used for the outer perimeter of cordon-and- search operations. They surrounded villages and stopped insurgents from escaping. In several operations, such as the Battle of Deh Chopan in August 2003, they were critical in providing intelligence and the bulk of the maneuver force.30 As discussed below, however, the U.S. government’s use of militia forces also weakened the central govern- ment and strengthened local warlords. National Directorate for Security There is little unclassiﬁed data on the activities and performance of Afghanistan’s intelligence agency, the National Directorate for Secu- rity (NDS). But its role is critical in counterinsurgency operations. As David Galula wrote in his book Counterinsurgency Warfare, gathering intelligence in a counterinsurgency campaign poses a dilemma: 28 Fire bases are military encampments designed to provide support to infantry operating in areas beyond the normal range of major base camps. 29 Buﬀaloe, Conventional Forces in Low-Intensity Conﬂict, p. 12. 30 For a ﬁrst-hand account of the Battle for Deh Chopan, see Michael McInerney, “The Battle for Deh Chopan, Part 1,” Soldier of Fortune, August 2004; Michael McInerney, “The Battle for Deh Chopan, Part 2,” Soldier of Fortune, September 2004. 78 Counterinsurgency in Afghanistan Intelligence is the principal source of information on guerrillas, and intelligence has to come from the population, but the popu- lation will not talk unless it feels safe, and it does not feel safe until the insurgent’s power has been broken.31 In Afghanistan, this posed a challenge for NDS activities in rural areas in which the Taliban enjoyed a support base. In spite of these challenges, NDS agents became increasingly involved in intelligence collection and psychological operations in rural areas of the south and east, including the use of informant networks. One key target was mosques. Since the Taliban was successful in co-opting some mullahs, the NDS focused on inﬂuencing “nationalist” mullahs supportive of the Afghan government or, at a minimum, opposed to the Taliban. As NDS director Amrullah Saleh argued, “We should put our weight behind the nationalist ones and not allow the militant or fanatic ones to take over. This is only possible if we keep the nationalist ones on our pay-rolls.”32 The NDS also enjoyed some counterinsurgency success in urban cities, such as Kabul. In late 2006, for example, NDS agents inﬁltrated and took down several suicide terrorism cells in Kabul with assistance from Western intelligence agencies.33 Governance Good governance is critical to eﬀective counterinsurgency operations over the long run, because it helps to ensure sustained popular support for the government. As an NDS report concluded, “The ﬁrst require- ment of countering Taliban at the village level requires good gover- nance, honest and competent leaders leading the institutions.”34 Three factors have undermined good governance in Afghanistan: the power 31 Galula, Counterinsurgency Warfare, p. 72. 32 Saleh, Strategy of Insurgents and Terrorists in Afghanistan, p. 10. 33 Interview with Western government oﬃcials, Afghanistan, January 2007. 34 Saleh, Strategy of Insurgents and Terrorists in Afghanistan, p. 10. Afghan Government and Security Forces 79 of warlords and tribal militias; the drug trade, which has contributed to pervasive corruption; and an ineﬀective justice system. Warlords and Tribal Militias The 2004 presidential elections and 2005 parliamentary elections established a democratically elected central government in Afghani- stan. However, they did not create a strong central government. Indeed, the weakness of Afghanistan’s central government and the role of regional warlords and tribal militias posed a signiﬁcant challenge to the counter insurgency campaign. As the Afghanistan National Secu- rity Council’s National Threat Assessment concluded, Non-statutory armed forces and their commanders pose a direct threat to the national security of Afghanistan. They are the prin- cipal obstacle to the expansion of the rule of law into the prov- inces and thus the achievement of the social economic goals that the people of Afghanistan their Government, supported by the International Community, to deliver.35 Afghanistan has historically lacked a strong central government. But the reliance of U.S.-led coalition forces on warlords contributed to the empowerment of factional commanders and the weakness of the central government.36 This began in 2001, when the U.S. military and CIA cooperated with Northern Alliance and other military forces to overthrow the Taliban regime. And it continued over the course of the insurgency. But the assistance supplied to warlords in the south and east by U.S. and coalition forces as part of Operation Enduring Free- dom was a double-edged sword. While some cooperation may have been useful and necessary to combat insurgents—especially in the early stages of Operation Enduring Freedom—it also weakened the central government by increasing the power of warlords. The central government made an attempt to reduce the power of warlord-governors 35 Afghanistan National Security Council, National Threat Assessment (Kabul: Afghani- stan National Security Council, 2005), p. 3.

Perhaps its most signiﬁcant impact was the growth of corruption that paralleled its rise. Afghanistan has a relatively short history as a major opium producer dating back to the 1980s. Criminal organizations, the Tal- iban, and warlords have historically used drug money to help fund their military campaigns and earn a proﬁt. In 1997, the UN and the United States estimated that 96 percent of Afghan heroin came from areas under Taliban control. The Taliban expanded the area available for opium poppy production, as well as increased trade and transport routes through such neighboring countries as Pakistan.39 In July 2000, Mullah Omar banned the cultivation—though not the traﬃcking—of opium poppy, which the Taliban eﬀectively enforced. The ban caused a temporary decrease in the cultivation and production of opium poppy in 2001. But the damage had been done, as Afghanistan had already become a major producer of opium poppy. It was the world’s largest producer of poppy during the Taliban rule, when the country was the source of 70 percent of global illicit poppy. The cultivation, production, and trade in opium poppy increased over the course of the counterinsurgency campaign. Acreage cultiva- tion ﬁgures are diﬃcult to estimate, but UN data suggest that the 37 Several warlords were reassigned as provincial governors, such as: Sher Mohammad Akondzada of Helmand (2005), Ismail Khan of Herat (2004), Gul Agha of Kandahar (2004), Haji Din Mohammad of Nangarhar, Mohammad Ibrahim of Ghor (2004), Gul Ahmad of Badghis (2003), and Syed Amin of Badakshan (2003). 38 MAJ Andrew M.

It dipped slightly to 104,000 in 2005, and then rose again to 165,000 hectares in 2006 and 193,000 hectares in 2007. Afghanistan’s share of opium poppy production stood at 93 percent of the world total in 2007.41 Figure 5.1 Opium Poppy Cultivation, 1986–2007 180,000 160,000 140,000 120,000 100,000 80,000 60,000 40,000 20,000 0 200,000 190,000 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 Hectares RAND MG595-5.1 SOURCE: United Nations, Afghanistan Opium Survey 2007 (Kabul: United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, 2007); United Nations, Afghanistan: Opium Survey 2005 (Kabul: United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, 2005). 40 Author interview with United Nations oﬃcials, Kabul, Afghanistan, November and December 2005. 41 United Nations, Afghanistan Opium Survey 2007 (Kabul: United Nations Oﬃce on Drugs and Crime, 2007); United Nations, Afghanistan Opium Survey 2006 (Kabul: United Nations Oﬃce on Drugs and Crime, 2006); United Nations, Afghanistan: Opium Survey 2005 (Kabul: United Nations Oﬃce on Drugs and Crime, 2005). 82 Counterinsurgency in Afghanistan Laboratories in Afghanistan converted opium into morphine base, white heroin, or one of several grades of brown heroin. Afghani- stan produced no essential or precursor chemicals for the conversion of opium into morphine base. Acetic anhydride, which is the most commonly used acetylating agent in heroin processing, was smug- gled into Afghanistan from Pakistan, India, Central Asia, China, and Europe. The largest processing labs were primarily located in Badak- shan, Nangarhar, and Helmand.42 Most of the opiates produced in Afghanistan were smuggled to markets in the West, although some was consumed in Afghanistan as both opium and heroin. Afghan heroin was traﬃcked via many routes, with traﬃckers adjusting smug- gling routes based on law enforcement and political actions. Traﬃck- ers in Afghanistan primarily relied on vehicles and overland routes to move drug shipments out of the country. Illicit drug convoys transited southern and western Pakistan, while smaller shipments of heroin were sent through the frontier provinces to Karachi for onward shipment. Most of the Afghan heroin that made its way to the United States originated in such provinces as Nangarhar and transited Pakistan.43 The drug trade has traditionally been a source of revenue for war- lords, insurgents, and criminal organizations, as well as members of the Afghan government.44 In June 2005, for example, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency and Afghan Counternarcotics Police raided the oﬃces of Sher Mohammed Akhundzada, governor of Helmand Prov- ince. They found over nine metric tons of opium stashed there.45 It is diﬃcult to assess why cultivation numbers dropped brieﬂy in 2005 before rising again in 2006, but most of the reduction appears to have been the result of persuasion and coercion. The UN Oﬃce on Drugs and Crime concluded that “the Government of Afghanistan ordered 42 Correspondence with former Afghan Minister of Interior Ali Jalali, September 5, 2006. 43 Tandy, Statement. 44 Author interview with European government oﬃcials, 2006.

The U.S. government also provided economic assis- tance. Almost three-fourths of the eradication (72 percent) took place in Nangarhar and Helmand provinces, where, in 2004, poppy cultiva- tion was ranked highest in the nation.47 Viable and sustainable income-generation programs need to be established to support eradication eﬀorts and to help convince some farmers not to cultivate. In some locations, eradication was accompa- nied by alternative livelihood programs, material support, and signiﬁ- cant political persuasion. The provinces where declines in cultivation were most striking in 2005 (Nangarhar—96 percent, Badakshan—53 percent) or where cultivation remained relatively stable (Helmand—10 percent) were the three provinces that received the largest contribu- tions for alternative development. Nangarhar received $70.1 million in assistance, and Badakshan and Helmand received $47.3 million and $55.7 million respectively.48 In spite of these temporary successes, the drug trade will remain a major challenge for the foreseeable future.49 Justice System Afghanistan’s justice system faced severe problems. Measuring the eﬀec- tiveness of the justice system is problematic in the absence of reliable data. However, World Bank data suggest that Afghanistan’s rule of law was one of the least eﬀective—if not the least eﬀective—in the world. These data measure the extent to which populations have conﬁdence 46 United Nations, Afghanistan: Opium Survey 2005, p. iii. 47 Author interview with Doug Wankel, Director of the Oﬃce of Drug Control, U.S. Embassy, Kabul, November 2005; United Nations, Afghanistan: Opium Survey 2005, p. iii. 48 United Nations, Afghanistan: Opium Survey 2005, pp. iii–iv. 49 United Nations, Afghanistan: Opium Survey 2005; United Nations, Afghanistan: Opium Survey 2004 (Vienna: United Nations Oﬃce on Drugs and Crime, 2004); United Nations, The Opium Economy in Afghanistan: An International Problem, New York: United Nations Oﬃce on Drugs and Crime, 2003; United Nations, Afghanistan: Opium Survey 2003 (Vienna: United Nations Oﬃce on Drugs and Crime, 2003), pp. 1–10; Rubin, Road to Ruin. 84 Counterinsurgency in Afghanistan in, and abide by, the rules of society.

The data show that Afghanistan’s justice system started from a low base. When the United States helped overthrow the Taliban regime in 2001, Afghanistan had the lowest-ranking justice system in the world, and it did not signiﬁcantly improve over the course of reconstruction eﬀorts. In comparison to other countries in the region—such as Iran, Pakistan, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan—Afghanistan’s jus- tice system was one of the least eﬀective.

Afghan Government and Security Forces 85 There have been several challenges to improving Afghanistan’s justice system, all of which have severely impacted the eﬃcacy of the counterinsurgency campaign. First, the central government’s inability to decrease the power of warlords and exert control over the country impacted justice sector reform. Warlord commanders, who were allowed to maintain de facto control over areas seized following the overthrow of the Taliban regime, established authority over local courts. The factional control of courts led to intimidation of centrally appointed judges. Second, the Afghan government’s inability and unwillingness to address widespread and deep-rooted corruption decreased the eﬀec- tiveness of the justice system. Corruption has long been endemic in the justice system, partly because unqualiﬁed personnel loyal to various factions are sometimes installed as court oﬃcials. The supreme court and attorney general’s oﬃce were accused of signiﬁcant corruption.51 The World Bank concluded that Afghanistan was one of the most corrupt governments in the world.52 A corrupt judiciary is a serious impediment to the success of a counterinsurgency campaign. It threat- ens to further undermine good governance and popular support, and it cripples the legal and institutional mechanism necessary to prosecute insurgents and criminals. Conclusion The quality of Afghan forces and governance capacity was mixed in Afghanistan. As noted in Chapter Two, the eﬀectiveness of counterin- surgency operations can be directly correlated with the competence of indigenous security forces and the strength of governance. This has been a recurring lesson across insurgencies since at least 1945. The recom- mendations put forth in Chapter Seven will explore in more depth U.S. capabilities that might be useful in improving indigenous capabilities. 51 Author interview with Deputy Minister of Justice Mohammad Qasim Hashimzai, Kabul, Afghanistan, June 26, 2004; Rama Mani, Ending Impunity and Building Justice in Afghani- stan (Kabul: Afghanistan Research and Evaluation Unit, 2003), p. 2. 52 Kaufmann, Kraay, and Mastruzzi, Governance Matters V, pp. 113–115. 87 CHAPTER SIX U.S. and Coalition Forces This chapter examines U.S. and coalition forces in Afghanistan. The United States initially played the lead role in the counterinsurgency campaign, though command and control over most international forces shifted to NATO in late 2006. Whereas Chapters Four and Five focused on such critical factors as the role of external support for insurgents, the legitimacy and capacity of the indigenous government, and the quality of local forces, this chapter examines six areas related directly to U.S. eﬀorts: building indigenous capacity t direct action against insurgents t intelligence t information operations t coalition operations t civil-military aﬀairs. t It argues that U.S. and coalition eﬀorts had mixed results. First, U.S. counterinsurgency capabilities were most eﬀective when they leveraged the Afghan government and indigenous forces. Provincial Reconstruc- tion Teams (PRTs) and Team Village missions were eﬀective in rebuild- ing some infrastructure and garnering popular support. Special forces were particularly eﬀective in conducting kinetic and nonkinetic opera- tions with Afghan forces, and building indigenous capacity. Human intelligence (HUMINT) and civil-military operations were often most eﬀective when conducted using indigenous forces. And indigenous leaders, such as Muslim clerics and tribal elders, were helpful in con- 88 Counterinsurgency in Afghanistan ducting information operations. Second, U.S. forces were least eﬀec- tive when they acted unilaterally and failed to leverage the indigenous government and its forces. In some areas, such as inside Pakistan, there were no sustained counterinsurgency operations by Pakistani or inter- national forces. The ability to integrate indigenous forces into opera- tions and to conduct civil-military operations during the counterinsur- gency campaign also varied depending on whether U.S. conventional or unconventional ground forces were involved. Again, special forces were particularly eﬀective. Building Indigenous Capacity Chapter Five focused on the quality and legitimacy of Afghan security forces, and argued that there were notable problems with the ANP. This section looks more speciﬁcally at the U.S. “light footprint” approach and the use of indigenous forces during operations. Metaphorically, counterinsurgency is about teaching people to ﬁsh, not about doing it for them. One of the most signiﬁcant lessons from U.S. and coalition experiences in Afghanistan is the importance of advising, training, and assisting the host nation’s ministries and security forces—and help- ing shift popular support from the insurgents to the host nation.1 For insurgent groups, popular support is an overriding strategic objective. As Mao Tse-tung argued, “The richest source of power to wage war lies in the masses of the people.”2 Counterinsurgency operations must separate insurgents from their support base. The United States adopted a two-pronged strategy for counterin- surgency operations in Afghanistan. The ﬁrst part involved the estab- lishment of an indigenous (rather than international) government. As noted in Chapter Five, public opinion polls conducted in 2003 and 2004 demonstrated that roughly 85 percent of Afghans interviewed had a “very favorable” or “somewhat favorable” view of Hamid Karzai, the 1 Herd, World War III. 2 Mao Tse-Tung, Selected Military Writings of Mao Tse-Tung (Peking, China: Foreign Lan- guages Press, 1963), p. 260. U.S. and Coalition Forces 89 ﬁrst post-Taliban president of Afghanistan.3 The United States and its allies fostered the rapid creation of a national Afghan government that included representatives from major ethnic groups. This new govern- ment began to form even before major combat operations terminated. On December 5, 2001, Afghan delegates executed the Bonn Agreement, which established an interim administration under Hamid Karzai and called for an Emergency Loya Jirga to establish a transitional author- ity. Karzai became head of state in June 2002 and president in October 2004, following the country’s ﬁrst national election. The establishment of an interim indigenous—rather than international—government gave the population a sense of ownership. As Zalmay Khalilzad, special envoy and former U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan, argued, “The fact that the Afghans played a key role in their own liberation gave them a sense of dignity and ownership of their destiny.”4 The second prong of the U.S. approach involved maintaining a light military footprint in Afghanistan. The United States did not invade Afghanistan with large numbers of forces. U.S. oﬃcials adopted a light-footprint approach for several reasons: They wanted to prevent large-scale resistance similar to what the Soviet Union encountered in the 1980s; they believed that small numbers of ground troops and air- power were suﬃcient to establish security; and they were deeply reluctant to become involved in nation-building.5 Indeed, several great powers throughout history have been defeated in Afghanistan, including the forces of Alexander the Great, Great Britain, and the Soviet Union. 3 The Asia Foundation, Voter Education Planning Survey: Afghanistan 2004 National Elec- tions (Kabul: The Asia Foundation, 2004), pp. 107–108. 4 Zalmay Khalilzad, “How to Nation-Build: Ten Lessons from Afghanistan,” National Interest, No. 80 (Summer 2005), pp. 20–21. 5 Author interview with Ambassador James Dobbins, former U.S. envoy to Afghanistan, Washington, D.C., September 21, 2004 and November 15, 2006; Richard Clarke, Against All Enemies: Inside America’s War on Terror (New York: Free Press, 2004); U.S. Senate, Afghanistan Stabilization and Reconstruction: A Status Report—Hearing Before the Committee on Foreign Relations, S.Hrg. 108-460, January 27, 2004, pp. 14, 17–18; Seymour M.

I envisioned a total of about 10,000 American soldiers, airmen, special operators, and helicopter assault crews, along with robust in-country close air support.”6 This strategy worked well during the overthrow of the Taliban government. But it had two drawbacks for the stability operation phase, which began after the overthrow of the Taliban regime. First, there were too few U.S. and Afghan government forces to stabilize the coun- try.7 Afghan militia forces had to ﬁll the security vacuum, which, in the long run, undermined the power of the central government. Figure 6.1 illustrates the per capita level of external forces in 17 stability opera- tions since World War II. The United States had one of the lowest per capita levels in Afghanistan among all these operations, which even included a number of UN operations in Africa and Asia. This created a challenge in targeting Taliban, Hezb-i-Islami, and al Qaeda insurgents in the early stages of the insurgency—such as 2002 and 2003—since there were virtually no trained and legitimate Afghan military and police. Nor were there suﬃcient forces to secure Afghanistan’s borders. Insurgent forces beneﬁted from porous borders along the Afghanistan- Pakistan frontier, as well as from assistance from sources in Pakistan and the Muslim world channeled through Pashtun tribesmen in the border region. Second, this strategy drew the wrong lesson from the Soviet expe- rience. The key lesson from the Soviet experience was not the number of Soviet forces deployed, but rather how they were used. The Sovi- ets fought the wrong war; they fought a conventional war against an unconventional opponent. As one of the most comprehensive studies of Soviet combat tactics in Afghanistan concluded, “The Soviet Army that marched into Afghanistan was trained to ﬁght within the context of a theater war against a modern enemy who would obligingly occupy 6 GEN Tommy Franks, American Soldier (New York: HarperCollins, 2004), p. 324. 7 Seth G. Jones, “Averting Failure in Afghanistan,” Survival, Vol. 48, No. 1 (Spring 2006), pp. 111–128. U.S. and Coalition Forces 91 defensive positions stretching across the northern European plain.” The Soviets used massed artillery, tanks, and ground forces to destroy acres of defense positions, and “Soviet tactics and equipment were designed solely to operate within the context of this massive strategic operation.”8 The Soviets fundamentally misunderstood the nature of counterinsur- gency warfare. They terrorized the population instead of working to win the people over to the government’s side. The United States, Paki- stan, Saudi Arabia, and other governments exploited this resentment by providing military and ﬁnancial assistance to the mujahideen.9 8 Grau, The Bear Went Over the Mountain, p. 201. 9 Coll, Ghost Wars, pp. 131, 167, 202.

A lead indigenous eﬀort is critical over the long run for successful counterinsurgency opera- tions. Even if tactically successful, a unilateral external operation may ultimately lead to failure by unseating the very indigenous capability that the external actor is trying to build. But what if there is no com- petent government force in the early stages of an insurgency? In the Afghan case, there were no Afghan army forces and no trained police. While there are no ideal options in these situations, the most eﬀective strategy may be to (a) work with those legitimate indigenous forces (especially police) that exist; (b) eﬀectively train and mentor them as quickly as possible; and (c) temporarily back-ﬁll indigenous security forces with suﬃcient numbers of U.S. and other international forces to accomplish key security tasks. These tasks include patrolling streets and villages, monitoring borders, and protecting critical infrastructure. Higher per capita levels of U.S. and coalition military and police forces might have been useful in the immediate aftermath of the Taliban’s overthrow. Preparations for the war in Iraq made this increasingly dif- ﬁcult, because U.S. troops were needed for combat operations there. Once counterinsurgency operations began, the United States experienced varying degrees of success in working with indigenous forces. Special forces were particularly successful at integrating ANA, ANP, and Afghan militia forces in virtually all aspects of combat and civil-military operations. Indigenous forces were involved in conduct- ing strike operations; interdicting enemy forces along the border; par- ticipating in reconstruction eﬀorts; and gathering intelligence.10 Some conventional units were also successful in working with indigenous forces. For example, forces from the U.S. Army’s 82nd Air- borne Division in the Bermel Valley involved Afghan militia forces and ANA forces in mine detection, mounted patrols, intelligence col- lection, vehicle checkpoints, combat operations, and search-and-seize missions. As one assessment summarized, Afghan forces “led every joint mounted patrol and most major operations,” especially since they 10 Combined Joint Special Operations Task Force Afghanistan, Counterinsurgency Opera- tions in Afghanistan, July to December 2004: Principles of Victory (Combined Joint Special Operations Task Force Afghanistan, 2005). U.S. and Coalition Forces 93 “knew the ground better and could more easily spot something that was out of place or suspicious.”11 But others were less successful. During Operation Mountain Sweep, for example, paratroopers from the 82nd Airborne conducted operations unilaterally; their heavy-handed tac- tics created signiﬁcant resentment among locals in Khowst Province.12 U.S. soldiers angered Afghan villagers on numerous occasions out of naiveté of Afghan social and cultural traditions, leading one Afghan government report to conclude, It will be diﬃcult for ever for the coalition forces to fully befriend the people. Instead they should try to minimize their contact with the local population and increasingly empower the Afghan forces to do the job. The more they try to be in touch with people the more they will be prone to make cultural mistakes.13 Direct Action Against Insurgents U.S. military forces succeeded to varying degrees in four areas of combat operations: the use of a “clear, hold, and expand” approach; the use of armed reconnaissance and raiding; close air support; and command and control arrangements. Direct action was most eﬀective when the aim was to reduce the use of force, to use force in ways con- sidered legitimate, and to get locals to use force instead of U.S. and coalition forces. Clear, Hold, and Expand Counterinsurgents achieve success by destroying insurgent forces and their political organization in a given area over the long run. This involves the permanent isolation of the insurgents from the population. 11 Buﬀaloe, Conventional Forces in Low-Intensity Conﬂict, p. 12. 12 Hy S. Rothstein, Afghanistan and the Troubled Future of Unconventional Warfare (Annap- olis, Md.: Naval Institute Press, 2006), pp. 141–143; MAJ Ron Sargent, “Strategic Scouts for Strategic Corporals,” Military Review, Vol. 85, No. 2 (March-April 2005), pp. 12–17. 13 Saleh, Strategy of Insurgents and Terrorists in Afghanistan, p. 6. 94 Counterinsurgency in Afghanistan Ideally, this isolation is not enforced on the population but maintained by and with them.14 One of the most successful approaches in Afghanistan (when it was applied) was “clear, hold, and expand.” This has also been referred to as an “ink-spot” strategy, in which military forces set up secure zones and then slowly expanded them outward like ink spots on blotting paper. Forces were assigned to contested areas to regain government presence and control and then conducted military and civil-military programs to expand the control and edge out insurgents.15 The focus was on consolidating and holding ground that was clearly pro-Afghan and procoalition (or at least anti-Taliban); protecting the government and other key resources (such as lines of communication and major cities like Kabul); and deploying coalition counterinsurgency forces to conduct oﬀensive operations in contested areas of Afghanistan, espe- cially in the south and east. The deployment of forces into insurgent areas was designed to deny sanctuary, interdict the border, and expand government and coalition presence. This is discussed in more detail in the next section. U.S. counterinsurgency forces were kept to a bare minimum and supported with civil aﬀairs and psychological opera- tions personnel. A company of infantry has sometimes been provided for area patrolling and to provide security against an immediate threat to the unit. Quick reaction forces in the form of close air support assets or reinforcing units have backed up the outposts whenever insurgent forces have threatened to overrun them. Clear, hold, and expand forces conducted operations in ever- increasing zones, or ink spots, around their bases. In the ﬁrst zone, forces tried to target and eliminate the insurgents living within the area. This required living among the local population for long dura- tions to gain its trust and support and then trying to separate the locals from the insurgents. The secondary zone was the transit and support zone for the insurgents. Clear, hold, and expand forces in Afghani- 14 Galula, Counterinsurgency Warfare, p. 77. 15 The clear, hold, and expand section draws extensively from Joseph D. Celeski, Operation- alizing COIN, JSOU Report 05-2 (Hurlburt Field, Fla.: Joint Special Operations University, 2005). U.S. and Coalition Forces 95 stan cast a wide net of operations outside their force protection zone to disrupt and interdict insurgent operations. This required patience and discreet intelligence work to ascertain the location of insurgent weapon caches, safe houses, and transit support systems. The outer zone included remote locations or areas where the population was nei- ther friendly nor hostile to the counterinsurgency unit’s eﬀorts. Occa- sional operations were conducted in these areas to show the ﬂag and to keep the population neutral to the idea of supporting the insurgents. Battalion-sized sweeps and clearing operations by conventional forces generally reaped far less than their eﬀort because of the diﬃculty of ﬁnding and ﬁxing elusive insurgents.16 However, there were some challenges with clear, hold, and expand. Pakistani forces never attempted sustained clear, hold, and expand operations in the tribal areas or in Baluchistan, especially against high- and middle-level Taliban members. Even in Afghanistan, clear, hold, and expand was limited to small areas of the country, since there were too few U.S., coalition, and Afghan forces to hold and expand large areas. Armed Reconnaissance and Raiding An additional lesson from the Afghan counterinsurgency is the need to develop an armed reconnaissance capability and a specialized raid- ing force. Armed reconnaissance is the patrolling of suspected insur- gent areas to glean information on their activities, initiate contact and conduct battle, or conﬁrm that the area is clear. Armed reconnaissance in Afghanistan was accomplished with a variety of platforms and mea- sures. These were tailored for “hunter-killer” type missions—search for, hunt down, gain contact with, and keep contact with insurgents. AC-130 gunships (operating generally at night), tactical unmanned aerial vehicles, and mounted ground reconnaissance patrols all served to accomplish this mission and keep insurgents oﬀ balance and disrupt their timing. Tactical unmanned aerial vehicles were somewhat help- 16 Celeski, Operationalizing COIN. 96 Counterinsurgency in Afghanistan ful in assisting reconnaissance, force protection, viewing avenues of approach, and positive target identiﬁcation.17 A specialized raiding force was sometimes required to conduct time-sensitive targeting beyond the scope of conventional forces. These specialized raiding forces took various forms, including counterterror- ist units, indigenous strike forces, and specially formed and trained units with personnel drawn from organic forces. In Afghanistan, raid- ing forces often required dedicated mobility platforms and a high level of access to intelligence assets. The sensor-to-shooter links worked best when noncontributing layers of decisionmakers were removed. The number-one role for these units was to target the insurgent’s organiza- tional structure and leadership; they also had a secondary role in the conduct of raids in sanctuaries in which political sensitivities precluded larger operations.18 Close Air Support Close air support provided a signiﬁcant advantage to small groups of U.S. and Afghan forces operating against insurgents. For example, close air support was extremely eﬀective when U.S. forces encountered unexpectedly strong resistance during Operation Anaconda in the Shah-i-Kot Valley. This lesson may not be applicable to all counter- insurgency operations, especially those conducted in urban areas. Also, in cases in which there is suﬃcient indigenous air capacity, the United States may choose not to provide close air support. Over the course of the Afghan counterinsurgency, a variety of aircraft provided close air support to U.S. and Afghan forces operating in the border areas. Prom- inent aircraft used include AH-64 attack helicopters, Spectre AC-130 gunships (which some Afghan insurgents referred to as the “water buf- falo”), A-10 and F-14 ﬁghters, and B-52 bombers.19 17 COL Bruce Burda, Operation Enduring Freedom Lessons Learned (Hurlburt Field, Fla.: Air Force Special Operations Command, 2003). 18 Celeski, Operationalizing COIN. 19 Bruce R. Pirnie, Alan J. Vick, Adam Grissom, Karl P. Mueller, and David T. Orletsky, Beyond Close Air Support: Forging a New Air-Ground Partnership (Santa Monica, Calif.: RAND Corporation, MG-301-AF, 2005). U.S. and Coalition Forces 97 Due to the eﬀectiveness of close air support, it will be particu- larly useful for the United States to continue to develop technological capabilities like GPS and Special Operations Forces Laser Acquisition Markers (SOFLAMs), which proved invaluable for ground forces. For much the same reason, it will also be useful to continue to develop new and more sophisticated communication equipment, including advanced receivers and transmitters that link forces in the ﬁeld to those in other areas, satellite radios carried by combat controllers to call in air strikes, and encrypted high-frequency (HF) radio.20 As one CIA oﬃ- cer involved in operations in Afghanistan remarked, “The advantage provided by SOFLAMs, smart bombs, laser-guided munitions, Spec- tre AC-130 gunships, Predator drones, sophisticated communications equipment, etc. tipped the balance militarily.”21 Command and Control Perhaps the most signiﬁcant command and control lesson that can be learned from the counterinsurgency in Afghanistan was the need to decentralize authority down to the small unit level. Command and control worked best when it was ﬂattened out from hierarchical to more horizontal levels. The shorter sensor-to-shooter links were, the better they worked. Quicker and more responsive arrangements for com- mand and control provided ﬂexibility for forces on the battleﬁeld.22 This was not always well executed. In December 2001, the com- mander of Task Force Dagger (essentially the 5th Special Forces Group plus supporting units) was in direct contact with General Franks, the combatant commander. The subordinate elements of Task Force Dagger had the most current and accurate intelligence about the situ- ation on the ground. But this changed when the 10th Mountain Divi- sion assumed operations in Afghanistan in March 2002 and again when 18th Airborne Corps took over control of the Afghanistan the- ater of operations in June 2002. By late 2002, a special forces detach- 20 On the utility of SOFLAMs and communication equipment in Afghanistan, see Berntsen, Jawbreaker, pp. 78–79, 83, 134, 266–268. 21 Berntsten and Pezzullo, Jawbreaker, p. 313. 22 Celeski, Operationalizing COIN, p. 83. 98 Counterinsurgency in Afghanistan ment’s request to conduct an operation sometimes had to be processed through six levels of command before being approved. As one general oﬃcer put it: “Too much overhead.”23 Tight command and control sometimes paralyzed initiative. Reports from some special forces mem- bers in Afghanistan indicated that U.S. forces had to obtain approval from the Combined Joint Task Force headquarters before conducting operations six kilometers beyond their ﬁre bases. In addition, all “named operations”—those other than routine travel—required approval from the Combined Joint Task Force headquarters, which could take as long as 48 hours.24 The net eﬀect of these restrictions was to impede the ﬂex- ibility and response of special forces. The mission proﬁles of future counterinsurgency operations may require adapting organizational structures in several ways. One is to empower operations at the lowest level. Well-trained, small-unit maneu- ver is important to success.25 Afghan insurgent groups frequently dis- persed their forces, making them smaller and more diﬃcult to attack. They also used more secure communication, better camouﬂage, and more eﬀective diversions.26 U.S. military operations most often suc- ceeded when leaders at the small-unit level had enough leeway, special- ized assets, and ﬁrepower to engage the population and develop their own intelligence.27 Indeed, U.S. military doctrine needs to establish far looser and more broadly distributed networks that have a high degree of individual independence and survivability.28 This means incorporat- ing into counterinsurgency doctrine and training the preparation of company and battalion commanders to lead combined-arms warfare, 23 Quoted in Rothstein, Afghanistan and the Troubled Future of Unconventional Warfare, p. 111. 24 Author interviews with U.S. forces in Afghanistan, Paktika and Paktiya, 2004 and 2005. 25 U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command, Operation Enduring Freedom, pp. 22–23. 26 Biddle, Afghanistan and the Future of Warfare; Anthony H.

U.S. and Coalition Forces 99 conduct civil-military operations, and develop and exploit their own intelligence. It also means giving infantry commanders the responsi- bility, autonomy, and distance from higher headquarters that is now only held by special forces A-team commanders. Commanders must empower small-unit leaders to deal with the challenges encountered during counterinsurgency operations, including the authority to rou- tinely make decisions currently made by battalion and brigade combat team commanders.29 Intelligence British Colonel C. E. Callwell, a military historian, wrote in his book Small Wars that “it is a very important feature in the preparation for, and the carrying out of, small wars that the regular forces are often working very much in the dark from the outset . . . What is known tech- nically as ‘intelligence’ is defective, and unavoidably so.”30 Intelligence is the principal source of information on insurgents, and has usually come from the population.31 U.S. military and intelligence forces used a variety of ways to identify insurgents: signals intelligence (SIGINT); scouts; long-range reconnaissance detachments; unmanned aerial vehi- cles; remote battleﬁeld sensor systems; Q-36 Fireﬁnder radar; Joint Land Attack Cruise Missile Defense Elevated Netted Sensor forward- looking infrared systems; and an assortment of HUMINT sources. The U.S. military’s experience in Afghanistan illustrates two key lessons: HUMINT usually provides the majority of actionable intelli- gence, especially at the tactical level; and civil-military operations can be a useful way to gather intelligence. HUMINT was a critical facet of counterinsurgency operations in Afghanistan, and Afghan intelligence and security forces were vital 29 U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command, Observations and Lessons Learned: Task Force Devil, 1st Brigade Combat Team, 82 Airborne Division (Fort Leavenworth, Kan.: U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command, January 2004), p. 2. 30 Callwell, Small Wars, p. 43. 31 Galula, Counterinsurgency Warfare, p. 72. 100 Counterinsurgency in Afghanistan in collecting intelligence. HUMINT provided the majority of action- able intelligence and resulted in successful bottom-up planning. Only rarely did units receive national-level intelligence leads; intelligence gathered at the tactical level was much more reliable.32 CIA oﬃcers, special forces, and Afghan assets armed with GPS, laser designators, and covert communication were critical in the pinpointing of targets. They helped feed intelligence to such weapons and delivery systems as joint direct-attack munitions, long-range snipers, AC-130 gunships, Afghan artillery, and thermobaric munitions.33 In addition, the U.S. military’s experience in Afghanistan demon- strates that civil-military operations can be an excellent way to gather intelligence. This was the case in various civil-military operations and local projects completed by members of the Coalition Joint Civil Mili- tary Task Force, other government agencies, and NGOs. A tactical commander can greatly beneﬁt from intelligence gathered while help- ing civil-military soldiers accomplish their mission. Locals were often so thankful for receiving health care from U.S. military forces that they became willing to assist in the ﬁght against insurgents. On numerous occasions, patients in health clinics and host nation personnel volunteered combat information to U.S. forces concerning IEDs and weapon caches, as well as enemy activity in the region.34 While intelligence gathered from locals can be useful, it should be taken with some caution. HUMINT sources may have other motives for supplying intelligence, such as tribal rivalries, and they may leak information to insurgent forces. 32 Buﬀaloe, Conventional Forces in Low-Intensity Conﬂict, p. 1. 33 Crumpton, “Intelligence and the War,” pp. 164–165. 34 In June 2003, a local who had come to a U.S. ﬁre base in the Bermel Valley for a shura told U.S. forces about foreign ﬁghters laying landmines. U.S. forces followed him to the location, dismounted before they reached the suspected mine site, found the ambush team, and initi- ated an attack. U.S. forces killed or wounded the entire patrol, gathered intelligence about insurgent techniques, and walked away with no casualties—instead of driving into a coordi- nated IED/rocket-propelled grenade ambush (U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command, Observations and Lessons Learned: Task Force Devil, p. 19). U.S. and Coalition Forces 101 Information Operations How can insurgents hope to succeed? They need to ﬁnd support among the population. This support may range from active participation in the struggle to passive approval of it. The ﬁrst basic need for an insurgent aiming at more than simply making trouble is an attractive cause. With a popular cause, the insurgent has a formidable, if intangible, asset that he can progressively transform into concrete strength.35 Religion has been a signiﬁcant part of insurgent rhetoric focused on gaining popular support. As Mullah Dadullah, a Taliban military commander killed in 2007, argued, We are not ﬁghting here for Afghanistan, but we are ﬁghting for all Muslims everywhere and also the Mujahideen in Iraq. The inﬁdels attacked Muslim lands and it is a must that every Muslim should support his Muslim brothers.36 This argument was echoed by other insurgents, such as former Tali- ban spokesman Mofti Latifollah Hakimi: “The issue of Afghanistan is connected with the ongoing war between Islam and blasphemy in the world. Mullah Mohammad is representing a huge umma [Muslim community], and a large nation is behind him.”37 Portraying the United States and other Western countries as dedicated to the destruction of Islam was a critical part of this eﬀort. As Mullah Dadullah argued, “God be praised, we now are aware of much of the U.S. plans. We know their target, which is within the general aim of wiping out Islam in this region.”38 The Taliban used young Pakistan-trained mullahs to glorify their cause in mosques in the east and south. These Taliban eﬀorts had mixed success in Afghanistan, with more success in Pakistan. Since mosques have historically served as 35 Galula, Counterinsurgency Warfare, pp. 18–19. 36 Interview with Mullah Dadullah, Al Jazeera TV, February 2006.

As one NDS report noted, There are 107 mosques in the city of Kandahar out of which 11 are preaching anti-government themes. Our approach is to have all the pro-government mosques incorporated with the process and work on the eleven anti-government ones to change their attitude or else stop their propaganda and leave the area.39 Another major factor was the public campaign by Afghan religious ﬁgures. For example, in July 2005, the Ulema Council of Afghanistan called on the Taliban to abandon violence and support the Afghan government in the name of Islam. It also called on the religious schol- ars of neighboring countries—including Pakistan—to help counter the activities and ideology of the Taliban and other insurgent organi- zations.40 A number of Afghan Islamic clerics publicly supported the Afghan government and called the jihad un-Islamic.41 Moreover, the Ulema Council and some Afghan ulema issued fatwas, or religious decrees, that unambiguously oppose suicide bombing. They argued that suicide bombing does not lead to an eternal life in paradise, does not permit martyrs to see the face of Allah, and does not allow martyrs to have the company of 72 maidens in paradise. These eﬀorts to coun- ter Taliban propaganda were made easier by the populations’ lingering resentment of the Taliban. Afghan support for the Taliban through 2007 was low. In one public opinion poll, for example, only 13 percent of Afghans had a favorable view of the Taliban.42 Insurgent groups also failed to successfully use ethnicity—espe- cially Pashtun nationalism—to gain support, in spite of a Taliban information campaign that included dropping leaﬂets, delivering night 39 Saleh, Strategy of Insurgents and Terrorists in Afghanistan, p. 8. 40 “Religious Scholars Call on Taliban to Abandon Violence,” Pajhwok Afghan News, July 28, 2005. 41 “Taliban Claim Killing of Pro-Government Religious Scholars in Helmand,” Afghan Islamic Press, July 13, 2005. 42 The Asia Foundation, Voter Education Planning Survey, pp. 107–108. U.S. and Coalition Forces 103 letters, and launching a radio station.43 This reﬂects successful U.S. and Afghan government eﬀorts to balance representation in the govern- ment among the country’s ethnic groups. The Taliban has long drawn its membership from the Pashtuns.44 In the immediate aftermath of the December 2001 Bonn Conference, the Tajiks and Uzbeks (who comprised the Northern Alliance) ﬁlled key government positions with their own personnel. They also took control of the intelligence service and ministries of defense, interior, and foreign aﬀairs. This meant that there was a signiﬁcant absence of representation from the Pashtuns, as well as the Shia Muslim Hazaras from the center. One notable excep- tion was the decision to name Hamid Karzai, a Pashtun, as interim president. By late 2003, however, the U.S. government and President Karzai made a concerted push to redress the ethnic balance at the levels of minister and deputy minister. For example, President Karzai appointed Ali Jalali, a Pashtun, as Minister of Interior, who began to appoint ethnically diverse governors and police chiefs.45 In addition, the Afghanistan and Pakistan governments encouraged the organiza- tion of traditional Pashtun councils (jirgas) to solicit the aid of local tribes in ﬁghting extremists. This included the use of tribal militias to help quell the growing power of the Taliban in Pashtun areas. The expansion of good governance and strong state institutions is probably the most eﬀective long-term solution. In sum, indigenous actors were most eﬀective in conducting infor- mation operations. The U.S. and other coalition governments tried to implement information operations to degrade insurgent decisionmak- 43 “Taliban Launch Pirate Radio Station in Afghanistan,” Agence France Presse, April 18, 2005. 44 There are no accurate statistics on ethnicity. Based on electoral results, however, Pashtuns appear to account for approximately 50 percent of Afghans.

Key objectives were to deter, discourage, and dis- suade insurgents by disrupting their unity of command while preserv- ing Afghan and coalition command. They also involved shutting down insurgent communications and networks while protecting Afghan and coalition ones. This included employing ﬁve core capabilities: electronic warfare, psychological operations, operations security, military decep- tion, and computer network operations.46 However, the most successful information operations were from indigenous actors such as religious, tribal, and political leaders—often without U.S. assistance. Working with Coalition Partners The U.S. experience working with coalition forces and other interna- tional actors was mixed. The counterinsurgency campaign—and secu- rity sector reform more broadly—was initially based on a “lead nation” approach. The United States was the lead donor nation for recon- structing the ANA; Germany was lead for police; the United King- dom was lead for counternarcotics; Italy was lead for justice; and Japan (with UN assistance) was lead for the disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration of former combatants. In theory, each lead nation was supposed to contribute signiﬁcant ﬁnancial assistance, coordinate external assistance, and oversee reconstruction eﬀorts in its sector. In practice, this approach did not work as well as envisioned. The United States provided the bulk of assistance in most security sectors—includ- ing counternarcotics, police, and the army.47 In other areas, such as the justice sector and the disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration of former combatants, there was little measurable improvement. Counterinsurgency operations are generally complex, demanding, and expensive. Even major powers like the United States need coopera- tion from others, especially on such issues as basing rights, overﬂight 46 U.S. Department of Defense, Information Operations Roadmap (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Department of Defense, 2003). 47 Author interviews with U.S., German, and British oﬃcials, Kabul, Afghanistan, Novem- ber 2005 and September 2006. U.S. and Coalition Forces 105 rights, intelligence, combat forces, economic assistance, and political support.48 Bilateral donors, international organizations, development banks, and military alliances have diﬀerent comparative advantages and can provide valuable resources to counterinsurgency. In the absence of broad multilateral support, counterinsurgency operations may not have suﬃcient military, economic, and political resources to establish secu- rity. In addition, the absence of multilateral participation may increase the likelihood that some states will undermine the operation.49 NATO’s forces in Afghanistan were generally competent. But the NATO experience in Afghanistan highlights several drawbacks with multilateral operations. One was the variation in political will of coali- tion partners. NATO’s International Security Assistance Force was severely limited by the political-military rules of engagement, which constrained each of the national contingents. Some countries, such as Canada and Britain, were reliable allies who were willing to ﬁght— and die—in Afghanistan. During Operation Medusa in 2006, for example, Canadian military forces fought a conventional battle against Taliban forces in Kandahar Province. The Taliban used crew-served weapons and rocket-propelled grenades and engaged from ﬁxed posi- tions.50 But most NATO countries, such as Germany and Norway, had national caveats that severely restricted their ability to ﬁght. Another drawback was the variation in capabilities. Several coalition countries lacked adequate enabler forces—including attack and lift helicopters, smart munitions, intelligence, engineers, medical, logistics, and digi- tal command and control—to fully leverage and sustain their ground combat power.51 48 Richard N.

In some opera- tions, such as the one carried out in Bosnia following the signing of the 1995 Dayton Peace Accords, the international community created a “high representative” to oversee reconstruction and stabilization. This did not happen in Afghanistan on either the civilian or military side. On the civilian side, there was no unity of command among the international community or U.S. agencies. Even on the military side, there were separate U.S. and NATO chains of command—even after NATO took control over much of the counterinsurgency campaign in 2006. The result was several external forces operating in the same area with diﬀerent missions and diﬀerent rules of engagement. Civil-Military Activities In his book Modern Warfare: A French View of Counterinsurgency, Roger Trinquier argues that counterinsurgency requires an interlocking system of actions—political, economic, psycho- logical, military—that aims at the [insurgents’ intended] over- throw of the established authority in a country and its replace- ment by another regime.52 One of the most innovative aspects of the Afghan counterinsurgency campaign was its civil-military programs—especially the use of PRTs.53 PRTs were made up of roughly 60 to 100 soldiers, including civil aﬀairs units, special forces, force protection units, and psychological opera- tions personnel. U.S. PRTs also included less than a half dozen State Department, USAID, and other U.S. government personnel. U.S. PRTs were generally successful in helping strengthen the reach of the central government. They also were successful in providing security at events like the Loya Jirga and during elections. They facilitated recon- 52 Trinquier, Modern Warfare, p. 6. 53 Prior to the establishment of the ﬁrst PRTs, Coalition Humanitarian Liaison Cells and U.S. Army Civil Aﬀairs Teams–Afghanistan supported humanitarian assistance, relief, and reconstruction eﬀorts throughout Afghanistan. These began in 2002. U.S. and Coalition Forces 107 struction by funding projects like school repairs or by helping the State Department, USAID, and Department of Agriculture representatives implement civilian-funded projects.54 The success of NATO PRTs varied somewhat. They tended to be more successful when working closely with the local population to coordinate reconstruction projects and secure their area of operations. The UK-led PRT in Mazar-e Sharif helped mediate several instances of interfactional ﬁghting and was successful in helping stabilize the region. In contrast, the German-led PRT in Konduz could travel only within a 30-kilometer radius and avoided areas where there was signiﬁ- cant factional ﬁghting. Based on interviews with NATO forces, this variation in PRT activity appears at least partly to be a function of domestic politics. In some countries, such as Germany, the aversion to casualties impacted PRT and broader civil-military operations. As one German soldier argued, “The German government is risk averse, especially for any thing more than peacekeeping operations. So is our population. This limits our ability—and willingness—to operate on the ground outside of our bases.”55 Both U.S. and NATO PRTs faced challenges. One was staﬃng: Most PRTs were dominated by soldiers, many of whom had little or no development experience. Civilian agencies in all NATO countries had diﬃculty convincing their personnel to spend time in a war-torn, underdeveloped country. In addition, short tours of duty—including three-month tours—made it diﬃcult for PRT members to gain a full understanding of local politics and culture. There also were too few PRTs. Five years after the overthrow of the Taliban regime, the United States and NATO were able to put PRTs in virtually all major Afghan cities, but they had little operational reach into rural areas.56 The dete- 54 Robert Borders, “Provincial Reconstruction Teams in Afghanistan: A Model for Post- Conﬂict Reconstruction and Development,” Journal of Development and Social Transforma- tion, Vol. 1 (November 2004), pp. 5–12; Michael J.

In early 2007, for example, the Kandahar PRT was involved in reconstruction eﬀorts in several small areas of the prov- ince, such as Kandahar City and Panjwari. But it was involved in virtu- ally no reconstruction or development in most of the province because of the security environment. NGOs and state agencies, such as USAID and the Canadian International Development Agency, were also not involved in reconstruction and development in most of the province. The irony in this situation is that rural areas, which were most at risk to the Taliban and where unhappiness with the slow pace of change was greatest among the population, received little or no development assistance.57 Team Village missions helped ﬁll in some of this vacuum. The term Team Village refers to a group of personnel—usually a mix of civil aﬀairs and psychological operations personnel—tasked with con- ducting civil-military operations within a larger campaign. Many also included tactical HUMINT teams, interpreters, military police, media and public aﬀairs personnel, medical personnel, and local Afghan forc- es.58 Health care operations were particularly successful in winning support among the locals. U.S. and coalition forces frequently had a line of patients for everything from mild bumps and bruises to more serious injuries and illnesses. Although these patients could be treated from the backs of the high-mobility multipurpose-wheeled vehicles, treatment was easier to administer when given in a secure compound arranged by local elders. Also, it was important to have a female medic available to treat the women and children. Otherwise, women would be either reluctant or forbidden to seek medical help, and they were usually the ones who needed it most. The use of PRTs, Team Village missions, and other civil-military activities may be one reason that public opinion polls in Afghanistan showed fairly high levels of support for the U.S. and Afghan govern- 57 Author interview with LT COL Simon Heatherington, Commander of the Kandahar Provincial Reconstruction Team, Kandahar, January 16, 2007. 58 U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command, Observations and Lessons Learned: Task Force Devil, p. 12; Buﬀaloe, Conventional Forces in Low-Intensity Conﬂict, pp. 13–14. U.S. and Coalition Forces 109 ment in the early phases of the counterinsurgency campaign.59 In one poll in 2004, for example, roughly 65 percent of Afghans had a favor- able view of the U.S. government, and 67 percent had a favorable view of the U.S. military.60 In 2005, nearly 70 percent of Afghans rated the work of the United States as either excellent or good. By 2006, nearly 80 percent of Afghans strongly or somewhat supported the work of U.S. military forces.61 However, there were several indications that support for the Afghan government began to decline in 2006 as levels of vio- lence and frustration with the slow pace of reconstruction increased. As Amrullah Saleh, head of the NDS, concluded, the Taliban succeeded in winning popular support in the east and south and setting up a foot- hold in such provinces as Helmand and Kandahar. “Who are we?” he asked. “[A] lot of people in the villages of Zabul, Helmand, Kandahar, and Oruzgan have a simple answer to this question. They say this is a corrupt government. They also say you are the government and we are the people. This black and white explanation must change.”62 Conclusion In the early stages of the counterinsurgency, U.S and coalition eﬀorts were most eﬀective when they leveraged the Afghan government and indigenous forces, including in such areas as direct action, intelli- gence, information operations, and civil aﬀairs. This meant operat- ing together with Afghan forces and building Afghan capacity. It was 59 On Afghanistan and public opinion, see The Asia Foundation, Afghanistan in 2006: A Survey of the Afghan People (Kabul: The Asia Foundation, 2006); ABC News, ABC News Poll: Life in Afghanistan (New York: ABC News, 2005); Morgan Courtney, Frederick Barton, and Bathsehba Crocker, In the Balance: Measuring Progress in Afghanistan (Washington, D.C.: Center for Strategic and International Studies, 2005); The Asia Foundation, Voter Education Planning Survey; The International Republican Institute, Afghanistan: Election Day Survey (Kabul: The International Republican Institute, October 9, 2004). 60 The Asia Foundation, Voter Education Planning Survey, pp. 107–108. 61 ABC News/BBC World Service, Afghanistan: Where Things Stand (Kabul: Afghanistan, 2006), pp. 18–19. 62 Saleh, Strategy of Insurgents and Terrorists in Afghanistan, p. 12. 110 Counterinsurgency in Afghanistan executed better in some areas than others, and better by some types of forces than others. U.S. special forces tended to be much better trained and prepared to ﬁght in an unconventional environment. There were some areas, such as close air support, in which the United States had to provide most of the capabilities. Developing a robust and techno- logically advanced Afghan air force that could conduct air strike and air mobility operations proved impractical, in large part because the Afghan Ministry of Defense could not aﬀord it. Chapter Seven will explore in more depth how these ﬁndings translate into capabilities for counterinsurgency warfare. 111 CHAPTER SEVEN Recommendations The counterinsurgency campaign in Afghanistan oﬀers a useful oppor- tunity for the U.S. military to develop capabilities to more eﬀectively conduct counterinsurgency operations. The most signiﬁcant lesson from Afghanistan is the importance of encouraging legitimate and eﬀective indigenous governments and security forces. U.S. military capabilities should focus on leveraging indigenous capabilities and building their capacity to wage a successful counterinsurgency. In some areas, such as air strikes and air mobility, this may be diﬃcult. Most policymakers— including in the United States—repeatedly ignore or underestimate the importance of locals to counterinsurgency warfare. Counterinsur- gency requires not only the capability to conduct unconventional war, but also the capability to shape the capacity of the indigenous govern- ment and its security forces. The recommendations cover eight areas: police t border security t ground combat t air strike and air mobility t intelligence t command and control t information operations t civil-military activities. t Improvements in all of these areas would increase the capability of indigenous security forces, assist in building governance capacity, and target external support. As noted in Chapter Two, these variables 112 Counterinsurgency in Afghanistan are strongly correlated with the success—and failure—of counterin- surgency eﬀorts. Table 7.1 highlights the eight areas by asking three questions. Who should be the lead actor in each area? What should the U.S. military’s role be? What are key U.S. military capabilities neces- sary to achieve success in this area? While the indigenous government needs to develop an autonomous capacity in all of these areas over the long term, this is not always possible in the near term. It may lack critical capabilities, legitimacy, resources, and political will across key areas—especially in the early phases of a counterinsurgency. Under these conditions, the U.S. military (or another external actor) may need to play a lead role until the indigenous government develops the req- uisite skills or the insurgency is defeated. This table assumes that the indigenous government will not have suﬃcient assets in key areas— especially air strike and air mobility. As Figure 7.1 illustrates, there may also be some variation in how quickly the U.S. military is willing and able to improve indigenous capacity. In some areas, such as policing, there is a strong incentive to build indigenous capacity quickly. There is evidence, for example, that the best and most eﬃcient way to prevent insurgents from gain- ing ground in the early stages of an insurgency is to have locals do it themselves—what is sometimes called in-group policing.1 Diﬀerent communities know their own members, particularly in tightly knit societies in the developing world. These communities thus overcome the intelligence challenge and enable the use of arrests or other forms of pressure with far greater discrimination. In other areas, such as air strike capability, it may not be feasible or desirable to provide the indig- enous government with technologically advanced air capabilities. Police It should be a key objective of the United States to give primacy to indigenous security forces as much as possible. In some cases, such as 1 James D. Fearon and David D.

In these cases, the international military or civilian police forces may need to assist in law enforcement missions until this capacity exists and to work as quickly as possible to build a competent indigenous police force. In other cases, such as El Salvador, there was an indigenous police capac- ity, though it still needed reforms.2 Over the long run, U.S. forces are unlikely to remain a major combatant for the duration of most coun- terinsurgencies.

Also, a lead U.S. role may elicit a strong nationalist or religious backlash among the popula- tion. In much of the Muslim world, for example, anti–U.S. sentiment is high. In Egypt and Saudi Arabia, 85 and 89 percent of the popula- tions, respectively, view the United States unfavorably. More than 60 percent of those from Morocco, Jordan, United Arab Emirates, and Lebanon also view the United States unfavorably.3 This suggests that a large U.S. presence in a predominantly Muslim country may trigger widespread unrest. Finally, a lead indigenous role can provide a focal point for national aspirations in tandem with competent security forces and good governance. A glaring deﬁciency in Afghanistan was the poor quality of the police. Due to the nature of their work, police are the ﬁrst line of defense against insurgents. They have close contact with local populations in cities and villages and will inevitably have a good intelligence picture of insurgent activity. The failure of the police to combat insurgents and undermine their support base can be fatal to counterinsurgency eﬀorts. This means that a major focus of the U.S. military and other govern- ment agencies should be to improve the competence of police through training, mentoring, and equipping. There is currently a plethora of U.S. government agencies involved in police training and equipping, such as the Department of Defense, Department of State, Department of Justice, USAID, and CIA.4 For example, the U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement and the U.S. Department of Justice’s International Criminal Investigative Training Assistance Program have foreign police training programs. However, they are plagued by a paucity of funding and civilian police. This forces the United States to either rely on contractors, such as Dyn- 3 James Zogby, 2005 Arab Attitudes Toward U.S.: Good News and Bad News (New York: Zogby International, November 7, 2005). 4 On policing during counterinsurgency and stability operations, see Oakley, Dziedzic, and Goldberg, eds., Policing the New World Disorder; Jones et al., Establishing Law and Order After Conﬂict; Perito, Where Is The Lone Ranger When We Need Him?; Bayley, Democratizing the Police Abroad. Recommendations 117 Corp, or other states or organizations, such as NATO countries or UN civilian police. Unlike the police, the ANA’s competence improved in the early stages of the counterinsurgency campaign. This was primarily a result of training provided by U.S. and other coalition forces, as well as the integration of indigenous forces into kinetic and nonkinetic operations. The same cannot be said for the ANP, which suﬀered from a lack of attention, low levels of initial funding, no initial mentoring, corruption, and a paucity of loyalty to the central government. The Department of Defense needs to be involved in rethinking police training. There are at least three options. First, the Department of Defense could create specialized police units within the U.S. military (either the Marine Corps or the Army) or provide predeployment training for an active- duty Army military police brigade. Second, the U.S. government could create police units within a federal law enforcement agency, such as the U.S. Marshals Service, that could be deployed abroad. Third, the U.S. government could fund additional positions within state and selected metropolitan police departments with the understanding that these oﬃcers would be available for deployment abroad as part of a federal eﬀort. Additional analysis is necessary to assess these options.5 Border Security Outside assistance was critical to the Afghan insurgents’ success in the early stages of the insurgency. Support from the Pakistan government, Pashtun tribes, al Qaeda, and the global jihadist network was crucial to the survivability of insurgent forces. Insurgent groups adapted their tactics and techniques during the counterinsurgency campaign, and became veritable learning organizations. They adopted suicide tactics, increasingly sophisticated IEDs, and networked organizational struc- tures involving small cells. 5 See, for example, Terrence K. Kelly, Options for Transitional Security Capabilities for America (Santa Monica, Calif.: RAND Corporation, TR-353-A, 2005). 118 Counterinsurgency in Afghanistan Since the success of insurgent groups is highly correlated with their ability to acquire external support, the U.S. military needs to improve indigenous capabilities in denying support. Perhaps the most important is improving border security. A major part of the solution is diplomatic and involves negotiations with neighboring countries to curb cross-border activity. In Afghanistan, the United States and other coalition partners failed to alter the will or capacity of the Pakistan gov- ernment to decrease cross-border activity. Some technological capabili- ties may improve border security. For uncontrolled border areas, such as the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, these capabilities might include a range of sensors and platforms to detect insurgent movement. Eﬀorts along these lines might also include training and equipping indige- nous forces to conduct patrols, utilize a range of technologies, interdict insurgent forces, and work with neighboring governments to enforce border security. There are two related areas in which capabilities are needed to deny sanctuary and target external support. One is countering insur- gent recruitment. The military and political authorities need to utilize diplomatic and other means to encourage neighboring states to curb recruitment campaigns for insurgents, close training camps, and con- duct a sustained counterinsurgency campaign that undermines pop- ular support for insurgents and captures or kills leaders and guerril- las. Insurgents’ ability to maintain sanctuary in neighboring countries can be lethal to a successful counterinsurgency eﬀort. In Afghanistan, counterinsurgency eﬀorts were limited largely to Afghan territory and did little to curb recruitment and other support in Pakistan and other neighboring countries. The second area requiring new capabilities is in countering the external ﬁnancing of insurgent groups. The U.S. government needs to continue pressuring foreign governments to curb the ﬁnancing of insur- gent groups from diaspora populations and wealthy ﬁnanciers in such regions as the Persian Gulf—in close cooperation with the Depart- ment of State, Department of Treasury, and other U.S. and coalition partners. Afghan groups received a steady stream of assistance from wealthy individuals in the Gulf and other regions. This funding stream was an important resource for insurgent groups. Recommendations 119 Ground Combat Military force is usually most eﬀective when used in ways that are con- sidered legitimate; it is also more eﬀective when used by locals and not external actors. The most eﬀective use of military force in a counterin- surgency includes two types of ground combat capabilities. First, one of the most successful approaches in Afghanistan— which was used to varying degrees—was clear, hold, and expand. This is sometimes referred to as an ink-spot strategy. Forces are assigned to contested areas to regain government presence and control and then conduct military and civil-military programs to expand the control and edge out insurgents. The focus is on consolidating and holding ground that is clearly progovernment; protecting the government and other key resources (such as lines of communication and major cities); and deploying counterinsurgency forces to conduct oﬀensive operations in contested areas. Holding territory proved to be the most diﬃcult facet of clear, hold, and expand in Afghanistan due to the low number of U.S. and local forces.6 This suggests that suﬃcient numbers of forces are needed to hold territory once it is cleared, or insurgents can retake it. Deploying forces into insurgent areas can deny them sanctuary, inter- dict the border, and expand government and coalition presence. Where possible, U.S. counterinsurgency forces should be kept to a minimum and supported with civil-aﬀairs and psychological operations units. A company of infantry can sometimes be provided for area patrolling and security for an immediate threat to the unit. Quick reaction forces in the form of close air support assets or reinforcing units should back up the outposts whenever insurgent forces threatened to overrun them. Clear, hold, and expand involves conducting operations in ever- increasing zones around military bases. The ﬁrst measure for force pro- tection is to target and eliminate the insurgents living within the inner zone—deﬁned by mission, enemy, troops, terrain, and time around their base. This requires living among the local population for long 6 On the low number of U.S. and coalition forces, see Jones, “Averting Failure in Afghani- stan”; James Dobbins, Seth G. Jones, Keith Crane, Andrew Rathmell, Brett Steele, Richard Teltschik, and Anga Timilsina, America’s Role in Nation Building: From Germany to Iraq (Santa Monica, Calif.: RAND Corporation, MR-1753-RC, 2003). 120 Counterinsurgency in Afghanistan durations to gain trust and support and the ability to separate the locals from the insurgents. The secondary zone is the transit and support zone for the insurgents. It may include remote locations or areas where the population is neither friendly nor hostile to the counterinsurgency unit’s eﬀorts. Occasional operations need to be conducted in these areas to show the ﬂag and keep the population neutral to the idea of support- ing the insurgents. In Afghanistan, battalion-sized sweeps and clearing operations by conventional forces generally reaped far less than their eﬀort warranted because of the diﬃculty of ﬁnding and ﬁxing elusive insurgents.7 Second is the development of an armed reconnaissance capability and a specialized raiding force. Armed reconnaissance is the patrolling of suspected insurgent areas to glean information on their activities, initiate contact, or conﬁrm the area is clear. Armed reconnaissance can be accomplished with a variety of platforms and measures, such as AC-130 gunships (operating generally at night), tactical unmanned aerial vehicles, and mounted ground reconnaissance patrols.8 A special- ized raiding force is sometimes required to conduct time-sensitive tar- geting beyond the scope of conventional forces. These specialized raid- ing forces may consist of a counterterrorist unit, an indigenous strike force, or a specially formed and trained unit drawn from organic forces. In Afghanistan, raiding forces often required dedicated mobility plat- forms and a high level of access to intelligence assets. The sensor- to- shooter links often worked best when noncontributing layers of deci- sionmakers were removed. Air Strike and Air Mobility Air strike and air mobility are also important. The eﬀectiveness of close air support in counterinsurgency operations such as those conducted in Afghanistan made it particularly useful for the United States to con- tinue to develop technological capabilities such as GPS-based systems 7 Celeski, Operationalizing COIN. 8 Burda, Operation Enduring Freedom Lessons Learned. Recommendations 121 and SOFLAMs, which were invaluable to ground forces. For much the same reason, it was also useful to continue to develop new and more sophisticated communication equipment, including advanced receivers and transmitters that link forces in the ﬁeld to those in other areas, satellite radios carried by combat controllers to call in air strikes, and encrypted HF radio.9 Air mobility capabilities are also likely to be important. In most developing countries, indigenous forces are unlikely to possess signiﬁcant air mobility assets, and the United States (or other external actors) may need to provide air transport to move forces into (and out of) the area of operations. Close air support provided a particularly signiﬁcant advantage to small groups of U.S. and Afghan forces operating against insurgents. This lesson may not be applicable to all counterinsurgency operations, especially those conducted in urban areas. In Afghanistan, most of the ﬁghting occurred in rural areas in which close air support was possible and eﬀective. A variety of aircraft can provide close air support to U.S. and indigenous forces, including AH-64 attack helicopters, Spectre AC-130 gunships, A-10 and F-14 ﬁghters, and B-52 bombers.10 Intelligence The problem of destroying insurgent groups and their supporters is often one of ﬁnding them. This makes access to reliable and action- able information of paramount importance. The U.S. military needs to continue developing capabilities for collecting, analyzing, and acting quickly on intelligence. In Afghanistan, the U.S. experience suggests that there are limits to applying technological solutions to intelligence challenges. Advanced technologies were sometimes helpful in identify- ing insurgents. However, insurgents were frequently able to adapt their tactics, techniques, and procedures to avoid these collection methods. This makes HUMINT particularly important—including HUMINT 9 On the utility of SOFLAMs and communication equipment in Afghanistan, see Berntsen and Pezzullo, Jawbreaker, pp. 78–79, 83, 134, 266–268. 10 Pirnie et al., Beyond Close Air Support. 122 Counterinsurgency in Afghanistan gathered by indigenous intelligence and security services, as well as local tribes and militias. Civil-military programs—such as those pro- viding medical assistance to locals—can also be utilized to build trust with locals. The development of analytical tools to process information is also important. For example, the utilization of a gridding system to map the location of insurgents and their support network has been helpful in processing intelligence into a useful operational planning tool for the U.S. military in Afghanistan. Eﬀective analysis capability is a critical component of any intel- ligence capability. Counterinsurgency operations require the develop- ment of an analytical methodology to measure the insurgency’s impact on the local population—especially the impact of the security condi- tion. A number of factors can make it diﬃcult to measure the eﬀec- tiveness of counterinsurgency operations: Progress cannot be measured by the advance of militaries across a map as in conventional warfare; focusing only on guerrilla ﬁghters misses the much broader support network; a complicated array of political, economic, social, and mili- tary factors can fuel the insurgency; and there are rarely ideal pre- deﬁned qualitative or quantitative target metrics. Unfortunately, the counterinsurgency campaign in Afghanistan often fell into two measurements traps: (1) measuring success based on outputs and inputs rather than on broader strategic outcomes; and (2) focusing on U.S., rather than Afghan, metrics. The U.S. military needs to develop outcome-based metrics to assess performance during counterinsurgency campaigns. Inputs should refer to the amount of resources used in counterinsurgency operations, such as the amount of ﬁnancial assistance and soldiers deployed. Outputs should be the ﬁrst-order results of the counterinsurgency program. These include such metrics as indigenous forces trained and insurgents killed or cap- tured. Outcomes are conditions that directly impact the local popu- lation. They should not measure what the military does, but rather represent the consequences of its eﬀorts.11 Without such an ability to measure performance, policymakers lack an objective method for judg- 11 Jones et al., Establishing Law and Order After Conﬂict. Recommendations 123 ing success and failure in ongoing crises, making midcourse correc- tions more diﬃcult. Despite these hurdles, there are reasonable measures of counter- insurgency eﬀectiveness. Key outcome indicators include the number and lethality of attacks against the local population over time and trends in public opinion polls. Metrics need to be tied to the secu- rity of the population. The tools to assess counterinsurgency outcomes remain limited. It is diﬃcult to measure popular support and security, especially in countries such as Afghanistan that have not collected sys- tematic data. However, by building such assessments into current and future assistance programs and encouraging host nations to undertake such assessments, the U.S. military will be better placed to optimize counterinsurgency operations.12 Based on the Afghanistan case, key outcome indicators might include tracking the following: Insurgent violence t . The most useful indicators here are trends over time in the number and lethality of insurgent-initiated attacks against the population. First, how many attacks have insurgents conducted and where have the conducted them? Are they rising or declining over time, and is their area of operations spreading or shrinking? Second, how lethal are their attacks over time? Are they able to kill more people (especially locals)? Short-term trends are generally not useful, since the rate of enemy attacks can ﬂuc- tuate and a decline in the rate may be caused by preparation for a larger oﬀensive.13 Crime data, including homicide rates over time, are also useful. Public opinion. t Useful indicators in this area include trends in public opinion polls that capture the perception of security among locals. Does the local population feel more (or less) safe over time? Why? Public perceptions of security can be an important indica- 12 For instance, public opinion polling can be adjusted to address perceptions of corrup- tion or judicial integrity. International advisors can assist in the development of system-wide criminal justice metrics systems as they undertake routine projects. 13 Richard Betts, Stability in Iraq? (Washington, D.C.: Central Intelligence Agency, 2005), p. 4. 124 Counterinsurgency in Afghanistan tor of the eﬀectiveness of the security forces in establishing an environment in which people and goods can circulate freely and licit political and economic activity can occur without intimida- tion. Promoting disorder is a key objective for most insurgents. Disrupting the economy and decreasing security help produce discontent among the government and undermine the strength and legitimacy of the indigenous government.14 Evidence of a relaxation of behavior stemming from fear can be particularly instructive: Do locals go out at night in their villages? Do they travel outside their villages at night? Other indicators of security t . More tactical outcome measures may also be appropriate. In Somalia, for example, the U.S. military collected such indicators as the death rate per day due to star- vation, new patients with gunshot wounds in hospitals, and the street price of an AK-47.15 All outcome measures, however, should be tied to the overall mission objectives. The ability to electronically map territory to monitor insurgent sanctuaries and their support network is another critical intelligence capability.16 In Afghanistan, a gridding system was used fairly success- fully to cover large sectors of suspected insurgent territory, as illustrated in Figure 7.2. Each square in the grid was covered by one method of surveillance and either conﬁrmed as empty or contained suspicious activity. Once suspicious activity was noted, U.S. or coalition forces continued to develop the situation, sometimes introducing additional forces in the area to destroy the threat. Timing was critical. Long hours and numerous assets were required to ﬁnd insurgent forces. Hunter- killer platforms engaged insurgent forces immediately upon their dis- covery and then continued to maintain contact while reinforcements were sent to the area. 14 Galula, Counterinsurgency Warfare, pp. 11–12, 78–79; Jones et al., Establishing Law and Order After Conﬂict. 15 U.S. Marine Corps, Small Wars Manual. 16 Trinquier, Modern Warfare; Robert R. Tomes, “Relearning Counterinsurgency Warfare,” Parameters, Vol. XXXIV, No. 1 (Spring, 2004), pp. 16–28. Recommendations 125 The gridding methodology is roughly comparable to the intelli- gence tactics used by the British in Malaya and United States in Viet- nam. In Vietnam, Secretary of Defense Robert Strange McNamara asked the CIA in 1966 to develop a technique to measure trends in “paciﬁcation” of inhabitants. The result was the Hamlet Evaluation System, which contained such objectives as whether government or insurgent forces were in a hamlet. However, it relied heavily on subjec- tive measures to gauge the quality of life of the people. The Hamlet Evaluation System reported whether hamlet-dwellers lived in some tranquility or if they were subject to harassment, intimidation, and attacks from the Viet Cong or North Vietnamese Army. The most important feature of the Hamlet Evaluation System was the fact that two separate parties prepared two separate reports Figure 7.2 Example of Grid Methodology RAND MG595-7.2 Guerrilla Logistics Financial and political support 126 Counterinsurgency in Afghanistan independently of one another. The U.S. Senior District Advisor and his counterpart, the Vietnamese District Commander, each prepared a report for his respective chain of command. This was intended to ensure that the two did not cooperate to bias the conclusions. After the reports were submitted, they were compared at the Province Senior Advisor level, then at the Military Assistance Command–Vietnam/ Civil Operations for Revolutionary Development Support headquar- ters in Saigon. The questions were given a mathematical compilation to provide a statistical average for each hamlet. These were then accumu- lated for each village, city, district, and province. A hamlet or village that was rated secure or “under government inﬂuence” was classiﬁed as A, B, or C. Those hamlets under guerrilla inﬂuence were given a D or E. Analyzing data from the Hamlet Evaluation System, as well as data on unit operations, showed how maneuver battalion days of operations in a given area contributed little to population security. Big-unit sweeps did not promote paciﬁcation unless U.S. forces stayed in the area.17 Command and Control The mission proﬁles of future counterinsurgency operations may require adapting organizational structures in several ways. One is to empower operations at the lowest level. Well-trained small-unit maneuver is important to success.18 Competent insurgent groups can disperse their forces, make them smaller and more diﬃcult to attack, and acquire more secure communication, better camouﬂage, and more eﬀective diversions.19 U.S. military operations may be more likely to succeed when leaders at the small-unit level have enough leeway, specialized 17 Andrew F. Krepinevich, The Army and Vietnam (Baltimore, Md.: Johns Hopkins Univer- sity Press, 1986). 18 U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command, Operation Enduring Freedom, pp. 22–23. 19 Biddle, Afghanistan and the Future of Warfare; Cordesman, The Ongoing Lessons of Afghan- istan, pp. 122–123. Recommendations 127 assets, and ﬁrepower to engage the population, develop their own intel- ligence, and defeat the enemy in combat.20 Indeed, U.S. military doctrine needs to establish far looser and more broadly distributed networks that have a high degree of individual independence and survivability.21 This means incorporating into coun- terinsurgency doctrine and training the preparation of company and battalion commanders to lead combined-arms warfare, conduct civil- military operations, and develop and exploit their own intelligence. It also means giving infantry commanders the responsibility, autonomy, and distance from higher headquarters that is now held only by special forces A-team commanders. Commanders must empower small-unit leaders to deal with the challenges encountered during counterinsur- gency operations, including the authority to routinely make decisions currently made by battalion and brigade combat team commanders.22 Command and control works well when it has been ﬂattened out from a hierarchical to a more horizontal level. The shorter sensor-to-shooter links are, the better they work. Quicker and more responsive arrange- ments for command and control provide ﬂexibility for forces on the battleﬁeld.23 This was not always well executed in Afghanistan. At the strategic level, command and control presented three sig- niﬁcant challenges in Afghanistan. One was overall coordination of the counterinsurgency. Where possible, the indigenous government should be in charge of counterinsurgency eﬀorts overall. While international civilian personnel and military forces will retain separate chains of command from the indigenous government, international actors need to support the preeminent role of the indigenous government. The second strategic-level challenge concerns command and control among international forces. As noted Chapter Six, there were separate U.S. and NATO chains of command. The result was several external forces operating in the same area with diﬀerent missions and 20 Buﬀaloe, Conventional Forces in Low-Intensity Conﬂict, p. 4. 21 Cordesman, The Ongoing Lessons of Afghanistan. 22 U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command, Observations and Lessons Learned: Task Force Devil, p. 2. 23 Celeski, Operationalizing COIN, p. 83. 128 Counterinsurgency in Afghanistan diﬀerent rules of engagement. As demonstrated in other cases, such as Somalia and Sierra Leone, this practice engenders duplication and risks confusion, miscommunication, and, in some instances, unnecessary casualties. A better model may be that followed by the United States in Haiti in 1994 and Australia in East Timor in 1999, in which the U.S.- and Australian-led entry forces, respectively, were drawn down and incorporated into a uniﬁed force with a single chain of command.24 The third strategic-level command and control challenge in the Afghan counterinsurgency was a lack of coordination within the U.S. eﬀort. Successful counterinsurgency campaigns require a combination of military and political capabilities. But coordination between the U.S. military and civilian agencies operating in Afghanistan was prob- lematic. This suggests a need to get civilian agencies better engaged and coordinated on the ground with the military. Overcoming this challenge will also require rethinking the organizational structure of the counterinsurgency campaign. There are several potential options, though additional analysis is necessary to assess them. The ﬁrst is to put a civilian in charge of the counterinsurgency eﬀort, perhaps the U.S. ambassador in the country in which the insurgency is taking place. Or, following the model of several British-led counterinsurgencies, it could be a special envoy (or high commissioner) with command and control authority. Under both of these options, the top military oﬃcial would be subordinate to the civilian ﬁgure. Indeed, British civilian oﬃcials were in control of emergencies and were responsible for the broader political strategy. The British Army operated under civilian control and accepted the requirement of employing minimum force. Another option is to give the military command and control responsibilities for the counterinsurgency campaign. The ﬁnal option is to establish an interagency working group, which includes both civilian and mili- tary oﬃcials, that has overall responsibility for the counter insurgency campaign. 24 See, for example, James Dobbins, Seth G. Jones, Keith Crane, and Beth Cole DeGrasse, The Beginner’s Guide to Nation-Building (Santa Monica, Calif.: RAND Corporation, MG- 557-SRF, 2007). Recommendations 129 Information Operations Indigenous groups are more likely to be eﬀective in inﬂuencing locals and countering insurgent ideology than the U.S. military or other inter- national actors are. It is critical to understand who holds power, who the local population trusts, and where locals get their information— and then to target these forums. In some cases, such as in Afghani- stan, religious leaders and tribal elders wield the vast majority of power. This means providing assistance to credible indigenous groups, such as Muslim clerics or tribal elders, that can eﬀectively counter jihadist pro- paganda. These groups do not necessarily have to be supportive of the United States, but they do need to oppose insurgents and have cred- ible inﬂuence among the population. Much of this funding may have to be indirect to protect their credibility. Assistance could be directed to indigenous media, political parties, student and youth organiza- tions, labor unions, and religious ﬁgures and organizations that meet at least two criteria: (1) they have a notable support base in the local population; and (2) they oppose insurgent groups and insurgent ide- ology. This approach has some parallels with U.S. eﬀorts during the Cold War to balance the Soviet Union by funding existing political, cultural, social, and media organizations in areas such as Central and Eastern Europe. Insurgents sometimes make religion a signiﬁcant part of their rhetoric to gain popular support. Since mosques have historically served as a tipping point for major political upheavals in Afghanistan, Afghan government oﬃcials have targeted mosques. The Ulema Council of Afghanistan called on the Taliban to abandon violence and support the Afghan government in the name of Islam. They also called on the reli- gious scholars of neighboring countries—including Pakistan—to help counter the activities and ideology of the Taliban and other insurgent organizations. A number of Afghan Islamic clerics publicly supported the Afghan government and called the jihad un-Islamic. Moreover, the Ulema Council and a number of Afghan ulema have issued fatwas, or religious decrees, that unambiguously oppose suicide bombing. Indige- nous eﬀorts to inﬂuence the population, especially credible actors such as Muslim clerics and tribal leaders, were the most successful. 130 Counterinsurgency in Afghanistan Civil-Military Activities The Afghan government suﬀered from signiﬁcant governance prob- lems, such as its failure to stem the rising drug trade and corruption in key areas like the justice system. While civilian agencies should lead eﬀorts to rebuild the justice system, the military needs to play an important role as well. This means establishing civil-aﬀairs teams that can work in key areas of the justice system, such as establishing courts to prosecute insurgents, terrorists, and major criminals involved in such activities as drug traﬃcking. Eﬀectively prosecuting “spoilers”— including insurgents—is critical to the success of a counterinsurgency campaign. The failure to adequately deal with these individuals under- mines counterinsurgency eﬀorts. In addition, pretrial detention facili- ties and prisons are often in poor condition in developing countries. Compounding this problem, donor states may be reluctant to become involved in rebuilding a system with a reputation for signiﬁcant human rights violations. The military can help ﬁll this gap. Reconstruction teams should be a core component of counterin- surgency operations, and involve both military and civilian personnel.25 In the U.S. government, this includes personnel from such organiza- tions as USAID and the Departments of State, Justice, Treasury, and Agriculture. These teams should become involved in a wide variety of projects that range from assisting the local population with basic health care; helping improve basic services such as water and electricity; and rebuilding schools, government buildings, and hospitals. Reconstruc- tion programs should be designed to gain support for the indigenous government, rather than for the United States or other external actors. As Israeli General Moshe Dayan argued, “foreign troops never win the hearts of the people” and generally do not gain support for the host government.26 In areas where there is signiﬁcant insurgent violence, the U.S. military may need to provide a greater percentage of civil- 25 Khalilzad, “How to Nation-Build: Ten Lessons From Afghanistan.” 26 Quoted in Wilensky, Military Medicine to Win Hearts and Minds, p. 132. Also see General Moshe Dayan, Folder 488, 1-31 May 1968, #32 History File, Box 34, Record Group 319, National Archives and Records Administration. Recommendations 131 military assistance, since they are better prepared to operate in hostile environments. These nonkinetic operations are a critical weapon in an indige- nous government’s battle for popular support. The U.S. military should deploy civil aﬀairs units with training and experience in such areas as public administration, public safety, public health, and legal systems. Again, the focus of the U.S. military and other international actors should be to improve the indigenous government’s ability to rebuild and provide essential services—not to do it for them. This is a key aspect of any attempt to secure popular support and legitimacy for the government. One of the most innovative aspects of the Afghan coun- terinsurgency campaign was the inclusion of civil-military programs— especially the use of PRTs. The PRT concept can help strengthen the reach of the central government and rebuild essential services. PRTs can facilitate reconstruction by funding projects such as school repairs or by helping Department of State, USAID, and Department of Agriculture representatives to implement civilian-funded projects. However, there are several barriers to the successful implementation of PRTs. One is staﬃng hurdles. Short tours of duty—such as three-month tours— make it diﬃcult for PRT members to develop an understanding of local politics and culture. A second is a scarcity of PRTs, which need to reach beyond urban areas into rural areas, where insurgent support may be strongest. In Afghanistan, they had little operational reach in rural areas. Since insurgents are often better able to build support net- works and capture territory in rural areas, PRTs need to spread to rural areas. This is where Team Village missions can be eﬀective. In Afghani- stan, Team Village units—which usually included a mix of civil aﬀairs and psychological operations personnel—were tasked with conducting civil-military operations within a larger campaign. Team Villages also included tactical HUMINT teams, interpreters, military police, media and public aﬀairs personnel, medical personnel, and local Afghan forc- es.27 Health care operations can be particularly successful in winning 27 U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command, Observations and Lessons Learned: Task Force Devil, p. 12; Buﬀaloe, Conventional Forces in Low-Intensity Conﬂict, pp. 13–14. 132 Counterinsurgency in Afghanistan support among the locals. Local villagers can be treated for everything from mild bumps and bruises to more serious injuries and illnesses. Although these patients can be treated from the backs of the high- mobility multipurpose-wheeled vehicles, such care is better tended in a secure compound arranged by the locals. Also, it is key to have a female medic available to treat the women and children. Good governance involves the provision of essential services to the population by a central authority in a timely manner. This includes the process by which those in authority are selected, monitored, and replaced (the political dimension); the government’s capacity to eﬀec- tively manage its economic resources and implement sound policies (the economic dimension); and the respect of citizens and the state for the country’s institutions (the institutional dimension).28 The U.S. military is generally not the primary actor for governance and insti- tution-building during counterinsurgency operations. Nonetheless, it should play a critical role in encouraging good governance by helping the indigenous authorities deal with corruption, improve the criminal justice system, and disarm militias. In the long term, poor governance can undermine a counterinsurgency eﬀort by undermining popular support for the government. Thus it is important to ensure coordina- tion between other actors involved in governance: UN agencies such as the UN Development Programme; regional organizations such as the Asian Development Bank, the European Union, and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe; and a broad range of non- governmental organizations. The failure of governance in key prov- inces—such as Helmand and Kandahar—has seriously undermined counterinsurgency eﬀorts in Afghanistan. In 1940, the U.S. Marine Corps’ Small Wars Manual percep- tively noted that “the history of the United States shows that in spite of the varying trend of the foreign policy of succeeding administra- tions, this Government has interposed or intervened in the aﬀairs of other states with remarkable regularity.” It continued with the conten- tion that since these types of missions would likely recur in the future, “it is well that the United States may be prepared for any emergency 28 Kaufmann, “Myths and Realities of Governance and Corruption.” Recommendations 133 which may occur.”29 This assessment is just as true today as it was in the 1940s. Indeed, the United States has been involved in numerous coun- terinsurgencies throughout its history in Latin America, the Middle East, Africa, Europe, and Asia. The challenge is to improve its ability to engage more eﬀectively in counterinsurgency operations in the future. 29 U.S. Marine Corps, Small Wars Manual. 135 APPENDIX Insurgencies Since 1945 China 1946–1950 Greece 1945–1949 Philippines 1946–1952 Vietnam 1945–1954 Burma 1948– Malaya 1950–1956 Colombia 1948–1962 China/Tibet 1950–1951 Kenya (Mau Mau) 1952–1956 Cuba 1958–1959 Algeria 1954–1962 Lebanon 1958–1958 Indonesia (Darul Islam) 1958–1960 Congo/Katanga 1960–1965 Guatemala 1968–1996 South Africa (African National Congress) 1983–1994 Ethiopia/Eritrea 1974–1992 Laos 1960–1973 136 Counterinsurgency in Afghanistan Vietnam 1960–1975 Iraq (Kurds) 1961–1974 Yemen 1962–1969 Mozambique 1964–1974 Guinea–Bissau 1962–1974 Angola 1962–1974 Colombia 1963– Zimbabwe (Rhodesia) 1972–1979 Dominican Rep. 1965–1965 Nigeria/Biafra 1967–1970 Argentina (Montañeros) 1973–1977 Cambodia 1970–1975 Northern Ireland 1969–1999 Philippines (New Peoples Army) 1972–1994 Jordan (Black September) 1970–1970 Philippines (Moro National Liberation Front) 1968– Pakistan/Bangladesh 1971–1971 Pakistan/Baluchistan 1973–1977 Angola (Unita) 1975– Morocco (Polisario) 1975–1988 Indonesia/East Timor 1975–1999 Namibia 1960–1991 Uruguay 1963–1973 Philippines (Moro Islamic Liberation Front) 1977– Insurgencies Since 1945 137 India Naxalite 1980– Nigeria/Biafra II 1999– Afghanistan 1996–2001 Lebanon 1975–1990 India Northeast 1952– Indonesia/Aceh 1999– Mozambique (Renamo) 1976–1995 Sri Lanka (Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam) 1983– Nicaragua 1978–1979 Afghanistan 1978–1992 Cambodia 1978–1992 El Salvador 1979–1992 Somalia (anti-Barre) 1981–1991 Senegal 1989– Peru 1981–1992 Nicaragua (Contras) 1981–1988 Turkey (Partiya Karkerên Kurdistan) 1984–1999 Sudan (Sudan People’s Liberation Army) 1983– Uganda 1993– Papua New Guinea/Bougainville 1988–1998 Liberia 1989–1996 India/Kashmir 1989– China/Xinjiang 1991– Rwanda 1990– 138 Counterinsurgency in Afghanistan Moldova 1992–1994 Sierra Leone 1991– Somalia 1991– Algeria (Groupe Islamique Armé) 1992– Croatia/Krajina 1992–1995 Afghanistan 1992–1901 Tajikistan 1992–1997 Georgia/Abkhazia 1992–1994 Azerbaijan/Ngo-Kar 1992–1994 Bosnia 1992–1995 Burundi 1993– Pakistan (Sindhis versus Mahajirs) 1993–1999 Chechnya 1994–1996 Congo (Kabila) 1996–1997 Nepal 1997– Congo 1998– Chechnya II 1999– Serbia/Kosovo 1998–1999 Nigeria/communal 1999– Israel 1996– Afghanistan 2001– Ivory Coast 2002– Sudan/Darfur 2002– Iraq 2003– 139 References ABC News.

The purpose of the symposium was to distill lessons and insights from past insurgent conﬂicts that might help to inform and shape the U.S. involvement in Vietnam and to foster the eﬀective prosecution of other future counterinsurgency campaigns. To gather these lessons and insights, rand brought to the same conference table twelve U.S. and allied oﬃcers and civilian oﬃcials who had expertise and a proven record of success in some aspects of guerrilla or counterinsurgency warfare. As their biographies will testify, the accomplishments and backgrounds of the symposium’s for- mal participants gave their views signiﬁcant credibility. Each participant could claim ﬁrsthand experience with guerrilla or counterinsurgent operations in one or more of the following post-World War II conﬂicts: Algeria, China, Greece, Kenya, Laos, Malaya, Oman, South Vietnam, and the Philippines. Three of the participants had led or oper- ated with anti-Japanese guerrilla or guerrilla-type units in Burma and the Philippines during World War II. During ﬁve days of meetings, the participants exchanged views on a wide spectrum of topics relating to the political, military, economic, intelligence, and psychological measures required to defeat insurgencies. Convinced that the fundamental verities of eﬀective counterinsurgency policy and practice that were elucidated by the participants remain as valid today as they were 44 years ago, rand decided to republish the sympo- sium proceedings. Among the insights that emerged from the discussions, the reader will ﬁnd a num- ber of counterinsurgency best practices that seem especially germane to the insurgency challenges confronted today by the United States and its allies. These include discus- sions of the counterinsurgent’s need to: iv COUNTERINSURGENCY: A SYMPOSIUM • Identify and redress the political, economic, military, and other issues fueling the insurgency • Gain control over and protect the population, which the counterinsurgent must see as the prime center of gravity in any counterinsurgency conﬂict • Establish an immediate permanent security presence in all built-up areas cleared of enemy forces • Accumulate extensive, ﬁne-grained human and other intelligence on insurgent plans, modes of operation, personnel, and support networks • Avoid actions that might antagonize the population • Convince the population that they represent the “winning side” and intend to prevail until complete victory is secured The participants also discussed measures to control borders (particularly eﬀective in Algeria), techniques for countering and conducting ambushes, and the utility of mount- ing “false insurgent” operations. They also addressed the issue of when and how the counterinsurgent knows he is winning, and came to a consensus that the most important indicators of success were when the people voluntarily cooperated in providing intelli- gence and were willing to disregard insurgent orders. While there were points of diﬀerence among the participants, there was far more accord than disagreement. Indeed, the participants clearly shared a common view about the fundamentals of eﬀective counterinsurgency. One of the UK participants, Lt Col Frank Kitson, later described how he was struck by the unity of outlook: “Although we came from such widely divergent backgrounds, it was if we had all been brought up together from youth. We all spoke the same language. Probably all of us had worked out theories of counterinsurgency procedures at one time or another, which we thought were unique and original. But when we came to air them, all our ideas were essentially the same. We had another thing in common. Although we had no diﬃculty in making our views understood to each other, we had mostly been unable to get our respective armies to hoist in the message.”1 Unfortunately, Frank Kitson’s observation about the diﬃculty in persuading “armies to hoist in the message” has proven all too true in the case of U.S. and allied indigenous military forces ﬁghting insurgencies. Counterinsurgency best practices were frequently 1Frank Kitson, Bunch of Five, London: Faber & Faber, 1977, pp. 200-201.

Hopefully, the republication of this symposium will stimulate greater interest in their observance in the future. Stephen T. Hosmer April, 2006 FOREWORD TO THE NEW EDITION v vii PREFACE This is a report on the Symposium on Counterinsurgency that was held at The rand Corporation’s Washington Oﬃce during the week of April 16, 1962. The Symposium was sponsored by the Advanced Research Projects Agency, and was organized and chaired by Stephen T. Hosmer of rand’s Social Science Department. The basic rationale in undertaking the Symposium was that, rather than approach the problems of guerrilla and counterguerrilla warfare theoretically and academically, it might be useful to draw on the knowledge of men of recent and direct experience in counterinsurgency, with a view to assembling a large body of detailed information and judgment on the multifarious aspects of this inadequately explored form of conﬂict. It was hoped that such a pragmatic approach would not only provide fruitful insights into earlier struggles but would, above all, yield valuable lessons for the future. The main criterion in the selection of the participants, therefore, was that each have ﬁrsthand and successful experience in some phase of insurgent or counterinsurgent operations. rand was most fortunate in being able to bring together the particular group of mili- tary and civilian experts who constituted the Symposium.* The biographic information about the participants’ background and achievements reﬂects not only their unusually high caliber but also the diversity of their experience, knowledge, and special skills. Some of these men had been combat leaders; some occupied headquarters positions; still others were engaged in highly specialized activities such as civic action or operations research into weapons and communications technology. Together, they combined the experience of some nine diﬀerent theaters of insurgency during the last twenty years, including such key areas as Malaya, the Philippines, South Vietnam, Kenya, and Algeria. *Since not all the participants were able to attend every meeting, the schedule was so planned as to permit those whose time was limited to be present at the discussions that bore on their own experience and special interests. viii COUNTERINSURGENCY: A SYMPOSIUM To derive maximum beneﬁt from this wealth and variety of expertise, the Sympo- sium was conducted in a manner that would encourage the freest possible exchange of ideas and experiences. Hence there were no formal papers, but only informal roundtable discussions in which the members of the group were asked to present their opinions and to draw freely on their recollections of problems encountered and techniques employed in their areas of operations. To give the Symposium a degree of structure and continuity, “Proposed Terms of Reference” (see Appendix) were drafted and distributed to the participants in advance of the meetings to serve, not as a rigid agenda, but as a general outline and guide to the discussions. As was inevitable in view of the scope and complexity of the subject, not all aspects of counterinsurgency could be covered exhaustively. Some that might have been treated in greater detail, had time permitted it, were only touched on in passing, and some aspects were not discussed at all. Then again, several points were more prominently debated than had been envisaged. The summary of the discussions, which constitutes the present report, follows the order and progression of the meetings as closely as possible in the hope of conveying something of the spontaneous character of the talks and the manner in which certain ﬁndings and generalizations evolved. It is hoped that the detailed subheadings at the beginning of each section will prove useful in orienting the reader whose interest may be conﬁned to particular questions. (The ten sections of the report correspond to the ten half-day sessions of the Symposium, and a listing of the participants present appears at the beginning of each section.) The report was prepared by our rapporteur, Sibylle Crane, who attended all sessions and was able also to consult the taped recordings of the proceedings. Each participant in the Symposium had an opportunity to read and amend in draft form all statements in the report that were attributed to him. It is well to realize that, with a few exceptions, the oﬃcers and civilians who took part in the Symposium were intimately associated only with particular phases of the larger campaigns in which they served, and their experience was often conﬁned to one geographic sector of the total theater. Their generalizations, as the participants themselves were careful to point out, necessarily reﬂect each individual’s personal vantage point in time and place and may not in every case be equally valid for all periods and regions of the conﬂict to which they refer. As the following report shows, the Symposium succeeded in yielding a variety of informed viewpoints and signiﬁcant individual experiences, which in turn led to many valuable cross references, comparisons, and at times disagreements. However, the talks also revealed surprisingly large areas of agreement and community of experience. Although no conscious attempt was made to establish a consensus on a given idea or tech- nique, or to formulate universally valid principles, the participants recorded a high degree of concurrence—often unanimity—on major premises and principles of operations, as well as some unexpected similarities of experience. To the extent compatible with the for- mat of this report, such areas of understanding, agreed principles, and parallel experience have been stressed editorially. The rand Corporation owes a debt of profound gratitude to the participants who, in spite of pressing commitments elsewhere, found the time to contribute so generously to this Symposium. It is hoped that those who must deal with current and future prob- lems of counterinsurgency will ﬁnd some proﬁt in the summary of an exchange of views by highly articulate practitioners of an art of warfare that is assuming an ever-growing importance in our military thinking and planning.

COL. CHARLES T. R. BOHANNAN, AUS-RET., has been intimately associated with the major events in the Philippines in the last two decades, playing an important role, in particular, in the struggle against the communist (Hukbalahap) insurgent movement of the postwar period. A geologist, archaeologist, and cartographer prior to his enlistment in the U.S. Army in 1941, he saw combat in various Pacific theaters during World War II and took part in the liberation of the Philippine Islands from the Japanese. He returned to the newly independent Philippine Republic in 1946 and, for the next three years, participated in the anti-Huk campaign as a coun- terintelligence officer, thus gaining firsthand, authoritative knowledge of the nature of guer- rilla warfare and the principles and techniques of counterinsurgency. In the later phases of the campaign, he served in Manila as JUSMAG advisor on unconventional operations to the Armed Forces of the Philippines. Col. Bohannan, who now makes his home in the Philippine Islands, is the coauthor, with Col. Napoleon D. Valeriano, of Counterguerrilla Operations: Lessons from the Philippines, published by Frederick A. Praeger, Inc., New York, 1962. COL. WENDELL W. FERTIG, USA-RET., won great distinction during World War II as a guerrilla leader in the Philippines. A mining engineer and army reserve officer, he was su- perintendent of the largest iron mine in the Philippines at the outbreak of the war, when he volunteered for active duty with the Corps of Engineers of the Philippines Department of the U.S. Army. After the fall of the Philippines, Col. Fertig organized and commanded the Philip- pine-American guerrilla forces on Mindanao and, during the next three years of the Japanese occupation, developed them into a highly trained and effective force. His efforts did much to pave the way for the return of the American forces to Mindanao in 1945. Between the end of the war and his retirement from the service in 1956, Col. Fertig’s assignments included a tour as professor of military science and tactics at the Colorado School of Mines (1947-1951); the post of Deputy Chief of Psychological Warfare, Department of the Army (1951-1953); and that of Deputy Director of the Joint Staff of PROVMAAG-Korea (1954-1955). Today, Col. Fertig is a practicing mining-engineer consultant in Denver, Colorado. He is a frequent lecturer on guerrilla and psychological warfare and has issued a number of publications on the subject in the last ten years. LT. COL. DAVID GALULA has had an unusually wide variety of experience in a number of theaters of revolutionary warfare. Having graduated from the French military academy at Saint- Cyr in 1940, he served in North Africa, France, and Germany during World War II. From 1945 to 1948 he was posted to China (part of that period as Assistant Military Attaché), and thus was able to acquaint himself at firsthand with communist guerrilla strategy and tactics in the civil war. In 1949/1950 Col. Galula was a military observer with the U.N. Special Commission on xx COUNTERINSURGENCY: A SYMPOSIUM the Balkans (UNSCOB) during the civil war in Greece, which ended with the defeat of the com- munist rebellion. He subsequently served for nearly five years as his country’s Military Attaché in Hong Kong. In 1956, at the height of the Algerian rebellion, Col. Galula was given command of a company assigned to the district of Kabylie, east of Algiers, an area of intensive FLN opera- tions, which he succeeded in clearing militarily and returning to governmental control in the two years of his command. From 1958 until he came to the United States in April 1962, except for six months spent at the Armed Forces Staff College at Norfolk, Virginia, Col. Galula worked at general military headquarters in Paris on various aspects of unconventional warfare and, in particular, the war in Algeria. In the spring of 1962 he joined the Center of International Affairs at Harvard University as a research associate. CAPT. ANTHONY S. JEAPES has taken an active part in counterinsurgent campaigns in Ma- laya and in the Middle East. A graduate of the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst, he was commissioned into the Dorset Regiment in 1955, and shortly thereafter went with his battalion to Germany as part of the 4th Infantry Division. His next post two years later was that of in- structor to a “Junior Leaders” unit at Plymouth, England. In 1958 he was selected to attend the Special Air Service course in Wales and joined the elite 22nd SAS Regiment in the campaign against the Chinese terrorists in Malaya. The special function of that regiment, for which its members were carefully selected and trained, consisted in having small units penetrate the guer- rilla-infested deep jungle to spot and ambush terrorist concentrations and collect intelligence from the aborigines inhabiting the areas. In 1959 Capt. Jeapes participated in the defeat of the rebellion in Oman, before returning to the United Kingdom with the 22nd SAS. Since October 1961 he has been at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, as SAS exchange officer with the 7th Special Forces. LT. COL. FRANK E. KITSON, MBE, MC, has taken part in the British counterinsurgency campaigns in both Kenya and Malaya. Having spent his first seven years as an officer of the Brit- ish infantry chiefly in occupied Germany, he was posted to Kenya in mid-1953, at the height of the Mau Mau rebellion. His primary task was to help the intelligence branch of the police obtain the information needed by the security forces in their fight against the terrorist gangs. In the course of the next two years Col. Kitson developed and perfected a novel approach and technique for the collection and utilization of the special kind of intelligence that is indispens- able in guerrilla warfare. He was able subsequently to apply this experience in the antiterrorist campaign in Malaya, where he had command of an infantry company in 1957. In recent years Col. Kitson’s assignments have included a year at the British Army Staff College at Camberley; a post in the Military Operations Branch of the War Office, responsible for the Middle East; a tour as army instructor at the Royal Naval College at Greenwich, England; and several months at the Armed Forces Staff College at Norfolk, Virginia. Col. Kitson has recorded his experience in Kenya in a book entitled Gangs and Counter-gangs, published by Barrie and Rockliff, London, 1960. BRIG. GEN. EDWARD G. LANSDALE, USAF, who became an officer in the U.S. Army in 1943 after having served with the Office of Strategic Services, has been involved in many of the insurgent and counterinsurgent efforts that have concerned the United States in the last twenty years. From 1945 until 1948 he was Chief of the Intelligence Division at Headquarters AFWESPAC in the Philippines (later the Philippine Ryukyus Command). He returned to the Philippines in 1950 to become the JUSMAG liaison officer and, in the course of time, a close personal friend and advisor to the newly appointed Secretary of Defense Magsaysay. In that capacity he helped the Philippine Armed Forces develop psychological operations, civic action, and prisoner-rehabilitation programs in the struggle against the communist Huks. Later, in Southeast Asia, Gen. Lansdale was an advisor on special counterguerrilla operations on Gen- eral O’Daniel’s mission to the French forces in Indochina (1953). He subsequently served with MAAG-Vietnam in Saigon (1954-1956), advising the Vietnamese government on internal secu- rity problems, psychological operations, intelligence, civic action, and the refugee program, and in the process became a personal friend of President Diem. Since 1957 Gen. Lansdale has served in a number of posts in Washington. He became Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense in 1957; joined the staff of the President’s Committee on Military Assistance in 1959; and in 1961 was appointed to his present position as Assistant to the Secretary of Defense. RUFUS C. PHILLIPS, III has an impressive background in the fields of psychological warfare and civic action in Southeast Asia. In the middle 1950’s, as a member of the Military Aid Advi- sory Group and psychological warfare advisor to the army of South Vietnam, he was responsible for organizing the Vietnamese army’s psychological warfare branch and also had a major role in the pacification operations in the previously communist-held areas of South Vietnam. In 1957 Mr. Phillips went to Laos on behalf of the ICA and spent the next two years working with the Lao government in launching and directing a “civic action” program that was designed, much like the earlier effort in Vietnam, to win the loyalty of the population in rural areas for the legitimate government and away from the Communists through political, economic, and psy- chological means. After an interim of three years with a private firm of consulting engineers in Washington, D.C., Mr. Phillips has recently returned to Southeast Asia once again. In Septem- ber 1962, following a brief assignment for AID to survey counterinsurgency efforts in Vietnam and draft an AID program in support of counterinsurgency, he was appointed Assistant Director for Rural Affairs/ Counterinsurgency, USOM/Saigon. BRIG. DAVID LEONARD POWELL-JONES, DSO, OBE, has had a distinguished and varied military career and has served in a number of theaters of war in the Middle and Far East. An officer in the Indian army, he was transferred in 1947, at the time of independence, to the Bri- gade of Gurkhas that was retained in the British service. During World War II he served in the Middle East from 1939 until 1941, participating in campaigns in the Western Desert, Eritrea, and Syria. He then returned to India, and from there was posted to Southeast Asia and Hong Kong. He acquired extensive experience of the problems and tactics of modern counterinsur- gency during the emergency in Malaya, where he had a prominent part in the British operations against the communist terrorists. He served as a battalion commander in Malaya from 1953 un- til 1956 and as commander of a brigade from 1957 to the end of 1958. The following year Brig. Powell-Jones attended the Imperial Defence College in London. His numerous appointments in intelligence and in planning have included a tour as member of the International Planning Team in the NATO Standing Group in Washington (1951-1953), and the post of Director of Plans both in the War Office (1960/1961) and in the Ministry of Defence (1961). Brig. Powell-Jones is now Deputy Commander and Chief of Staff on the British Army Staff and his country’s As- sistant Military Attaché in Washington, D.C. COL. JOHN R. SHIRLEY, OBE, has had wide experience in the area of counterguerrilla war- fare, primarily from the point of view of the operations-research specialist and expert in com- munications. His training at the Army Signal School in New Zealand, the Digla Signal School in Egypt, and the Catterick Signal School in England laid the foundations for his active career in the fields of electronics and military tactics. After World War II Col. Shirley’s assignments BIOGRAPHIES OF THE FORMAL PARTICIPANTS xxi xxii COUNTERINSURGENCY: A SYMPOSIUM included that of director of British army operations research in Western Europe, with respon- sibility for the scientific support of the Northern Army Group, a task oriented to the require- ments of a large-scale war. Thereafter, his efforts in the service of the British government were directed predominantly toward the demands of limited warfare, including problems of coun- terinsurgency. Thus Col. Shirley was asked to direct an operations-research team in Malaya in the mid-1950’s during a critical phase of the British campaign against the communist terrorists, with particular attention to the improvement of weapons and communications. Subsequently, he served as leader of a technical group that was sent to Kenya to investigate similar problems in the campaign against the Mau Mau rebellion. Since then Col. Shirley has joined Booz-Allen Ap- plied Research, Inc. in this country and has become a citizen of the United States. As Director of Research, and more recently as Vice President of that company, he has been responsible, among other things, for studies in the field of military operations research, development engineering, electronic warfare, and radio communications. COL. NAPOLEON D. VALERIANO, a graduate of the Philippine Military Academy and the U.S. Cavalry School, has had a distinguished career as an officer in the service of the United States and the Republic of the Philippines, in the course of which he became intimately involved in both guerrilla and counterguerrilla warfare. At the time of the Japanese invasion of the Philip- pines, he was serving on the headquarters staff of the 3lst Infantry Reserve Division during the Bataan campaign. After the surrender Col. Valeriano served with the anti-Japanese guerrilla forces on Luzon until General MacArthur’s return in 1945, when he joined the 1st Cavalry Division of the Sixth Army and participated in the Philippine liberation campaign. Among his numerous staff and command positions after the war was that of commander of the 7th Battal- ion Combat Team, which achieved spectacular results under his leadership in 1949/1950 against the communist Huk guerrillas on Luzon. Col. Valeriano subsequently served as military assis- tant to President Magsaysay; commander of the Presidential Guards Battalion; Secretary to the Philippine National Security Council; and national Security Co-ordinator for the Philippines. From 1954 to 1955 he was in South Vietnam on loan to the U.S. Military Mission. Thereafter, he became the Philippine Military Attaché in Thailand and his country’s military representative to the SEATO Secretariat. Col. Valeriano resigned his commission in 1957. He is coauthor, with Lt. Col. Charles T. R. Bohannan, of Counterguerrilla Operations: Lessons from the Philippines, published by Frederick A. Praeger, Inc., New York, 1962. COL. JOHN F. WHITE, OBE, AAR, gained his most valuable experience in counterinsurgent strategy and tactics during the emergency in Malaya. A graduate of the Royal Military College of Australia, he had previously served with the Australian Parachute Battalion (1941-1946) and had spent five years as instructor at the Royal Military College and the Australian Parachute School. He had been a company commander and brigade major during the Korean war (1951- 1952). In the latter part of 1957, following three years in Australia on various instructional and staff duties and a brief tour of duty in Singapore, he assumed command of the Third Battalion of the Royal Australian Regiment in Malaya, where for two years he successfully employed a large variety of counterinsurgent techniques against the communist terrorists. In I960 Col. White attended the U.S. Armed Forces Staff College. For the past two years he has been his country’s Military Attaché in the United States. LT. COL. SAMUEL V. WILSON has been concerned with aspects of insurgency and counter- insurgency throughout his distinguished military career. An officer in the U.S. Infantry (Spe- cial Forces qualified), he taught guerrilla and counterguerrilla tactics at the Infantry School at Fort Benning, Georgia, in 1942 and early 1943. He then joined the 5307th Composite Unit known as “Merrill’s Marauders,” with whom he participated in the North Burma campaign in 1943/1944. He was highly decorated for his part in this campaign, which essentially was one of guerrilla tactics and operations. After the war Col. Wilson was chosen to undergo training in the army’s four-year program for foreign area specialists. His general field of specialization was Russia, and his particular area of intensive research was the Soviet partisan movement of World War II. Between 1959 and 1961 he served at Fort Bragg as director of instruction in the U.S. Army Special Warfare School and as a member of the Seventh Special Group (Airborne). In June 1961 Col. Wilson was appointed to his present post as executive officer to the Assistant to the Secretary of Defense. BIOGRAPHIES OF THE FORMAL PARTICIPANTS xxiii APRIL 16,1962,A.M * CHARACTERISTICS AND PATTERNS OF GUERRILLA WARFARE Insurgency and Counterinsurgency s Tbey Differ from Ordinary Warfare: Their Main Objective, Control of tbe Population Tbe Political and Psycbological Side of Guerrilla Warfare, and tbe Importance of tbe Ideological Base A Tbe Crucial Function of the Trained Political Cadre The "Secure Base" of tbe Guerrilla as a Political Ratber Than a Pbysical Asset A Review and Analysis of Areas of Potential Insurgency Today MR HOSMER of The RAND Corporation, as host and chairman of the Symposium on Counterinsurgency, opened its first session by greeting those present on behalf of RAND He pointed out in the introductions that each member of the group had had extensive and successful experience in guerrilla Or counterguerrilla warfare, a5 had several other participants and guests who would join the Symposium for briefer periods in the course of the week: The aim of the meetings, as MR. HOSMER saW was to assemble some of the wealth of the participants' experience and knowledge of the subject; and to permit a free exchange of ideas and opinions, in the hope of identifying principles and techniques of guerrilla and counter- guerrilla warfare that would be useful to all those who today are concerned with that problem. The approach, therefore, was to be practical rather than academic Instead of formal papers there would be intensive round-table discussion, for which the Proposed Terms of Reference that had been distributed to the par- ticipants in advance of the meetings were to serve as & general guide rather than a rigid agenda MR. HOSMER then invited debate and comment, with the suggestion that the following opening questions from the Terms of Reference might serve as a useful of departure: What conditions cause guerrilla movements? What motivates Present: Col. Bohannan, Mr: Ellis, Col. Fertig, Col Galula, Mr: Greene, Mr. Hosmer, Gen Lansdale, Mr: Rutkowski, Mr: Tanham, Col. Valeriano, Col White, Col. Wilson it, point COUNTERINSURGENCY: A SYMPOSIUM the individual guerrilla? What are the major points of difference between com- munist guerrilla organizations and noncommunist insurgent movements? COL: GALULA began the discussion with some general comments on the unique purpose of the modern insurgent; which, in his opinion, determined the scope and of any attempt tO and to meet the problem: Guerrilla warfare, the most primitive form of armed conflict; has, in the last twenty years, been refined to the point where it is today an entirely new kind of warfare, for which the traditional textbooks offer no guidance, and about which we are having to learn from often painful experience: Revolutionary warfare requires a revo- lutionary approach on both sides in the struggle Whereas in ordinary war the objective is tO destroy the enemy and occupy his territory, the guerrilla'$ aim is to control the population This, therefore, must be the aim of the counter- guerrilla as well: Although the Symposium'$ main interest would appear to be centered on the military aspects of guerrilla warfare, it is well to realize (a) that we must concern ourselves at least equally with what precedes military activities (that what creates the guerrilla movement) and what will follow them; and (b) that the political aspects of guerrilla movements are highly important if not decisive: Asked to enlarge on these statements, COL GALULA continued: Those accus- tomed to planning in terms of conventional war often do not realize, for example, that it is difficult and sometimes futile to try to "identify prioricy targets for counterguerrilla operations' (a discussion suggested in the Terms of Refer- ence), because one of the principles of the insurgent is his willingness to abandon a base rather than fight for it in what might be an unsuccessful attempt Thus in 1947 Chinese Nationalist forces, in a large-scale operation, reached the capital of the Communists only to find it empty of all installations and military and administrative officials, an unthinkable situation in ordinary war: In 1953 in Indo- china the French came across a Vietminh study which concluded that no base or installation was worth defending Yet that very year the French m istakenly decided to attack Vietminh targets; they found nothing: There are, in COL. GALULA $ view, two patterns of revolutionary warfare {4 In the first; which might be called the 'orthodox" (communist) pattern, an exist- issue in the country is exploited by the revolutionary camp It may be political, economic, or even religious; it may be acute or dormant: (If it is dormant; the insurgents must make it acute ) Countries such as Peru, where wealth and political power are vested in a few while the masses are poOr and powerless, offer poten- tial issues of this kind So does every colonial territory, where the foreign ruler focus explore is, topic ing CHARACTERISTICS OF GUERRILLA WARFARE 3 holds most or all of the power: Conversely, the Greek Communists in the late 1940's failed precisely because they lacked such an issue, indeed any issue In addition to an exploitable problem, successful guerrilla action requires & weak government and an ineffective police force: (Therefore insurgency in the Iron Curtain countries, with their strongly established police forces, is unthinkable today:) In preparing the ground for a military offensive, the first and most difficult step for the revolutionaries is to create a strong party. (In Burma, for example, the Communists have not succeeded in establishing such a single elite party ) The second step is to spread the main issue to the masses in an effort tO create a broad popular front: After these two early steps, which involve no fighting and usually stay within legal bounds, the revolutionaries can move into actual military operations Selecting a fegion far femoved from the center of government and diffcult to control by legitimate forces, and one in which their party is already strong, will initiate guerrilla warfare, though at first only on a small scale and predom- inantly with small weapons To avoid the guerrillas' becoming what Mao Tse-tung calls 'coving bandits," they must obtain bases, either within or (as in South Viet-: nam today) outside the country s borders, and these bases also become the centers for the political organization through which the insurgents must control of the population and win its suppOrt Militarily, the next is t0 organize from the irregular guerrillas regular units of growing size (platoon, company, battalion, even division), the advanced guerrillas, until eventually the insurgent forces include regular troops, local units (which generally form the core of the local defenders of communist terri- tories),the guerrilla companies (which operate in enemy territory),and the militia With this setup, the Communists can strike as and where see opportunities for success, until have reached a point of equilibrium with the legitimate forces at which it is. safe to mount a major; decisive attack: If the governments side is weak, victory may come even without a last-ditch large-scale battle, possibly as @ fesult of a communist offer t0 negotiate: In the "unorthodox' pattern of guerrilla warfare, a group of impatient revo- lutionaries will omit the time-consuming of building a strong party. By 40 using 'blind terrorism that is t0 say, through random bombings and assassina- tions, will attract attention to themselves and win latent supporters t0 their cause: Then, by selective terrorism-a policeman here, a doctor there; or a man who refuses to contribute money to the cause ~= are able t0 isolate the counter- they gain step they they phase they they COUNTERINSURGENCY: A SYMPOSIUM insurgents from the rest of the population and terrorize the people into silence: (Algeria is an example of these tactics) Once the "battle of silence" is Won, the guerrilla can operate freely, and from here on the unorthodox pattern follows much the same lines as the orthodox As in the latter, the creation of the insur- gents' party is the crucial task, and the support of the population is recognized as essential. One basic difference between insurgency and counterinsurgency, in COL. GALULA' s definition, is that the insurgent starts out with nothing but & cause and grows to strength, while the counterinsurgent often starts with everything but a cause and gradually declines in strength to the of weakness: Planners of counterinsurgent strategy must not lose sight of that crucial difference: must understand, moreover, that regular army operations have rarely been suc- cessful (except perhaps in the somewhat special case of Malaya, and then only after the British had resettled the population in guarded camps) And they should be aware, tOo, that aid programs and various other attempts to raise the people's standard of living have never yet yielded the desired results The counterinsur- gents, on the other hand, must realize and exploit the inherent weakness of guerrilla warfare: the fact that neither the people nor the insurgents' political organization within the population can move The characteristic pattern of counterinsurgent warfare, aS COL. GALULA sees it; begins with an operation designed only to destroy, Of expel from a chosen area, the insurgents' main armed forces Once this has been achieved_by purely mili- tary means the counterinsurgent can, and must; work o the population with a view to gaining control over it: He does so by destroying the insurgents' political organization, and by finding among the people capable and trustworthy new lead- ers who then are given full powers and support: Thereafter, the active help of the population is enlisted in the effort to out the remnants of the guerrillas_ now too few to be caught in large-scale operations And, finally, the counter- insurgent side must organize a party of its own to prevent the guerrillas' return: Once the process is completed in one area, and sometimes even before, it is repeated in another, usually an adjoining area COL FERTIG qualified COL GALULA $ opening statement by pointing out that the guerrilla warfare of the past twenty years was not in itself new; only its methods had been perfected. If the defenders have sometimes not met it effec- tively, the reason has been not sO much weakness or inefficiency of government as simple failure to recognize the problem they faced. Thus, in the Philippines the Huk guerrilla movement was allowed to develop without the legitimate point They wipe CHARACTERISTICS OF GUERRILLA WARFARE 5 government's taking any real action, out of a "do-gooders mistaken policy of leaving decisions and initiative to the local population wherever possible MR GREENE mentioned cases such as Malaya, the Philippines, and Vietnam_ where revolutionary wars had started in times of military and political upheaval, and the insurgents gained a head start by taking advantage of a vacuum in leader- ship Or of recent military experience and the availability of arms (COL BOHANNAN cited Colombia, Cuba, China, and the Boer War, on the other hand; as instances where this had not been true.) COL. FERTIG added that the Communists have frequently usurped the leadership of a nationalist movement; taking advantage of existing disorganization and people's readiness to fight; and initially hiding behind the nationalist cause. As to what motivates the individual guerrilla, COL. FERTIG pointed to his experience of the Philippines, where joining a cadre of the guerrillas* was often the only alternative to dying by torture: The initial bands of guerrillas - many of them desperados and virtual bandits with nothing to lose produced a few men of leadership caliber, out of whom the movement grew, while the rest were absorbed or eliminated. COL. GALULA cited, as an example of the effectiveness of appealing to men of lower class origin, the efforts of the Communist Party in France to recruit cadres among the roughly 14,000 African students. each Inevitably, the most susceptible of these students were the least significant among them, men with little to lose and much to by the communist promise to raise them from obscurity. COL. BOHANNAN objected that the generalization failed to take account of the significant minority of genuine believers - be it in communist doctrine Or in another ideal from whom came the outstanding leaders of insurgent move- ments. Many of the best Filipinos, for example, who might have lived peacefully under the Japanese, voluntarily incurred the dangers of joining the guerrillas because fervently believed in the cause of freedom: Although, as COL FERTIG pointed out; these dedicated men were more Often found on the civilian side, there were educated, motivated activists also in the guerrilla companies; rowdies alone did not make for a successful guerrilla campaign: GEN. LANSDALE fully supported this view; there has to be a motive, he said, around which to create the political basis that is essential for a viable guerrilla movement. COL. GALULA granted that there were four major possible motivations for the guerrilla: belief in the ideals of the movement, personal ambition, fear (for oneself or one's family), and the desire to join the bandwagon after initial suC- #COL. FERTIG and his troops represented the insurgent side against rhe Japanese occupation of the Islands year: gain they COUNTERINSURGENCY : A SY MPOSIU M cesses: COL FERTIG confirmed the importance especially of the first of these on the basis of his observations in the Philippines, where he attributed much of the guerrilla movement' $ eventual success to people's willingness to fight for the liberty and democratic government of which had had earlier experience MR HOSMER cited 3 study based on interviews of captured Malayan terrorists (most of them in the communist movement for some time), which had pointed up the importance of the individual's stake in the movement. And, as an illus- tration of the varieties of motivation, COL. WHITE summarized the situation in Malaya, where during the war the population had gone all out to fight theJapanese After the war some leaders of the erstwhile anti-Japanese forces headed the com- munist forces, now out to get rid of the British; were dedicated men, but were quickly joined by many who found it more attractive to terrorize for than t0 work for a living MR RUTKOWSKI raised the problem of how t0 identify the of transition at which control of the movement passes from the low-level, self-interested bandit to the eventual communist leader: How does the latter manage to replace the original strong-arm man? In answer to the second question, COL. FERTIG stressed the advantage of the leader who is able to offer the potential recruit to the guerrilla side more than protection of one bully against another: In the Philippines control was achieved more easily as men like himself could identify themselves with an outside power that promised to help the country, and could to American successes in Australia and to General MacArthurs pledge tO return. COL. GALULA cited the historical example of China in 1947 where, despite the tradition of banditty, the Communists succeeded because of superior organization combined with dedication. COL. WHITE and COL BOHANNAN both felt that the banditry aspect was being stressed unduly, with China almost the only case in which it had been a major factor in a guerrilla movement In the Philippines, Malaya, and other insurgent theaters, the appeal has been primarily to the interests of the people In the special case of Colombia, banditry, without ideological base, has survived the guerrilla movement itself; of which the Communists, who did much to pIO- voke it, never gained control. GEN. LANSDALE stated that, inasmuch as the hard-core Communists will work for years (even; as in Vietnam, for decades) preparing the ground for a take-over, and will resort to military means only if they can't succeed by political means (Indochina and the Philippines being cases in point), it is essential that we identify they they gain point point CHARACTERISTICS OF GUERRILLA WARFARE the areas in which such cadres are at work or in the making to be able to stop them in time To d0 so is all the more important, COL GALULA added, as the counter- insurgent suffers a serious disadvantage vis-a-vis the insurgent if the latter is allowed to develop unnoticed or unchecked. Once the insurgent side has lished some degree of control, there is no longer room for a rival clandestine organization: As a prerequisite for any attempt at identification such as GEN. LANSDALE suggested, COL. WILSON emphasized the distinction thus far inadequately stressed in our service schools - S between two entirely different situations in which the Communists initiate guerrilla war: In the first they will seize on existing resent- ment (people's hatred of an oppressOr, O1 their desire to recover lost privileges or property) and capture an independent movement already under way: The second is the culmination of years of communist planning and organization, as in the case of Central Vietnam, which was just described by GEN. LANSDALE, and of many other countries. COL. GALULA then reviewed, country by country, the areas of potential unfest today, in an effort to identify nations with latent issues that threatened most seriously to become acute, making these countries plausible sites and vulnerable targets of communist insurgency. Among Asian countries, COL GALULA thought; the Philippines would seem [O present no great problem. Indonesia, with an active Communist Party, has one major issue, economic chaos, and thus may be considered ripe for guerrilla initia- tive. (The absence of such action thus far might be explained by Moscow and Pekings pressure against it *) Cambodia, lacking any majof ethnic or religious conflict; offers no grave threat: Burma, on the other hand, with its strong facial and religious issues, furnishes certain possibilities for communist exploitation and future trouble: In India the central problem, poverty, is an obvious basis for communist propaganda work. Pakistan, with its perennial conflict between East and West Pakistan and the inequitable distribution of population and revenue berween the two, offers a similar opportunity. Ceylon, with the conflicts inherent in its having several races and languages, bears watching The main problem in many countries of the Near East; as COL GALULA sees it, is the concentration of wealth and political power in a few hands and the extreme poverty of the masses This is certainly true of Iran. In Saudi Arabia the problem is 'GEN.

FERTIG, in reply, described as an ideal site for guerrilla operations an island with poor communications, easy access t0 the sea,and a mountainous interior (with year-round rains) that could grow enough food for both the insurgents and the people. He cited the advantages that his own guerrilla troops on Mindanao had enjoyed, for these very reasons, over those on Luzon: The wide plains of Luzon, easily covered by Japanese tanks, offered no hiding places to the guerrillas, who were pushed back into almost uninhabited and inhospitable mountains, where they quickly starved COL. BOHANNAN pointed out that the Communists in the postwar period were able to give the Philippine government & deal of trouble on Luzon, even though were in wide-open plains, with excellent communications and roads for the army, and did not have COL. FERTIG' $ terrain advantage and strong base organization This, he thought; was due to their strong political base and heavily armed force: COL. GALULA confirmed that, once the insurgents had estab- lished a strong foothold and organization, terrain ceased tO be the overriding factor; population density, he thought, then became decisive: {6 In a lengthy discussion of what constituted a secure' base, the partici- pants agreed that a secure base was a political, rather than a physical, one. In MR. TANHAM'$ definition, the secure (political) base is one where you have either won over or neutralized the people of the area to the where refuse to CO-operate with the enemy even after you leave; thus you may have a secure base even in an area that the enemy occupies sporadically. COL. FERTIG commented that he himself, in the Philippines, had never had a secure base by the above definition; every one of his headquarters was sooner or later occupied by the Japanese. And he quoted from a captured document in which the Japanese prob- good they they point CHARACTERISTICS OF GUERRILLA WARFARE General Moramoto admitted having had control only of the places physically occupied by the Japanese In answer tO a question from COL GALULA about the intelligence of both sides in the Philippines, COL. FERTIG explained that, whereas his own guerrilla forces had complete information on the Japanese, the Japanese were partially and sometimes inaccurately informed about his movements and positions They were often unable to sift the truth from among planted stories and from those con- cocted by would-be agents overly eager to supply information for which the Japanese were paying As a general rule, COL. FERTIG believed that the guerrilla, if he is to survive, must have better intelligence than his enemy an advantage, COL, GALULA added, that he can achieve only if he has the support of the people At the beginning of hostilities, the population typically is divided into three distinct groups: a small body of people already willing to support the guerrilla, a large neutral group, and a small segment that is actively hostile to the insurgents It is the task of the guerrilla leader to identify the small group already friendly to his cause and to use it to control the majority and neutralize the hostile minority: Here, COL. BOHANNAN pointed out the importance of distinguishing between indigenous communist insurgency (to which COL. GALULA'$ rule undoubtedly applied) and the type of guerrilla movement that is based on an enemy invasion and occupation. In the latter case, the guerrilla will begin by having the sincere good wishes of the vast majority of the population, and the hostile and apathetic will represent only a very small group. In COL. WILSON' $ opinion, this was the main difference, not yet well enough understood, between the guerrillas of World War II and the present communist-organized instances of guerrilla war- fare: Today in Vietnam, for example, both sides are vying for the 75 to 80 per cent of the population who are politically apathetic The discussion returned briefly to the continent-by-continent review of coun- tries that were more Or less ripe for communist insurgency: According to COL FERTIG, much of South America and most of Central America has all the elements that generate such movements: a large and extremely poor lower class, a small and very wealthy upper class, and virtually no middle class Chile is an example of these conditions, but its length militates against effective simultaneous organi- zation of both north and south, and the northern desert terrain is unsuitable for guerrilla operations, for the government could forestall O1 defeat any insurgent attempt merely by controlling the water holes there. GEN. LANSDALE quoted MR PHILLIPS' view that Ecuador and Bolivia were the chief danger areas in South only 10 COUNTERINSURGENCY : 4 SYMPOSIUM America. COL. VALERIANO thought that any Latin American country on the Pacific side was a ripe candidate for an outbreak of guerrilla warfare today- Colombia has had much guidance from Chinese experts, suggesting the possibility that; as soon as the situation in the Caribbean is sufficiently stabilized, the Chinese Communists may be planning to foster communist insurgency in the countries immediately west and southwest of that area Recent developments in Guatemala, Bolivia, and Ecuador lend weight to this theory, and, in general, the Chinese Communists appear to be expanding their influence on the Pacific side of Latin America Aside from the economic and social imbalances favoring them, there is another possible motive: the psychological effect to be gained by any successful challenge of the principle of Pan-Americanism Apropos of the often-expressed fear that Castro may export his revolution to other Latin American countries, MR HOSMER raised the question of the function and importance of foreign experts and advisors both in preparing the ground politically and in training the future guerrillas militarily. Can this be accomplished with a relatively small cOrps of specialists? The Communists, COL GALULA maintained, object t0 this in principle and would have the natives do the work; even if it takes time, rather than inject Russian or Chinese advisors directly: COL. VALERIANO pointed out; however; that rebellions can be, and often are, pre- pared by an outside power, which will train and indoctrinate indigenous groups of individuals abroad and then send such skilled cadres back in t0 lead the insur- gent movement: A classic example is the case of Fidel Castro, who, after an abortive attempt to seize power, fled [O Mexico, underwent intensive training under the well-known communist guerrilla trainer Colonel and returned to Cuba with a cadre that included Raul Castro and Che Guevara: As one of several instances where outside leadership had been evident at the site of the rebellion, especially in the formative and early phases of a guerrilla war, MR GREENE mentioned American and Indonesian communist agents in the Philippines who helped with the political organization. COL. BOHANNAN added that this help extended also to training of the field army, but he stressed the incon- spicuous advisory, rather than leading, function of these foreign nationals In Malaya, on the other hand, said COL WHITE, where 92 per cent of the guerrillas were Chinese, there was no supply Or help, and little influence, from without; and MR TANHAM pointed out that the Vietminh, tOO, had only minimal outside assistance until the Chinese reached the border: apart from any question of direct leadership and physical aid, COL: GALULA Said, the doctrinal influence of Communist China was very apparent in Bayo, Yet, CHARACTERISTICS OF GUERRILLA WARFARE 11 Indochina It manifested itself; for instance, in 1949 in the Vietminh's radical change of attitude toward their prisoners from the previous rough treatment to the Chinese principle of decent treatment and suasion with a view tO political conversion (As a prisoner of the Communists in China in 1947, COL, GALULA had been treated, quite typically, almost like a guest of honor ) The Chinese Communists generally gave their prisoners a choice among several alternatives: (a) joining the communist army, (b) settling as civilians in communist territory, (c) being demobilized, and even (d) going back to the national army (which meant that their captors would not have to feed them) Once, interviewing & group of 250 junior officers in a prison camp, COL GALULA met three who had been oners before, and had returned to the Nationalists and been recaptured. The conciliatory. approach was sO effective that during the war the Communists had Nationalists their prisoners (COL. FERTIG recalled a similar phenomenon in the Philippines, where a Japanese general in 1944 launched a conciliation program that proved SO effective as t0 constitute a real threat to the guerrillas ) COL GALULA contrasted the Chinese principle with the less sophisticated methods of the FLN in Algeria, who treated their prisoners brutally and often killed them pris- guard APRIL 16,1962,P.M:* PRIMARY OBJECTIVES OF COUNTERINSURGENCY AND SOME EFFECTIVE ORGANIZATIONAL AND OPERATIONAL APPROACHES Tbe Indispensable Need for Popular Support How Imbortant a Target Is tbe Indi- vidual Enemy Leader?

White. 12 path they PRIMARY OBJECTIVES OF COUNTERINSURGENCY 13 certainly a most important immediate objective. COL. GALULA added that, wherever you have gained control and won the support of the population, and have thereby defeated the guerrilla locally, You can afford to release your forces, for the guerrilla cannot easily come back In COL. BOHANNAN's view, people will revert [O their normal political indifference once the leaders of the guerrilla have been eliminated. COL. FERTIG agreed: Nowhere, he said, is leadership more important than in guerrilla warfare, where there is often strong attachment to the individual who symbolizes the cause; by eliminating him you have accomplished much of your task. COL. GALULA had found this not to be entirely true in Algeria, where, as soon as leaders were caught; new ones emerged to take their place As a rule, the second run was distinctly inferior to the first, and the third was somewhat better (because the guerrilla had realized the importance of good leadership through this recent experience) In the end the high rate of attrition among insurgent leaders inevitably led to a significant decline in their quality: Yet the rebellion continued, because the rebels in the field were too strongly committed to it; and, though COL. FERTIG was right in saying that the elimination of one guerrilla leader was more effective than that of ten t0 twenty ordinary fighters, it was rarely decisive The exceptionally capable leader, according to COL BOHANNAN, is perhaps even more important to the counterguerrilla than to the guerrilla movement: The troops personal attachment may be less of a factor there, and any one leader is therefore not indispensable, but the qualities ofaggressive leadership, imagination, and fexibility are crucial The ability to shift and improvise in accordance with changing requirements is needed most, and at the same time most difficult to exert; where you are operating within an established administrative structure that has established procedures In the Philippines it took & Magsaysay (or any one of at least a half-dozen other men with the same drive,imagination,and rapport with the people who might have done the job) to cut through the multiplicity of vested func- tions and privileges and launch an effective movement One of the most difficult problems is placing a man with such ifications in an official position where he can use them: COL. WHITE pointed out that in Malaya the British leaders who succeeded one another had all been men of stature and unusual ability, and that; in fact,; the coun- terinsurgents in most instances were more fortunate than the insurgents in having a larger reservoir from which to recruit able leaders COL. GALULA granted this last point; but added that this advantage was offset by the disadvantage of a rela- tively slow rate of natural selection, as compared to the guerrillas whose use Of again qualz 14 COUNTERINSURGENCY: A SY MPOSIUM nonbureaucratic criteria and methods (the most effective of which is physical elimination) makes for & very fast process COL. WHITE $ statement in principle, it was wise to kill the enemy leader; wherever possible,met with general agreement: Yet COL_ FERTIG cautioned against the unforeseeable possibility that; in SO doing, you might propel into prominence a better leader; he cited the case of Col. Volckmann (who has since retired with the rank of brigadier general) in Northern Luzon: though a third-generation leader;, he was more effective than his tWo predecessors, who had trained him and from whose errors (both men were betrayed) he had learned. The first to fight on the basis of guerrilla tactics, he streamlined his organization and eliminated every potential traitor: COL GALULA pointed out that the Communists themselves have strong doc- trinal objections to overemphasizing the importance of the individual leader; hence, rotate leaders, groom successors, and try to prevent the cult of person- ality. MR GREENE substantiated this with a quotation from Che Guevara to the effect that Fidel Castro had not been essential to the success of the movement in Cuba- Lat a statement that COL GALULA thought quite consistent with the classic tenet that communism is a mass movement helped, but not made, by leaders COL VALERIANO thought that; once you killed an enemy leader, much depended on how fast and well you exploited the confusion caused in his camp by his sudden loss_ Also, low-level leaders are more lucrative targets than upper-level leaders. In the Philippines, for example, if you killed a squadron leader, it would take a year to a year-and-a-half for the squadron to be reconscructed, and it would never be as effective as before. (Once the squadron that took part in the ambush and killing of Mrs Quezon had been identified, there was & seven-month successful campaign to rout out all its commanders, and the 700-man squadron was never re-formed.) COL WHITE $ experience in Malaya, on the contrary, had been that even low-level leaders were quickly replaced (as in the Case of an ambushed leader whose wife took his within a week) COL. VALERLANO Said that his side in the Philippines had actually operated on the principle, earlier by COL WHITE himself, that leaders at all levels must be eliminated. The higher ones, though their death does not necessarily cause the collapse of the rebellion, mean a greater loss of prestige for the move ment Hence, generally speaking, the counterguerrilla leader will do best to aim for the elimination of his counterpart in the field, and clever exploitation of the shock effects of loss can bring large rewards In Central Luzon the shock periods varied from one-and-a-half months (for example, in the Huk Regional Command 3) that, they point again place stated PRIMARY OBJECTIVES OF COUNTERINSURGENCY 15 to two weeks (as under the more aggressive commander of Regional Command 2), before a squadron would show up in battle under new leadership. In answer to MR: GREENE' $ question about the immediate effect of the sur- render of Taruc on the Huk movement; COL. BOHANNAN thought Taruc $ was not a good case in point The movement was virtually doomed by that time, and the effect of the surrender of its spiritual leader Was merely to symbolize this fact to his followers A dedicated man, activist as well as spiritual leader; Taruc saw sur- render as the only way to avoid useless fighting, and he did not have open to him the exits that permitted Greek communist leaders to flee to adjoining countries in a similar situation in 1950. Upon MR: HOSMER' $ question as to other primary. objectives in counter- guerrilla warfare, COL GALULA, drawing on his Algerian experience, gave this expose of an approach that he believed applicable to many insurgency situations By the time the armed forces of the government are called part of the country will have been contaminated by the guerrillas, and incoming troops will find the population in some areas already organized, terrorized, afraid of spies, unwilling t0 talk, and yielding little Or no information on guerrilla organization and troops The first step for the counterinsurgents, therefore, is to choose, within the contaminated territory, a smaller area in which to concentrate their efforts As commander of the counterinsurgent side, you must take into account not only the obvious (military and topographic) factors that would be considered in a conven- tional waf in choosing the most suitable area for an attack, but also certain aspects of the situation that relate to the populace. Among these are the density of the population and the degree to which the guerrilla has already organized the people. (The more sparsely populated and the less well organized the area, the easier the problem:) Once you have decided on the area to be purged, you can proceed to destroy the enemy, or at least expel him from that sector, by the relatively simple method of mounting a series of one-day attacks that might be called "cylinder-and- piston operations (The cylinder in this case is a cordon of fixed troops around three sides of the infested area; the piston is a concentrated force moved in from the fourth side to compel the enemy to retreat Or scatter toward the fixed troops ) The main purpose in this first step is not necessarily to destroy the rebels but to set up in the area small posts that are safe from rebel counteraction: If, after a week or a month of such an effort; YOu can establish forces of battalion, company, and finally platoon level, you have accomplished your aim. With a number of posts and sizable troop units 0n your side and the rebels in again in, 16 COUNTERINSURGENCY: A SYMPOSIUM the area reduced to small, scattered elements and men in hiding, you can go 0n to the next step: establishing the degree of control that will prevent the rebels from coming back The ideal would be t0 seal the area, as was done for the whole of Algeria, where it became impossible after 1957 to smuggle in more than four people at a time across the eastern and western borders But this extremely costly mechanical procedure may not be feasible in most situations Having completed the first step, and having chosen an area Of control that is not SO small as to permit outside rebel forces to penetrate it within 2 night's march nor SO large as to cause your forces to be too thinly distributed, you can afford to retire some of your forces, keeping only a reserve strong enough to handle 44 enemy incursions To this end, you compartmentalize' the area, with a post in each compartment (say, at company level), and a local commander in control. (See Fig: 1.) Most important, the over-all direction of the process has to be with a territorial commander, familiar with the area and in touch with its people, who must remain the undisputed chief even if high-ranking troop commanders are brought in. In choosing the location for the posts you do well to pick the cally and administratively most important villages rather than positions that are strategic only from a military point of view Compartmentalization of 0 purged sector Contaminated Uncontominated area orea FIG. 1 t Compartmentalizing Area of Control in Postmilitary Phase Here, COL. VALERIANO interrupted COL. GALULA to ask (a) how, in these clearing operations, one distinguished the genuinely peaceful farmer from the seemingly peaceful one who was a part-time armed guerrilla at night; and b) what could be done about the regular guerrillas who remained imbedded in the population COL. GALULA answered that the typical population in insurgent territory consists of (4) the regular guerrillas; (b) the part-time guerrillas (described by COL. VALERIANO); (c) political supporters of the revolutionaries; and (d) the fest politi- PRIMARY OBJECTIVES OF COUNTERINSURGENCY 17 of the people, with many shades of feelings In the first phase of counterinsurgency just outlined; you need to concern yourself only with the first of these, because once the 'regular' forces of the enemy are expelled Or immobilized, the part- time guerrilla cannot easily operate Regular guerrillas who hide in the population will come out sooner Or later, Or else will just split up and stop all their armed activity. In the first instance, YOu will catch them; in the second, they cease to be a problem for the time being, and their final elimination can be entrusted to a con- certed effort of the entire population at some later time In feply to COL. BOHANNAN' s question as to how many trOOps are required for an operation such as the one described, COL. GALULA thought that this would depend largely on the terrain, and you could not therefore give universally cable facts and fgures To take a specific case, in the Kabylie area east of Algiers, which is about 100 miles long and 60 miles wide, with precipitous mountains that the soldiers and vehicles to make detours to cover relatively short distances, and with 2 population density equal to that of Belgium, surprise was impossible, for troops had to come from afar and by the highways, and it took twelve battalions to comb an area of 18 square miles Having secured an area militarily, COL. GALULA continued, you must work on the population and, first of all, destroy the rebels' political organization. For this you need intelligence, which you can only if the people are convinced that are not only strong but are going tO stay, S0 that need not fear reprisal from the guerrillas for having helped you: Wait until you discover three Or four people in each village whom You suspect of working with the insurgents Artest them all at the same time, not one by one, for will find a certain safety in numbers (if a secret is betrayed; it might have been any one of them) Then inter- rogate: them, and probably will lead you to the insurgents' political cell COL. GALULA singled out three important points in embarking on the destruction of a village insurgent organization: (1) This is essentially police work and, ideally, therefore should not be done by the army: If for lack of police the army has to undertake it; special intelligence groups should be organized for the task, s0 as to dissociate the acmy as such from the unpleasant side of police activities: (2) It is useless to purge a village unless you ate ready to establish a post in it Otherwise, the rebels will rebuild a cell from the outside, and you will have to repeat the entire process later, against much greater popular reluctance: (3) To control a village, which includes surveillance of all traffic in and out, you must institute a system of passes and permits, based on a complete census that establishes who the legitimate inhabitants are and who does not belong The house-by-house census, they appli- long require get they you they they 18 COUNTERINSURGENCY: A SYMPOSIUM your first individual contact with the people, is also your opening for psychological operations Having purged the village and ascertained from local informers not only who was for the guerrillas but also who was against them and may therefore be material for antirebel cadres, you must ask the people t0 elect new leaders. Once elected, these men must be tested for their reliability through a variety of civic tasks, and the one who proves himself must be given all possible power and aid Finally, You must help the population set up its own defense units (either paid, full-time professional forces Or a militia of local farmers), and make the people select military leaders from their own ranks After that; the remaining small rebel elements usually surrender and disappear, and you can then bring down your strength to two or three men whom you leave behind, while the bulk of your forces is freed to repeat the process in another, usually an adjoining, area This method, at first used only experimentally by individual commanders, later became standard procedure in Algeria Asked specifically how much time it might require to clean up & typical area, COL. GALULA gave this account of the first problem he encountered on arriving in Algeria and of his success and rate of progress in the operation: In July of 1956 the company he then commanded was assigned an area in Kabylie: The company sectof (O1 sO#s-quartier) was part of a battalion area (Or quartier) 10 miles long and 6 miles wide, with mountains ranging up to 3000 feet; which contained seven main villages and five Or six hamlets and had a total of twelve to fifteen thousand inhabitants: By October COL. GALULA had cleaned the first village in his sous- quartier , having been lucky enough to be given a list of all FLN political agents, which led to a great deal of intelligence information: By December (the sozs- quartier having by then been enlarged) he had purged and occupied three more villages * By February 1957 this entire sous-quartier had been cleaned up. Periodi- cally, as the battalion quartier was expanded, so was the sous-quartier, and in the end COL. GALULA had complete and effective control over an area comprising half the original battalion quartier plus considerable territory in the lowland to the south of it; with a total population of about fifteen thousand. In another and much larger area, COL. GALULA added, where, after their initial successful operations of 1956, the French units busied themselves mainly with military tasks and left the population to itself, the insurgents not only survived #In answer [0 question from COL_ VALERIANO: A typical distance between villages in Algeria would be about three- quarters of a mile, but road passage might require a 3-mile march, and men on foot were hard [0 spOt because of the terrain cover_ PRIMARY OBJECTIVES OF COUNTERINSURGENCY 19 but thrived: Having learned a valuable lesson in the early months of the war; organized their forces into small groups of never more than twenty men (the stand- ard number being between five and ten), and it took months of intensive, large- scale operations in 1959 to achieve anything significant against them: COL VALERIANO mentioned similar operations conducted by the Japanese in the Philippines In one of these, after learning where a few Americans were hiding, they saturated the area with an entire division and stayed forty-five in the very village where the Americans were, employing the most brutal terror methods But when they left; the Americans were still there, having found it safer to stay hidden than t0 move out. COL. VALERIANO himself had marched in with weapons and radio receivers on the eleventh of the Japanese operation. Despite their massive effort; the Japanese obtained very Iittle information from the local people: Terror and torture succeeded in producing the opposite of their intended effecc Even informers were often executed, and rather than tell on the Americans, the Filipinos hid them in their cellars, and the women fed them. As soon as the Japanese moved out; leaving only a normal garrison behind, the other side quickly regained con- trol, and the Americans came Out: COL GALULA saw in this incident an illustration of a fundamental error of the Japanese: that of antagonizing the population by an abuse of terror: The ultimately more successful method, which required greater patience, was to the guerrilla moving, trap him sooner or later, and gradually persuade a population that has not been so antagonized to give you the needed information and to refuse to hide the guerrillas. Without this kind of co-operation, the insurgent or counterinsurgent cannot sustain a military advantage: During the civil war in Greece, for example, the Communists staged commando-type operations rather than typical guerrilla action. The terrain made it easy enough fof them to infiltrate and operate behind the Greek lines, but they failed to establish a hold because lacked the support of the population and therefore were denounced and caught when spotted by citizens COL VALERIANO' s account also illustrated to COL GALULA, however, the serious danger of the guerrilla's staying imbedded in the population If you cannot prevent this from happening, you have tO force the guerrilla to hide so deeply that he cannot attack in numbers and will eventually be forced out when you have control of the population Asked by COL. FERTIG what success the French had in excluding the guerrillas from the inner ring of the perimeter in Indochina, COL. GALULA said that they suc- ceeded until 1952. After that the Vietminh were too highly organized, with they days day keep long they again fegular 20 COUNTERINSURGENCY: A SYMPOSIUM tfoops as well as guerrillas operating within and outside the perimeter, and the French could no longer cope with them. To COL. BOHANNAN this French experience in Indochina demonstrated the fundamental danger of concentrating too many of your troops on keeping a small area clean, thereby leaving too large an area in which the guerrilla can operate undisturbed COL. GALULA pointed out that the counterinsurgents paramount stra- tegic objective must be to use his initial superiority of numbers and materiel in such a way as to prevent the guerrilla from moving from one phase of revolutionary warfare t0 the next; in selecting the area or areas of main effort; therefore; he must consider many factors. In Algeria the strategy until 1958,ifany, was mainly to theborder waterproof and to maintain Order in the cities After 1958,with the same forces,a more coherent effort was directed at certain areas, starting with the western (Moroccan) border, going on to the eastern border, from there to Algiers, etc. In answer tO a question from MR: HOSMER, BRIG. POWELL-JONES on objectives in Malaya Here, too, the British had to establish priorities,as they were not strong enough to be effective everywhere at once. The Briggs Plan, later devel- further by General Templer; was to set targets for various parts of the country, clearing them one at a time and thus making them into what were called "white" 44 areas: Keeping the whole territory 'waterproof" (an easier task in Malaya than in Algeria) was most important: Within the area so sealed off, priorities for concen- trated effort were determined in various ways- ~ some because of their political importance (big towns, seats of government; Or those nearest to Singapore), others because were relatively easy to clean up. The main settled areas were the west coast; and within the various districts the progression in general was from the coast inland and from the administrative centers outward, with the last terrorist strongholds inland from the east coast (a pattern, COL GALULA commented, that resembled the one ultimately used against the Communists in Greece) BRIG. POWELL-JONES stressed also the psychological advantage of manageable small-scale operations The as yet uncommitted civilian population sees that you can accomplish what You set out to and in a reasonbly short time; your own soldiers derive satisfaction from such a tangible success; and the terrorists, on being told that you will clean up a given area in a given number of months, are faced with the alternatives of letting you do it (finel) o trying to stop you (thereby helping you achieve your aim ofbringing the enemy to battle) COL GALULA mentioned the added advantage of gaining the needed experience in small areas rather than spread- inevitable mistakes over large ones. Moreover, the local operation permits you t0 spot local leaders for later positions of responsibility: keep spoke oped along they do, ing PRIMARY OBJECTIVES OF COUNTERINSURGENCY 21 MR HOSMER then raised the question of how and at what one mobilizes the other elements in the society to aid in the general counterguerrilla effort COL GALULA thought that; where the guerrilla already has the support of the peo- ple, you cannot hope for support until you have putged the area of rebels and created a new political organization: COL. BOHANNAN looked on this as a 'self- defeating of view because even an area under guerrilla control has in it a few people who will not co-operate: The cylinder-and-piston method described by COL GALULA is a good one if,as in Algeria, you have the necessary troops With fewer men you may have to entrench a counterguerrilla troop near a village, let the men gradually make contact with the villagers during the (even if the guef- rilla comes back at night),and the guerrillaon the move by constant patrolling Although COL GALULAs Algerian experience did not bear out COL BOHAN- NANs theory, both men agreed on the importance of patrolling and, above all, on the fact that the population is the to the problem: COL. BOHANNAN empha- sized again, however, that the operations outlined by COL GALULA called for an enormous troop-to-guerrilla ratio (not likely to obtain in & country with an indig enous guerrilla force), and also, he pointed 0ut; for the suspension of civil liberties to an undesirable degree: COL: GALULA thought that the troop-to-guerrilla ratio might not be quite s0 great a problem a5 COL BOHANNAN assumed, but admitted that the question of civil liberties was a serious one fof the defenders of democracy. The French in Algeria had been very much aware of this, and had gone to extraordinary lengths IO maintain the appearance of lawful processes Until 1958, for example, every unit had a team of gendarmes attached to it; whose function was to follow the men into action and, after the shooting, count the dead and make a report of man- slaughter' against the commanding officers. In a legal farce the case would go to court; there to be dismissed. Also, there was at least a theoretical rule that; when you met an armed enemy, you had to warn him three times (!) before firing at him: These experiences demonstrated the need to peacetime legislation for the protection of civil liberties to the special conditions of insurgency: BRIG. POWELL-JONES agreed that the problem was difficult; but he insisted on the importance of maintaining a modicum of legality and order, of conducting searches as decently as possible, etc;, so that the people can think of you as essen- tially In Malaya every effort was made, as in Algeria, to preserve at least a semblance of due legal and humane procedure, despite the unfortunate incidents that inevitably occurred now and then: COL. GALULA concluded that firm and unequivocal rules, a scale of punish- point point day keep key adapt 'good:' 22 COUNTERINSURGENCY: A SYMPOSIUM ments to fit the crimes, and the will to enforce these penalties were essential if one hoped to achieve perfect control The fact that not every commander in Algeria understood and on this principle accounted, he thought; for the variations in the success of pacification from one command to another. In order to overcome the duality of military and civilian authority that at times made it difficult for the military commander to the above principle, COL. GALULA explained (in answer to a question from COL VALERIANO) that certain 6( sectors in Algeria had to be declared 'military' areas; in the nonmilitary areas, the local general succeeded only where he was on terms with the local prefect: This was very different, BRIG. POWELL-JONES pointed out; from the situation in Malaya, where the military could never take over from the civilians Even in the very worst areas control was vested in a committee (under the chairmanship of the civil authority), which at the Civil District level included the District Officer; the police, local civilians (European planters and representative Chineseand Malayans) , and, last of all, the soldiers In declared "black" areas, where the troops had the right to shoot at sight, that right had to be expressly granted, and could be with- drawn;by the appropriate committee. Any breakdown ofcivilauthority,or instances when the military took the law in its own hands, BRIG. POWELL-JONES considered a victory for the other side The function of the military, he emphasized, was to back up the civil authority,and the number and distribution oftroops was entirely a matter of priority of targets. The severity with which the civilian population had to be controlled and restricted depended on how desperate or favorable was the military situation, a fact that served as a strong incentive to the people to help the legitimate forces, whose success meant less local terrorism and greater freedom for the civilians. Food was still anorher means of pressure; the principle was to allow the indi- vidual just enough so that he could say to the guerrilla, 'I can t give you any, for if I IL starve myself" But as far as the local population was concerned, the source of authority to impose O remove restrictions and other pressures remained the District Officer, working through the police,and backed up by the military only if necessary. In the Philippines, COL. VALERIANO said,the situation was different from either the Algerian or the Malayan scene. With the breakdown of civil government in the heavily contested areas, including the disappearance of local police author- the military leader perforce became the principal figure in the fight against the Japanese. At the start of the Huk campaign, in early 1946,many public positions at the acted apply good stated do, again ity, PRIMARY OBJECTIVES OF COUNTERINSURGENCY 23 municipal, and provincial levels were unfilled as a result of war casualties and the inability of the postwar government to refill these vacancies Morever,most of the remaining civil servants either deserted their posts O1 refused to exercise their functions for fear of Huk reprisals Enterprising military officers, therefore, aware of the danger of an administrative vacuum, took on theburden ofcivil respon- sibility with the acquiescence (and in some cases the direct encouragement) of political leaders The public itself preferred to direct its problems to the lowly garrison officer rather than to the provincial executive who was known to lack the powers and instruments of government Thus, when Magsaysay took over in 1950, the only functioning authority in Huk-controlled areas was the military establish- ment; with local military commanders virtually free of interference Or restrictions from the civil government Magsaysay exploited this situation to thebestadvantage: COL. FERTIG pointed to the difficulty and danger of generalizing from such di- verse experience and political settings Even within the Philippines the situation varied; in Mindanao he himself was fortunate enough to have a civilian government of legally elected representatives of the people that took over; while in other parts of the islands it was necessary to create the political government: MR HOSMER then solicited opinions on optimum structures and approaches in the organization for counterguerrilla warfare, with realistic allowance for the fact that you have t0 use and make do with what is available COL. GALULA named several desiderata: (a) a territorial military command, in which the commander must be the sole and complete military boss; (b) two kinds of troops mobile reserves, not concerned with the population, who can be sta- tioned and moved as necessary and who require certain types of men and leaders, and 'grid" (or 'framework") troops who stay put and understand how to deal with the people; and (c) two types of leaders 3 those who work well with the population, and those whose main ability and inclination lie in fighting In the framework; BRIG. POWELL-JONES added, comes the opportunity for maintaining the facade of civil power: the police should be in control, responsible to the civil authorities; below them, the home guard; behind and supporting them, the military:_ COL. BOHANNAN (in answer to a question by COL FERTIG) commented on the effectiveness in the Philippines of special-purpose counterguerrilla units: a few small teams who moved into the jungle looking for guerrilla bases and leading other units to them: These special teams avoided fighting except in very advan- tageous situations, and, though would not in themselves have solved the lem even if there had been more of them, were an effective means of added harassment: village, they prob- they 24 COUNTERINSURGENCY : A SYMPOSIUM BRIG. POWELL-JONBS mentioned that in Malaya (unlike the Philippines, where the troops were constantly patrolling and coping with crises), harassment of the enemy in this manner, though not often directly productive, had the additional advantage of giving the troops & sense of being militarily engaged and not merely auxiliary policemen But;he pointed out,too much in the way of generalities should not be deduced ftom the Malayan campaign, which was an unusually difficult one for the communist enemy because of the way in which his forces were strung out in isolated pockets, the vast area of jungle, his lack of effective communica- tions, and the diverse (Chinese, Malay, and Indian) population. COL. VALERIANO explained that & task force in the anti-Huk campaign had,in addition to the military intelligence and civil affairs team,SO-called battalion combat teams On the staff of a battalion commander was a civil affairs officer who surveyed local defense assets in the area (the civilian police force, armed civilian volunteers, etc) These were supervised, trained, and mobilized s0 that might later take over local defense and fight any remaining guerrillas, leaving the army free to pursue and harass the fleeing enemy: BRIG. POWELL-JONES then gave a detailed account of the administrative setup, and the role of the military in this setup, in southern a jungle area with few roads and poor communications except those on the coast Malaya as a whole was divided into nine states, and each state was governed 04 by a war executive committee;' with the legal governor of the state at the head, and a committee t0 advise him that consisted of the head policeman, the head of the State Home Guard and senior soldier in the state, and responsible represent- ative civilians The state; in turn, Was divided into districts, each headed by the District Officer; with a local committee (head policeman, etc ) analogous to that at the state level. Allotted to the state would usually be a brigade; to the district, a battalion: Towns and other centers of population were wired and their eters lit at night; In the towns and larger villages, there were enough resident police to maintain securicy, but everywhere the locals themselves were enlisted as volun- teer police (special constables) and home guards, and the latter were given arms and distinguishing armbands. (Inevitably, some of the more isolated settlements were occasionally overrun by the enemy:) The battalion commander would be in general support of the civil authority in a given area. In some cases, an armed police unit- + a sO-called police operations was also in general suppOrt, but it was then usually attached to the battalion commander as an additional reinforcement The battalion never operated in a deep typical they Malaya;, perim- in, squad PRIMARY OBJECTIVES OF COUNTERINSURGENCY 25 settled area without the permission of the head civilian administrator, and it main- tained close liaison with the police 'framework In obviously suitable areas (for example, jungle parts known to have guerrillas in them), the local military com- mander might request; and be granted, a free hard, including permission to call for bomber support; but he would not g0 into guarded and inhabited areas except by prearrangement and on agreed schedules COL FERTIG, at MR HOSMER'$ request; then described and commented on the antiguerrilla organization of the Japanese in Mindanao. The original Japanese pIO gram called for using local police and elected officials, but it was soon abandoned. Instead, the Japanese reorganized their puppet troops into the "Bureau of Constab { ulary;' who proved more dangerous than the Japanese soldiers, for were con- taminators " (To avoid 1 "pbrother' problem, the Japanese brought Bureau f Constabulary soldiers to Mindanao from other islands) The guerrillas were able to harass them SO effectively, however; that they ceased to go out on patrols, and were eventually withdrawn entirely from all but two areas. The Japanese, who had an average of 150,000 men on the island of Mindanao, never committed many of their own firstline troops to the antiguerrilla campaign: The only exception was the foray of June 1943,when about 1800 men were involved for two weeks; but there, as in other instances, the guerrillas were back in posses- sion within ten for the Japanese consistently lacked co-ordination and wis- dom. For example; a harassed Japanese unit at times would move out, having first burned its supplies rather than leave them behind,and shortly afterward new troops would be moved into that very area and would be quickly starved out: The Japanese never launched an effective counterguerrilla operation, partly because failed to realize that were dealing with organized resistance, rather than; as thought; with isolated groups of bandits The result was a vir- tual stalemate until the guerrillas received enough supplies and heavy weapons by submarine t0 stage attacks As for the organization of the anti-Japanese guerrillas, each province sup- pofted one division (which might vary in size from 5500 to 18,000 men) As soon as an area was freed from Japanese control, the civilian authorities were re-estab- lished, and the military answered to them: As commander in Mindanao,COL FERTIG was in the unusual situation of being both President Quezon's representative to the civilian government and, as General MacArthurs commander; the military head. But the civilian institutions were dominant; with the army acting only as protectof and in combat: The civilians printed the money (no military scrip was they days, they they they 26 COUNTERINSURGENCY : 4 SY MPOSIUM used), and their courts operated in all but the Moslem areas Mindanao was more fortunate than Luzon in never being so thoroughly occupied. For one thing, the Japanese invasion of Mindanao came relatively late (after the fall of Bataan and just before Corregidor); for another, the guerrillas were more easily supplied, because waters and open seaways permitted submarines to approach closely. In COL FERTIG' $ view, the importance of access to outside support is one of the main principles of guerrilla warfare; even if it is not used, there is great psycho logical value in the soldiers' feeling that they are not cut off. (Conversely, BRIG. POWELL-JONES added, the counterguerrilla must aim at giving the guerrilla just that sense of being cut off:) For the benefit of troop morale, the facade of outside contact and support was maintained in the Philippines even if SO at times required a slight distortion of the facts COL. BOHANNAN (in feply to a question from MR. GREENE) said that; in the period before the American landings, the Huk movement received very little American support during the Japanese occupation, except where a local cOm- mander of legitimate guerrillas might make small reciprocal arrangements with a co-operative local Huk leader: The participants returned briefly to the problem of using terror wisely and selectively (as compared to the self-defeating indiscriminate manner in which the Japanese employed it ) BRIG. POWELL-JONES illustrated the advantage to be gained once from emphasis on legalicy: In Malaya, after some early cases of communist brutality, the British found it effective to subject & terrorist to the due process of civil law and sentence him t0 death: Knowing the process, others might think twice before adding to theif records any unnecessary brutality that could be brought up against them at the trial (just as they might hope for mitigating acts to weigh in their favor) In the Philippines, tOO, according to COL FERTIG, the stress was on necessities of warfare (not assassination), On concentration camps for the duration only, on hewing close to the legal line: Commenting On MR GREENE' $ observation that the FLN's terrorism of civil- ians had apparently not lost them the support of the Moslem population, BRIG POWELL-JONES emphasized that the counterinsurgents cannot win the support of the population unless have the power to protect it (In Malaya the British had tO bring people into perimeters before were able to do that) If this was invari- ably true; MR. GREENE wondered what had the population in the Philippines nevertheless loyal to the Americans, even though were not able t0 protect it against the indiscriminate terrorism of the Japanese: Was it fear of reprisals from deep doing again they they kept they PRIMARY OBJECTIVES OF COUNTERINSURGENCY 27 the guerrillas, o just stubborn hatred of the Japanese invaders? COL. VALERIANO thought it was essentially the latter: In COL. GALULA's view, the Communists themselves are aware of the possible boomerang effect of terrorism on & mass scale, and their principle is to use it only long enough to intimidate the civilians Similarly, the FLN, with one killing, would set an example strong enough to scare a large crowd into acquiescence and, once successful, would stop (Late:; having lost their hold on the people, they resorted to large-scale terrorism and were unsuccessful.) Yet there are cases, COL. GALULA recalled, in which strong measures not only acquiescence but active support: In China, for example, two refugee priests from Hainan Island, on reaching Hong Kong, reported that the people of theic island were hostile to the Communists Yet five months later, when the Chinese Nationalists twice tried to parachute an agent onto the island, each was met and cornered by the local militia The planes had been heard,and any militiaman knew that; if he failed to report it, he might be denounced by one of his colleagues on watch or by the militiaman in the next village ad, if so, would then undoubtedly be shot Again in China in 1952 the Nationalists staged a raid_planned as a hit-and- run operation _on a coastal peninsula that became an island at low tide, by ping parachutists followed by landings The 'chutists were met by a thousand mili- and the invaders lost the ensuing battle The Nationalists had miscalculated in expecting the militia to give Up without fighting, but the militia could not afford to, knowing that the invaders would not stay: (This confirmed BRIG. POWELL-JONES' earlier point about the importance of being able to protect the populace whose support you are seeking ) MR. HOSMER suggested that disrupting the guerrilla's program and timetable for conquest and take-over might constitute a target for counterinsurgency: How serious, he asked, had the effect of such & disruption on the guerrilla proved to be in past experience? BRIG. POWELL-JONES thought the answer to this question depended partly on how fexible the enemy was in reorienting strategy according to changed circumstances In Malaya, after the failure of theic initial plans, and their subsequent sal, the communist high command convened only about rwice a year t0 map out policy for the entire six-month period to come, and theif communications were pOOI. As a result, the British gained a crucial advantage over a considerable period if could change the situation in such a way as to make the agreed policy plicable. BRIG. POWELL-JONES recalled at least one instance where the guerrillas gain duty drop- tia, key disper- they inap- 28 COUNTERINSURGENCY : A SYMPOSIUM recognized a certain method as bad, but were unable t0 change it until the next semiannual meeting of their high command. COL. BOHANNAN added that a compe- tent guerrilla often did not publicize his targets and policy for fear of the negative psychological effect on the civilians that any failures Or setbacks would produce The decision tO advance from one of revolutionary warfare to the next; COL GALULA said in conclusion, is the most critical that the insurgent leadership has to make, and one that; if taken prematurely, has in the past led to crucial set- backs and even to total failure The Greeks in 1947 thought themselves strong enough to offer the national forces substantial targets, and failed; the FLN miscal- culated similarly in 1956; and the Vietminh came close to disaster in the first at- tempt to engage the French in set battles, and succeeded only on the second attempt; several years later, after had Chinese suppOft: phase they APRIL 17 , 1962,AM:* TACTICS AND TECHNIQUES OF COUNTERGUERRILLA WARFARE (I) Principles of tbe Defense of Fixed (Military and Nonmilitary) Installations in Guerrilla Warfare Patrolling Ambusb and Counterambusb, and Their Modern Refne- ments Optimum Size of Patrol and Ambusb Party Firearms for Ambusb and Patrol: Comparative Merits of Different Weapons; tbe Noisy as against tbe Silent Weabon; Some Preferences and Recommendations Clearing Potential Ambusb Sites: Two Views Tbe Importance of Ambusb Drill F Tbe Uses of Dogs Tbe Main Objective of Pursuing tbe Guerrilla (6 MR HOSMER suggested as the for the morning the 'tactics and techniques of counterguerrilla war;' with emphasis o detail He invited the participants to relate some of their particular problems and operations, their successes in terms of what had hoped to achieve, and the devices and methods that were espe- cially effective, as well as those that were not Beginning with the "defense of fixed installations' (which, at COL: BOHANNANs suggestion, was understood to include such nonmilitary installa- tions and common guerrilla objectives as powerplants and water reservoirs), COL. GALULA thought that the problem, particularly in the early and middle stages of a war, was the large number of installations to be defended, ignorance of which of these the' enemy was likely to attack; and inability to free enough troops to defend them all The principle on which to operate, therefore, is that of defending only installations that are absolutely essential, and of relying for the rest on simple devices (radio sets, flares, etc) to permit sending quick alarm calls for reinforcement and to give the population a sense of being protected. CAPT. JEAPES thought it difficult to generalize about what it took to defend an installation, since the need changed with the circumstances: COL WHITE, #Present: Col. Bohannan, Mc: Ellis, Col. Fertig, Col. Galula, Mr: Greene, Mr: Hosmet, Jeapes, Mr Rutkowski, Col. Shirley, Col. Valeriano, Col, White 29 topic they great Capt 30 COUNTERINSURGENCY : A SYMPOSIUM pointing Out incidentally that in the later stages of control the home could protect many installations and thus release regular troops for military pursuit of the enemy, suggested that the participants distinguish between routine precau- tionary defense measures, and those one takes in case of an actual attack. (Among the former he mentioned the use of wire fencing and lights, and also of cutters with which to mow down all grass for 20 to 25 yards from the wire fence to pre- vent people from crawling under it unobserved ~a simple and yet formidable job:) On this last point, COL. FERTIG commented that in grass country the tradi- tional methods of organizing ambush, counterambush, and patrols had proved ineffective because the high grass was the friend of the guerrilla, and the only workable way of patrolling an area had been to send a solid group of troops armed with shotguns COL. WHITE had found the use of light aircraft, early in the morn- a useful way to spot ambushes in advance: He emphasized the all-important need for mobile reserves that can be rushed quickly to any trouble spots Against a well-organized guerrilla, said COL. FERTIG, the defense of fixed installations is difficult; since he has the initiative and often chooses targets not in accordance with the defender s ideas of priority (for example, the case of the defenders who protected an oil depot but failed to guard the valve on the loading side of the tank, with the result that the guerrillas were able to empty the oil into the sea): COL: GALULA of various ways in which the Vietminh refined the ambush: Aside from the continuing problem for the French of avoiding especially the ambushing of their reinforcements, there was also a constant danger of infiltra- tion of fixed installations Viet troops would be hidden among peasants in the sO-called camions cbinois; a battalion of militia in disguise once followed a Catholic procession into & town in Tonkin: Ambushing a village at night and then attacking the relief column was & frequent trick, repeated quite recently in South Vietnam: Even the use of helicopters against such attacks has never been very successful because a well-organized assault will be too quickly over: (A ambush, COL WAITE thought; should be successful in the first thirty seconds) COL. SHIRLEY added that the value of helicopters was further limited by the availability of excellent cover for the withdrawing guerrillas; in Malaya the trucks bringing relief forces often were successfully ambushed. The British attempted to armor- some of them and used various other devices to protect the men in them. In Algeria (COL. GALULA), vehicles were armored and, to enable the soldiers to get out quickly when attacked, the seating arrangement in the trucks was modi- fied. Instead of having two rowS against the sides of the truck with the soldiers guard ing, spoke good plate TACTICS OF COUNTERGUERRILLA WARFARE (I) 31 facing the rows were placed lengthwise toward the middle, with the men facing out: To avoid concentrated attack on your convoys, it is essential to allow enough space between vehicles (CAPT: JBAPES) And armored cars should accompany the convoy (COL. WHITE) As regards the counterguerrilla's equipment, COL GALULA had found shot- guns very effective as short-range antipersonnel weapons, and he emphasized the advantage of using weapons too heavy for the guerrilla to carry from the scene with him. Flame throwers, CAPT. JEAPES thought; were to be ruled out, for it would be dangerous to start a fire in areas that you yourself have to get through: COL. FERTIG recalled his practice in the Philippines of giving his own guerrillas just five founds O so of ammunition per rifle, S0 that they could not stay long on target but had to run back to their assembly points for reloading, thereby forcing the Japanese to chase many individual men at once and SO disperse their forces For the protection of fixed installations COL GALULA stressed the usefulness of night patrolling, starting before sundown and continuing till 4 Of 5 A.M: (During the day there is not much danger of attack, the counterguerrillas' superiority in manpowel, planes, etc ) COL SHIRLEY, incidentally, was emphatic on the need for frequent ambush- drill practice -at least once a week, he thought-at specified and publicized times and places. To illustrate the dangers of sporadic, spontaneous drilling, he recalled coming across an incident in Malaya in which some zealous elements of a Malay regiment, imbued with the importance of preparing and being prepared for the ambush, had decided to stage a drill, with live ammunition, on what they believed to be a deserted stretch of land, only to find their fire returned instantly by the home guard of a neighboring tin miner, a New Zealander, who believed himself under real attack: The mock ambushers, in turn, assumed that had acci- dentally stumbled on a nest of Communists, and the battle raged on for quite & while before the mistake was discovered, which almost miraculously had caused no casualties Returning to some of the requirements for the successful ambush, CAPT: JEAPES a detailed description of the 24-hour deep-in ambushes that his SAS (Special Air Service) Regiment had conducted against the Chinese terrorists (the CTs) in the tropical jungle. About twelve men would lie in wait for up to ten or eleven with four men in the fring line at any one time (they would be on for two hours, then off for four, with shifts overlapping), and often would get nothing in the entire time- a tiring and frustrating operation that required much patience, discipline, and self-control. This applied only to the in, given they gave days, they 32 COUNTERINSURGENCY : A SYMPOSIUM operational hours, that is, the daylight hours. There was no need to extend the routine far into the night, when the thickness of the jungle the terrorists from moving, though on major trails, for example, night ambushes were never- theless maintained at times It was impossible for an ambush team to move during the without danger of being discovered; hence, if the men expected to meet the enemy On & certain night, they went out the night before and low through- out the following COL. WHITE on the importance and also the difficulty of the ambush and counterambush: In his Malayan experience it took twenty men to maintain a ten-man ambush; if enemy troops were expected to pass by & certain place at a certain time, the soldiers would go out as much as three in advance and lie virtually never used existing tracks Indeed, in going back and forth between fring position and rest camp, the men would never use the same foute twice t0 avoid leaving recognizable traces in the grass. CAPT: JEAPES, 0n the contrary, had preferred using only a single narrow track, however and unmistakable it might become as a result of repeated traffic, gambling that the enemy would not stumble on it Even if he did, there was a chance that he would follow it out of curiosity and thus stumble into an ambush or a base camp More likely, terrorists coming across such a trail, unless their number was quite large, would try to withdraw unseen, not knowing how many troops might find at the end of the trail. There followed some discussion among COL. WHITE, COL. SHIRLEY , and CAPT: JEAPES as to the wisdom of ambushing the tracks in the expectation that the enemy would use them COL. SHIRLEY' $ experience had been that the troops spent many fruitless hours waiting for the enemy along the tracks, and only a surprisingly small number of Chinese casualties were inflicted during the brief fire fights characteristic of the ambush Indeed, in most instances in neither guerrilla nor counterguerrilla achieved a very high percentage of casual- ties through ambush: COL. GALULA described an unorthodox but extremely successful experiment (( with the 'one-man ambush;' which had been tried by 2 friend of his who com- manded a sector in Indochina A single man, it turned out, was almost invulnerable, and the system permitted the setting of a large number of ambushes As to the demoralizing effect of frequent ambushes on the guerrilla, CAPT: JEAPES believed it to be an important aspect of psychological warfare. A CT troop 0f, say , fourteen men that had run into ambushes on three consecutive kept day lay day: agreed days Jow. They deep they Malaya, TACTICS OF COUNTERGUERRILLA WARFARE (I) 33 nights and lost a couple of men in each was apt to come out and surrender on the fourth COL. SHIRLEY agreed and suggested that, if ultimately the morale effect on the enemy is indeed related to the lethal effect on him, the operational researcher might devote himself to finding the threshold beyond which the guerrilla will not accept the hazards of his occupation and will be inclined to return t0 civilian life cOL. VALERIANO saw this as another argument (valid at least in the Philippine situation) fof not tying up the bulk of the defending forces in the perimeter of a fixed installation but deploying it on the outside; then inviting the enemy to attack the perimeter, and firing at him from the rear: To anticipate likely points of attack and to secure the foutes needed for mobile reserves, COL. VALERIANO' $ forces developed an elaborate procedure that involved mining (o marking as 'mined") the likely ambush points and, on the basis of a survey by the intelligence officer, classifying places and routes by various categories calling for diverse types of action 4( From the guerrilla point of view, COL. FERTIG had found counterpatrolling" a single coastal road between two strong points, where the enemy patrol moved regularly back and forth, an effective tactic requiring only a few men. Constant harassment up and down the track, with oly an occasional ambush, was enough to make the Japanese decide to patrol less frequently and only on moonlit nights This effort had the added advantage that; by scattering your ambush forces over & wide area, you forced the enemy to dissipate his counterguerrilla forces: COL. SHIRLEY wondered whether the question of the optimum size of a guerrilla or counterguerrilla unit had been fully explored. In Malaya it had been handled pragmatically. A patrol would be about a dozen men strong; yet some were as small as men, while others went to company strength Ideally, 6t he thought, the smaller the better' COL WHITE stated his own preference for the three-man patrol (s0 that two could carry the one who might be wounded), and recalled that in Malaya an entire battalion would sometimes swamp an area in such teams of three MR GREENE mentioned a number of devices that the Viet Cong ambushers are using today along with actual weapons, and that; together, make the ambush a formidable factor: (1) traps of various kinds (covered and camouflaged holes; with sharp stakes at the bottom that have poison O1 urine on them to cause infec- tion; bent-over saplings with sharpened pieces of bamboo attached to them; buried pieces of wood with 4- or 5-inch iron spikes sticking up into the soft day: typical four up 34 COUNTERINSURGENCY: A SYMPOSIUM cover; very effective in muddy terrain, where patrolling soldiers are barefoot Of only in tennis shoes; crude traps that close over a man'$ calf); (2) the practice of setting up at ambush points & dense series of sharpened bamboo stakes pointed toward the trail Or road, SO that ambushed defense troops will impale them- selves as they toward the source of the fire; (3) mines made of artillery shells with electronic detonators controlled by wire, so that civilian traffic or lightly loaded convoy vehicles can pass undisturbed, and the mine can be set off under; say, a truckload of soldiers All but the last device can be produced cheaply and with Iocal labor and materials COL. GALULA commented that most of these devices were used already by the Chinese Communists, as were underground caches with interconnecting tunnels (even, in Indochina, under paddy fields filled with water): COL. FERTIG recalled the use of tetanus-infected bamboo spikes against the Japanese, all the more effective because an incapacitated soldier represents a greater burden to his side than a dead one: CAPT. JEAPES cited a practice, developed in Arabia, of pushing forward a 3-ton truck with a well-protected driver and allowing it to be blown up (usually with no harm to the driver)-a tactic that lent itself to use against the ambush, though it was not s0 employed in Arabia. Upon a question from MR RUTKOWSKI, the group then went into a detailed discussion of various firearms, and specifically of the virtue and desirability of noisy as compared to silent weapons, for use in ambush and counterambush There was agreement with COL VALERIANO's view that, in general, silent weapons are more desirable from the guerrilla's, that from the ambushing party $, of view, because they delay the reaction time, and that; for the same reason, the defender would prefer a noisy gun But other factors obviously entered into the choice of weapons: the morale effect of & particular gun on a particular enemy; the preference of the soldier carrying and using it; its weight; its hitting power; the degree of training required for handling it; its chief intended use and effect (close combat, surprise, etc.); the terrain in which the soldier is operating; the general scenario The experiences and opinions of the participants are briefly summarized as follows: COL SHIRLEY: Though it is easier t0 make & noisy gun, a silent one that also turns out to be a killer would have a highly demoralizing effect In Malaya the most aggressive men in the patrol chose the Bren gun, the heaviest and not nearly the most practical. Research established no explanation for their preference Yet it turned out that the Communists feared the Bren gun far more than the lighter Jeap point is, TACTICS OF COUNTERGUERRILLA WARFARE (I) 35 weapons that the British carried, possibly because lost more of their men through it, but possibly also because of its vicious noise Silent weapons, by and large, have less hitting power than noisy ones, and in an ambush you might decide to sacrifice hitting power for the advantage of silence and the enemy' $ delayed reaction. As to a weapon'$ stopping power, the scenario that is, what is likely to happen to the man who doesn't go on running and fghting) as well as the soldier's make-up and conditioning will largely determine whether; when injured, he falls down incapacitated or goes on fighting There are great differences in reaction from one nation, Of One face, t0 another: A larger number of hits will offset a relative lack of stopping powef: The shotgun, though not desirable for large military units, is a weapon for small groups The optimum velocity and size of the round remain to be explored. The British thought the smaller, high-velocity weapons the most effective, but the soldiers' own opinions did not fully confirm this view- COL WHITE: The Belgian FN rifle, which is a noisy lethal weapon, was proba- the one most feared by the guerrillas in Malaya in recent years An example of poor stopping power was the old 9-mm Owen (as distinct from the recently issued new Owen) The shotgun, on the other hand, was very desirable for a quick surprise operation at close range Against the danger of a surprise attack in close country, it is enough to a shotgun to the forward scout to protect himself and give the rest of the squad a chance to deploy themselves Or get away: As to the most desirable size of round, much research into the problem was done in Malaya in the last two years of the emergency, based on systematic examination of the dead fof the effect of various types of rounds on them: COL FERTIG: The soldier's feaction to an enemy weapon is not necessarily a reflection of its practical usefulness The Japanese, according to a report in the Philippines, placed the Tommy gun first on the list of feared weapons,theBrowning automatic rifle second, and the carbine last They were much frightened also by the 2.36 bazooka (used by the Americans in place of artillery and very easily deto- nated) They themselves used hand grenades very effectively; the American troops did not like to use them: The American soldiers' preferred weapon (and COL FERTIG'$ choice for the one-man patrol) was the shotgun, with the 30-inch barrel cut down to 22 inches (rather than the 18 inches of the sawed-off gun) for slightly better range. The perennial problem also was how to keep the ammunition in moist, tropical country ( problem mentioned by several speakers, along with various methods that had been tried to solve it; such as covering each round they good bly give typical dry 36 TACTICS OF COUNTERGUERRILLA WARFARE (I) with candle O1 sealing wax) In answer tO a question from MR HOSMER as [0 the best way to equip a small patrol in the jungle or heavy brush: The lead man would probably want a Browning automatic rifle (and would prefer an Enfield to a car- bine), and there should be at least one very noisy weapon (a Tommy gun) for the illusion of greater manpower that it produces. COL. BOHANNAN: When seeking combat; you want a silent weapon, which puts the enemy at an initial disadvantage because of the slower reaction time; when on the defensive, You want the noisiest possible to scare the enemy away- The World War II T-17 (impact-detonating) rifle grenade, with a better-than- average range of about 150 yards, proved very effective in the Philippines and might well be SO in counterguerrilla warfare today. And the Philippine army developed a double-barreled, fully automatic carbine that fired about 1700 rounds per minute, with little accuracy but enormous noise effect: As for the optimum small-arms round, there has been no appreciable advance made in the last sixty years A desirable round would be something with characteristics at least equal to those of the carbine cartridge and no larger than the .32 short pistol cartridge, so that its small size and weight would permit its being easily carried; even the 223 round, suggested by CAPT: JEAPES, would still be too large CAPT. JEAPES, commenting on the relative punch of different weapons dis- cussed by other speakers, mentioned several weapons (the 30-caliber carbine, the 9-mm Sten gun, and the Sterling) that had been found undesirable in the fight against the CTs,and also against the Mau Mau in Kenya, just because lacked penetrating power: He challenged another speaker' s statement; howevet, that a shotgun hit is a minor wound In his experience, most men will at least go down from it; and; if the gun is fired at close fange, will be hurt badly - The mum weapon will vary, aside from more obvious factors; in accordance with the terrain (twigs in jungle can be a danger with easily triggered guns), with the length of the march on which it is to be carried, etc_,and it is difficult to generalize. COL. GALULA: For a one- Or two-man patrol, the preferted weapon would be the submachine gun. But the excellent new German Setme, a gun manufactured in Spain- something like & submachine gun with the power ofa rifle t could make the submachine gun obsolete: The .22 rifle with a dum-dum bullet would perhaps be the best caliber in its category. Power is relatively unimportant, as any live ammunition will usually do the job of putting out the man who is hit MR RUTKOWSKI thought that shotgun technology, in particular, had advanced little since World War I and was an important area for improvement: they they opti- TACTICS OF COUNTERGUERRILLA WARFARE (I) 37 MR GREENE, referring to the demoralizing effect of noise on those under attack, noted that bombs in World War II had been equipped with whistling devices to enhance the morale effect of aerial attacks, and he therefore speculated on the possibility of making guns and rifles even noisier than need be: MR HOSMER next directed the discussion to the difficult and timely problem of the counterambush, and solicited comments on possible techniques for both heavy country and open areas COL. GALULA stated that, where you are in danger of being ambushed, it is well to avoid having cover too close, and that a 20- to 30-yard clearing on either side of the road is therefore desirable-a statement that was seconded by COL. VALERIANO and COL. WHITE but challenged by CAPT: JEAPES and COL BOHANNAN: COL: VALERIANO, stressing the amount of work such clearing operations involved, and hence the to be selective, reported having pinpointed in the Philippines mainly those areas where close cover greatly improved the ambushing opportu- nity (for example, a promontory with overhanging trees), and having set the civil officials to clearing them under the supervision of security officers (In dangerous spots where clearing would have been tOo arduous, a few soldiers would ostentatiously when they were sure to be observed, so as to make the guerrillas believe they were mining the area) In Malaya, said cOL. WHITE, civilian support was enlisted even more widely in that every plantation owner was made responsible for keeping his plantation cleared of the underbrush: CAPT. JEAPES argued that an enemy could hit you as well at 20 yards as at 2, and that the fact of your having an unobstructed area around you actually gave him an added advantage. COL. SHIRLEY pointed out that it would depend on tactics in a given situation whether it was more desirable_ when ambushed, to jump into high grass and brush, even on the chance that guer- rillas might be hiding in it; 0r whether you would want t0 be sure of having the enemy at least 20 yards off. Initial large-scale clearing attempts in his experience had demanded much organization of the civilian population; efforts to accomplish it with chemical vegetation killers had not come Off. COL. FERTIG described how Japanese plane crews, late in the war in & heavy: hemp area (the best hiding imaginable), had set Up effective guards and ambushes around the individual Japanese planes, until the guerrillas learned to counterambush them with one-man patrols (told to shoot at anything that moved) and eventually forced them out of the hemp area to positions where they could be attacked by bombing As regards immediate action in response to an ambush, COL. WHITE described they need dig caught 38 COUNTERINSURGENCY: A SYMPOSIUM a fairly simple procedure, based on the patrol's OT convoy crews careful drill practice, by which each man knows in advance whether to go right or left; to high Or low ground, and the main principle is to shoot back and then quickly get out in the direction away from the fire: MR: HOSMER inquired into possible techniques that might yield warning of an ambush: COL. SHIRLEY mentioned the hopes that the British in Malaya had placed in (pointers) accompanying patrols, and the excellent pointers the troops were furnished. Yet in his experience, possibly because of inept handling, these had not been effective Much more useful had been human trackers from Borneo, the Dyaks, who developed a high degree of woodcraft' and were alert to human smells, depressed grass blades, the smallest disturbance COL: FERTIG The Japanese, who introduced war early in 1943, abandoned them after about five months, which suggests that too, did not find them useful in tracking down the guerrillas. But the hill people whom the Colonel's own forces relied on were uncanny in predicting ambushes; they claimed they could smell" a Japanese, and the guerrillas never doubted their word. After the American landings in Mindanao, when the Japanese became the hunted, the ideal fighting force, and eventually standard unit; with which to SpOt and wipe out the isolated Japanese patrols was a 200-man company of American trOops,to which was added a 60-man company of Filipinos who acted as guards and fanks and spotted the Japanese CAPT. JEAPES had a much higher opinion than the previous speakers of the potential value of provided were properly used and their limitations recognized. In his experience, patrol (mainly Alsatians) had been very keen in spotting ambushes o CT camps (they would sit down and in the exact direction of the enemy); and tracker (mostly Labrador retrievers) had been used quite effectively in follow-up operations He maintained further that keenness of smell was not the monopoly of the native. Englishmen, after living in the jungle for some time, learned to smell soap, cigar smoke; cooking rice, etc,, at 50 to 60 yards: COL. WHITE agreed. Soldiers in the Malayan jungle (not allowed to smoke O use brilliantine on their haic) seemed to develop the abilicy to smell the difference between an Australian, a Gurkha, and a New Zealander; yet the Australian bush- men were better still; and the Dyaks were best of all As for the British in Malaya used three types (tracker ambush and guard dogs), but had their limitations Each was only as good as his handler; it was difficult to ration dogs dogs agreed. dogs they, dogs, they dogs point dogs dogs, dogs, they dogs, d0g TACTICS OF COUNTERGUERRILLA WARFARE (I) 39 them; soon wore themselves out; and the dog s handler was good fof nothing but the Of the three,the guard was the least vulnerable. Tracker were 04 useful as members of the highly specialized 'tracker team; which typically con- sisted of one lieutenant and ten bushmen, heavily armed, plus eight (only one or two of which accompanied the team at any one time) When these expert trail followers were unable t0 find the enemys track, the often did. COL. GALULA found that served another valuable service in being often the first to be shot at, thus warning and sparing the men: Several of the participants thought that were also a psychological weapon in view of the unnerving effect they had on the men being chased o trailed by them: COL BOHANNAN recalled that the Japanese in the Philippines picked up any untrained and ran them into the jungle just to demoralize the guerrillas; COL WHITE reported having paraded the British before the villagers in Malaya on every occasion to impress people with their fierceness (and, incidentally, to the in training_a most important part of keeping them useful) Asked by MR HOSMER whether, once the counterguerrilla had found a trail, he could overtake the enemy, COL. WHITE admitted that; in Malaya, the Chinese were faster than their pursuers, or night; and were hardly, if ever, caught: COL VALERIANO and CAPT: JEAPES felt that the crucial objective of pursuit was to the guerrilla moving, establish his general route and direction,and then anticipate him by cutting him off with blocking forces, interception units, or helicopters Moreover, if you can keep the chase up for, say, twenty feeling so constantly pursued may create psychosis in his group. Thereafte:,; evidence of the guerrilla's demoralization, the sight of frightened,bedraggled men begging for food and infor- mation from the villagers along their route of withdrawal, will have a powerful impact on the population As hard-pressed guerrillas lose theit poise, they lose their personal prestige, especially in the Asian countries, where losing face is tantamount t0 defeat: For this very reason, there have been cases of proud guerrilla commanders who elected, against their better military judgment; to be annihilated by the counterinsurgents in a final battle: A guerrilla leader who shows fear of being captured o cornered is bound to infect not only his followers but also the supporting populace, and in the resulting chaos the insurgents' supply, escape, and intelligence-gathering systems will then be easy to infiltrate or Otherwise disrupt to a point that precludes their restoration by the guerrilla side. Generally speaking, COL. VALERIANO pointed out, communist guerrillas, no matter how dispersed, will eventually have to reassemble, and it is important, they dog dog dogs dogs dogs dogs dogs dogs dogs dogs keep day keep days, 40 COUNTERINSURGENCY: A SYMPOSIUM therefore, to establish the likeliest assembly and then try to infiltrate it _ possibly in civilian (guerrilla) disguise and sOw confusion. (He told of finding an entire guerrilla unit; which seemingly had vanished into thin air; in the nearest village, pretending to be simple farmers) COL WHITE added his Own experience that guerrillas tended eventually to feturn to the areas with which were most familiar, usually their home districts. COL BOHANNAN concluded the discussion by pointing t one limiting factor in the doctrine of pursuit just described, that is, the need to make optimum use of the forces available For it is easy t0 tie up too many troops chasing too few guerrillas, thereby neglecting areas that should be secured. point they APRIL 17 , 1962, PM:* TACTICS AND TECHNIQUES OF COUNTERGUERRILLA WARFARE (II) Border Control: Terrain,Manpower,and Cost as Limiting Factors; a Detailed Description of How Borders Were Sealed in Algeria Containing the Enemy witbin a Known Area Massive "Saturation" Tactics Encirclement and Sweeping Operations: Planned or Improvised; Infltrating tbe Guerrillas by Exploiting Tbeir Lack of Intercommuni- cation Pseudogang Operations and Otber Uses of Disguise Emergency Alert Sys- tems: Tbe Effective Use of Radio in Algeria Drying Up tbe Enemys Supply of Arms and Equibment: Various Metbods Food Denial ~ Surface Logistics: A Typical Backpack for Deep-jungle Penetration; tbe Suitability of Present-day Vebicular Equip- ment for Guerrilla Terrain; Ampbibious Carriers; tbe Inadequacy of River V ebicles; tbe Case for Planes and Helicobters in Support of Ground Troops; Aircraft for Reconnais- sance Air Logistics: Tbe Pro and Con of Air Supply; Free-drop versus Paracbute; Compensating for Loss of Surprise; tbe Morale Effects of an Airlift Capability 0n tbe Troops of Botb Sides MR HOSMER suggested placing the emphasis in the afternoon's discussion on other tactics and techniques of counterguerrilla operations such as baiting the enemy, encirclement and sweeping operations, area and route denial, and border control starting with this last problem In COL. FERTIG$ view, You must define the area of concern when talking about border control. Sealing a bordef to the extent that COL. GALULA had reported its being done in Algeria (where eventually only an inconsequentially small number could penetrate it) may be possible in open terrain, but would not necessarily be feasible in certain mountain and jungle areas In regions where there in only one trail into the country (for example, the Red River foute from South China into Northern Indochina), it may o may not be practicable Thinking always of men on # Present: Col. Bohannan, Col. Brundage, Mr: Ellis, Col Fertig, Col. Galula, Mr: Greene, Mr: Hos- mer, Capt Jeapes, Mr Rutkowski, Col. Shirley, Mr: Tanham, Col. Valeriano, Col. White 41 42 COUNTERINSURGENCY: A SYMPOSIUM foot ~ not of highway or rail traffic it is virtually impossible, in a great cases, to seal a border completely: In Malaya, according to COL. SHIRLEY, no serious attempt was ever made to seal the border between Malaya and Thailand, although the British did try , by certain political pressures On the Thai,to prevent Malayan Communists from train- in safety in Thailand and moving south across the border with comparative ease As one looks almost hopelessly at the tremendous border of Vietnam, only the sharpening of orthodox methods concentratingon the mostlikely roads and tracks, etc_ suggests itself Modern devices, such as radar, for detecting movement; though probably usable in some areas, do not promise to solve that particular border problem: COL: BOHANNAN pointed out (and COL. SHIRLEY agreed readily) that one must carefully select from the entire of orthodox tricks those that lend themselves to a given situation Thus, the ideal method~clearing an area 200 to 1000 yards wide along the border, then stringing wire along its full length and controlling it from the air _ would be prohibitively expensive in view of likely results, whereas patrolling for, say, five miles inside the border might be more promising However; COL WHITE'$ experience of spending six weeks on the Thai border; knowing that a large camp of Chinese terrorists, with constant courier-crossing activity, was within four hours' march, had proved to him the relative futility of that kind of patrolling in mountainous areas where, furthermore, people on either side of the border could easily intermingle without being identified. Under the circumstances, using reconnaissance aircraft combined with active patrolling tO keep the enemy from building roads and bringing in convoys and large bands had a certain nuisance value, and at least slowed down his progress toward large Opera- tions, though these methods could never stop the experienced guerrilla In answer to a question from MR HOSMER as tO the possibility of picking up the guerrillas once small bands have crossed the border and re-formed themselves into larger units, and harassing them on their way to targets and settled areas, COL WHITE thought this would require luck, vast numbers of troops, and a less difficult terrain than either the Malayan-Thai or the Vietnamese border: As to whether it is worth the effort even to try t0 maintain border control under such difficult con- ditions, COL. WHITE indicated that it would depend on the individual commanders view of the need for harassment and on the size of his reserve Y and most com- manders are unlikely to have enough troops to spare: COL. BRUNDAGE opened the question of water boundaries, which several speakers agreed were far easier to control. COL SHIRLEY emphasized the greater many ing bag deep TACTICS OF COUNTERGUERRILLA WARFARE (II) 43 usefulness there of modern technical detection aids, even on SO a coastline a5 that of Vietnam; provided you have the means to follow up on detection He compared today' s advanced technology to the lack of technical gadgetry in Malaya, where the British, fying low over the jungle known to be hiding Communists, could not see them (he was frankly skeptical of COL WHITE' $ contention that some of the pilots could) COL. SHIRLEY, as an electronics specialist; had conceived the idea that an ait- with its radar tuned to the metal barreling of the rifles that soldiers moving in file through the jungle were bound to be carrying would be able to spot such hidden forces in & terrain that normally contained not a particle of metal. He sent the suggestion to the War Office for thorough scientific exploration, and also tried it himself experimentally. Both attempts failed The War Office reply called the idea unworkable; and COL. SHIRLEY, in a day's flight over the jungle, was unable to penetrate the canopy at any time, and even failed to up on his radar screen a Sunderland fouf-engine fying boat at anchor directly below the reconnaissance plane: He thought, however, that this negative showing was almost entirely a reflec- tion of the poor maintenance of equipment typical of operations in Southeast Asia With today s American equipment; a much better job could be done in this difficult environment, though it still would appear impossible to seal off an entire border in such a way. MR HOSMER asked COL VALERIANO about the methods he had used to prevent Huk bands, once were identified in a given area, from extending their activ- ities beyond it: The answer: aggressive patrolling around the area by local police or any trOops that can be spared, and gaining the co-operation of the people in spotting the Huks (a kind of help that is obtained only through the systematic screening of villages and routine interrogation of all individuals to identify those who have no business in a given place) COL. BOHANNAN added, howevef, that it had proved virtually impossible in the Philippines to contain any band of trained guerrillas who wanted to leave an area It was better; therefore, to patrols moving all the time, leaving the guerrillas uncertain where might meet such a patrol, and to hope for a chance encounter between them The fact that the guerrillas are usually fragmented into small groups was recog nized as a major problem for counterinsurgency COL SHIRLEY once proposed a massive operation in Malaya, in which an entire brigade was to saturate & terrorist- infested area However, this idea was turned down because it had been tried earlier with almost no success. While there might be psychological advantage in not dis- missing this tactic and thus keeping the guerrilla fearful that his area might be long plane pick they keep they 44 COUNTERINSURGENCY: A SYMPOSIUM 66 'saturated" by the other side at any time, such an operation can never be expected to yield a great many kills, given the guerrillas' faculty for just fading away: In the Philippines, according t0 COL. BOHANNAN, saturation operations in themselves picked up people only by accident; but an ancillary device was to stay-behind groups (preferably near trails and springs) when the forces were osten- sibly pulled out;so that the Huks,after felt safe enough to come out of hiding, could be picked up by them. COL. VALERIANO described one such successful opera- tion In a Huk area believed to be safe for the guerrillas (in swamp terrain that made pursuit difficult), and hence a regular rallying and supply center for them, seven rifle companies, including commandos with civilian clothes and radio sets in their packs, marched in; a few later; having left the commandos behind, the troops marched out in full view ofthe inhabitants, and as soon as the Huks emerged, the commandos gave them lively action Wherever this principle was (it was done in mountain areas,too), signal communications to synchronize move- ments were of the essence Thus, part of the stay-behind party could fraternize with the Huks, pretending to belong to another Huk unit; and notify other parts of the group where to block or intercept the enemy. At MR HOSMER $ suggestion, COL. GALULA then 2 detailed expose on the very successful methods for border control in Algeria that he had briefly alluded to earlier: Figure 2 is an illustration of the cypical complex of fence barriers L COL GALULA called it a "barrage' L on the Algerian-Tunisian and Algerian-Moroccan borders. At the very beginning the French made the mistake of building the barrage directly against the border, where it could too easily be attacked from Moroccan or Tunisian soil. Thereafter, they allowed a considerable margin between the actual border and the first of the several parallel barricades ~1 a simple wire barrier; about 1 to 11/2 meters high,to the Iivestock and wild animals out of the mined and electrified area inside the barrage About five meters behind this first fence came an entanglement of barbed wire, which occupied a width of about ten meters and was mined. Next was a three-meter-high electrified (S000 volt) fence of killing as well as sending the alarm when touched. Immediately parallel to it ran a road to permit access t0' the fence for maintenance and repair: Behind the road was another mined wire entanglement, and next t0 that an unmined wire fence to keep unauthorized people from the danger area Finally, & well-paved road on the inner perimeter was patrolled at night by vehicles that were spaced at frequent, regular intervals and used large searchlights During the the barrage was patrolled from the air: A series of gates in the barbed wire and fences permitted leave they days applied good gave keep capable day, TACTICS OF COUNTERGUERRILLA WARFARE (II) 45 International border between Morocco ond Algeria Low wire fence to mark beginning of 'barrage" and to prevent cattle from going through, to | 1/2 meters high Mass of barbed wire, 10 meters wide, mined Electric fence, 3 meters high, 5000 volt Fence maintenance road Mined wire entanglement Unmined fence t0 keep people out Patrol rood MOROCCO ALGERIA Total width up to 40 meters FIG. 2 _ Typical Complex of Fence Barriers 0n Moroccan-Algerian Border access to the outer perimeter for occasional patrols and defensive action: For the alarm system, the entire barrage area had been so compartmentalized that the pre- cise spot ofany disturbance was immediately known wherever the alarm registered, and mobile reserves could therefore reach it in minimum time The power for the electric fence came from stations spaced from ten to twenty miles apart; and alarms at the power stations indicated if and where the fence had been cut or grounded. False alarms, set off by animals, were an occasional problem: Although the initial impact of the barrage was tremendous, the FLN gradually found ways of crossing it: A couple of scouts would cut through the minefield,then straddle the electric fence with a tall wooden stepladder, and signal to other troops to follow them across it: In this manner; however, it would take them four hours t0 traverse an area that might normally take a mere fraction of that time. In trying to delay still further; if not entirely to stop them, the French found radar 46 COUNTERINSURGENCY: A SYMPOSIU M very helpful, although had a problem in interpreting signals. To illustrate the over-all effectiveness of thebarrier, in one instance,an entire company attempted to cIOSs, but only one man succeeded, while S1 withdrew, and the rest were caught; in another case, out of 1OOO0 who tried, 6 of the 110 who crossed the first barrier survived and escaped, and the others died or were captured: The system was costly in money and labor Erecting the fence (a total of about 2500 kilometers, from the coast down along the two borders well into the desert) consumed about one-sixth of total military expenses for an entire year; also, rain and other factors required constant on the electric fence, and waterproofing the mine detonators continued to be a problem: But the expenditures were well worth while in view of the troops saved. Moreover; the system, though easiest to construct in flat, open countfy, is workable in any terrain. In Algeria, for example, it extended the full length of the enormous Moroccan border, including some very diffcult terrain in the north, where there were typically two O even three barrage lines. From early 1958 on the FLN was unable to bring supplies across that border: All of their crossing attempts were unsuccessful, Or in such small numbers as to make no significant difference Among other difficulties, ran out of men trained to perform the unpleasant job of clearing the minefields Also,the dropping of flares at night to illuminate the barrage added to the discomfort of the guerrillas And once the French soldiers manning the patrols along the Moroccan border received large searchlights with a fange of 2 kilometers, these completely dis- couraged attacks Fortunately for the French, the FLN never resorted to the much- feared diversionary tactic of mounting several attacks, with a number of crossings, at one time MR GREENE speculated on the possibility of getting electricity out of an electric fence system for use in the hinterland for civilian homes, radio, perimeter lighting, etc an incidental benefit by which to charge off some of the heavy investment: MR HOSMER turned to the topic of encirclement and sweeping operations, and COL: GALULA began the discussion by distinguishing between (a) encircle- ment operations that You prepare in advance; and (b) those that are improvised The former requice a deal of personnel (they lose the benefit of surprise and hence must be made large enough to be sure of catching some of the enemy); the latter benefit by helicopter transport: For the prepared encirclement; which must be accomplished within & single he advocated the kind of cylinder-and-piston operation he had described earlier, during which the perimeter troops must themselves in, assuming an essentially defensive position: they repaifs they such great day, dig TACTICS OF COUNTERGUERRILLA WARFARE (II) 47 COL. SHIRLEY amplifed the last statement by a reference to Malaya, where air bombings were sometimes used, in the absence of the cylinder around the piston; in order to stop the gaps through which the enemy might escape t a method he regarded as not very satisfactory. COL. GALULA' s statement that aircraft (even planes used only for troop transport) will inevitably slow down the guerrilla, COL' SHIRLEY thought this was true only in the daytime and,furthermore, depended much on the terrain: Useful wherever enemy forces were in the open and in large groups, aircraft had been quite ineffectual, for example, in Malaya, because of the dense ground cover: CAPT: JEAPES, in his encirclement operations against the Chinese terrorists, had found ways of turning the guerrilla's faculty for dispersal to the advan- tage of his own side. He would place small-party ambushes in a large circle around the target and then send three or four larger units into the area. In an effort to get away from these units and out of the area, the CTs would scatter and run into the ambushes similar tactics, it appeared, had been used in Algeria and also in Malaya Furthermore, as COL. GALULA pointed Out, any operation that results in the random scattering of the guerrillas affords an opportunity for infiltrating them, for have no system of intercommunication and are at a loss to tell the difference between an unknown guerrilla unit that is genuine and One that is a plant In the Philippines COL VALERIANO had had considerable success with infiltra- tion based on this particular ruse He trained and conditioned a volunteer force of 4 officers and 76 men (Force "X") in a special camp, to the point where they resembled a typical Huk in the minutest detail To add realism, two wounded enlisted men volunteered to join Force X Then, equipped with weapons originally captured from the Huks, Force X staged & sham battle against COL. VALERIANO's forces, in order to appear as having been driven from its own area into that of the Huks whom were trying to infiltrate. Their cover story was bought, and for four fraternized with the local: Huks (even came close to obtaining an interview with the Huk supreme commander), and learned their entire modus operandi, the identity of their leaders, their supply sources, and the civilian govern- ment officials who were secretly collaborating with them: On the fifth the fact that the men had more ammunition than did the ordinary Huk guerrilla- L the one flaw in the preparations- seemed to have aroused the local commander s suspicions Force X thereupon decided to strike,and, within half an hour; had deactivated two Huk squadrons, its guerrilla members either killed or seriously wounded: Immediately afterward, two uniformed companies Upon quick Very they squad they days they day, 48 COUNTERINSURGENCY : A SYMPOSIUM moved in and screened the local inhabitants for two weeks The impact of this operation was such that; whenever thereafter two Huk squads met, did not trust each other: However, similar experiments by other commanders were less successful because planning and preparation had not been detailed and thorough enough: Nothing on s0 elaborate a scale was ever tried in said COL. WHITE; but CAPT: JEAPES had successfully dressed up his only Chinese corporal in CT clothes and sent him out among the terrorists, who were taken in by him; and in Kenya the British commander COL. KITSON* had been most successful in disguising some of his men as Africans to sOw confusion among the Mau Mau who did not know each other: COL. VALERIANO recalled another use of disguise, in which he staged sham battles in front of local villagers between uniformed forces and some of his men dressed in Huk clothes After tying them up and manhandling them a little, the soldiers would turn the pseudo-Huks over to the police for safekeeping (that is, ostensibly, to prevent them from rejoining the enemy) When they finally came out of prison, the men had a great deal of information and sometimes told stories of entire villages collaborating with the Huks A related device; not involving disguise, was to kidnap peaceful farmers and hold them for & while, waiting to see whether their absence would be reported: When, after five Or SO, the chief of police Or the mayor still had not reported these disappearances to the army authorities, it was a safe guess that these local officials were on the side of the guerrillas On the subject of an effective alert system, COL. GALULA described the one in use in Algeria, where the French maintained a single VHF channel for emer- gencies, with a monitoring receivet; and every large post, regiment; battalion, and even military planes would be on that emergency channel. With a ready reserve unit at division level, reinforcements could be brought [O any trouble spot by helicopter within half an hour, and support planes could take off at one minute's notice: In answer to a question from MR. RUTKOWSKI, COL. GALULA said that security for the channel was never a problem; the FLN did not succeed in swamp- the French with emergency calls, for they failed to capture the. necessary number of transmitters and lacked the batteries and spare tubes with which to maintain those they did get: Turning to the of the control of arms and other equipment, MR HOS- MER asked what techniques the participants had employed or encountered for COL KITSON attended the sessions of the Symposium on Friday, April 20, 1962. they Malaya, days ing subject TACTICS OF COUNTERGUERRILLA WARFARE (II) 49 limiting the supply of arms to the guerrilla side (aside from border control and other methods already discussed) COL. VALERIANO described the system used successfully in the Philippines: an attractive price scale for arms voluntarily surrendered, which brought in a food of weapons of all sorts; strict control over firearms issued to licensed holders; and severe penalties (up to ten years' imprisonment) for people using arms without license. Many weapons, nevertheless, remained in the hands of subversives, who in the beginning were able to needed ammunition from the citizens. In the last three years of the Huk campaign, however, lacked ammunition in sufficient quantity. As an example of the price scale, COL BOHANNAN mentioned 70 to 100 pesos (or U.S. $30 to $50) for a rifle (up to 200 pesos if it was in very good condition) Personally, he was against the program, for he would have preferred arming the citizenry. Also, a great many unserviceable arms had to be for with money that could more profitably have gone into replacements and spare parts, of which there was a shortage He thought more highly of the usefulness of ammunition control: This was achieved in part by impfoving the discipline of one's own troops sO a5 to cut down on sales of ammunition by the men. One very successful trick Was to let the soldiers sell ammunition that; when fired,killed the man shooting When that happened, the entire enemy company, not koowing whether the mishap was due to gun O ammunition, would get gun-shy' and valuable time taking apart the gun as well as the ammunition. If suspected the latter, they might angrily go in search of the man who had sold it to them, and get caught that way- COL. WHITE described the system in Malaya, similaf to that in the Philippines, whereby the British the equivalent of U.S. $330 for a Bren gun and about 35 cents for individual rounds of ammunition, and exercised tight control over weapon-holders: At first; the Chinese terrorists were able to take the weapons issued to the civilians whom the British were training to defend the villages; later; the held on to them Soldiers, on the other hand; never gave up their weapons, knowing they would be court-martialed if did Even single rounds, CAPT. JEAPES pointed out, had to be accounted for; if they were accidentally dropped, the fine might be up to a month's pay. In the case of a lost magazine, it would be much higher,and a report would go to general headquarters The village home guard also had relatively few losses, knowing that; if lost a gun, would be told to g0 on patrol without a weapon: were deliberately equipped with shotguns in the (mistaken) assumption that, if lost, it was the least valuable weapon. COL. BOHANNAN commented that so figid a system of controls buy they paid spend they paid people they they they Also, they 50 COUNTERINSURGENCY : A SY MPOSIUM would be difficult to impose on an independent army suchas the Philippine forces In answer to a question from MR. RUTKOWSKI a5 to how easy it would be to introduce certain devices into the bandit forces by way of arms and ammunition, COL. WHITE thought this would not be difficult; and COL_ FERTIG related his own experience in the Philippines, where the native counterguerrillas in the service of the Japanese received virtually no ammunition from the Japanese and would eagerly pick up anything they found lying around, providing the guerrilla with & good opportunity for introducing devices that would incapacitate the user: CAPT: JEAPES and COL. BOHANNAN thought it more important to deprive the enemy of food than of weapons, as the guerrilla can survive without a gun but not without food. (COL. FERTIG qualifed this last statement: The guerrilla must have arms at least at the outset; Or else;, as in the Philippines, receive them soon there- after through outside assistance, if there is to be a movement at all) It was generally granted that in certain countries, including Vietnam, it would be impossible to cut off the enemys food supply (COL. BRUNDAGE thought that it would be feasible in certain sections of Vietnam), and that; in general, a guerrilla who is completely cut off from the outside can survive for a considerable time, though with obvious hardships The FLN, COL. GALULA reported, received no weapon shipments from outside Algeria after 1958 and at the end of the war was down to about 6500 weapons. But even if you succeed in drying up the guerrilla's stock of firearms, said CAPT: JEAPES, you have not necessarily incapacitated him; he may resort to knives and still more primitive weapons before he surrenders On the subject of surface logistics, MR: HOSMER asked CAPT. JEAPES whether weight had been a major factor in long-range, deep-penetration operations CAPT: JEAPES: The men in the SAS trained for it very hard and still do. The most ever Carried in was a 90-pound knapsack, containing two weeks" rations. They did not expect t0 fight with that: Rather, would dump it in the area of operations and from it only a very light load (containing little more than three days' rations and a hammock) with which to do the actual fighting Much time and thought went into working out the lightest rations Rice was the main staple, as it was with the CTs,but the British also needed tea Even heavy Western eaters learned to subsist on very little if had to carry it A typical diet would be a breakfast of nothing but tea; a mid-day of tea, cheese, and biscuits; and an evening meal of curried meat, rice, tea, biscuits, and perhaps a piece of chocolate: American hammocks, and even the British net hammocks, were found tOo heavy, and the men preferred to make their own from parachute silk, just as improvised a substitute for the heavy British poncho. They carried only one spare they they pack they snack they TACTICS OF COUNTERGUERRILLA WARFARE (II) 51 set of clothes, into which changed each night Not expecting engage- ments, brought with them three magazines (sixty rounds) of ammunition There-would also be two wireless sets that worked on continuous wave. Battery- operated, similar to the 109 set; with a range of 250 miles that was good for most purposes, these could be carried by one man: Where greater range was needed, a larger' and heavier continuous wave set with a hand generator was taken in unpopular with the men, however, because of the strain of carrying and cranking Apropos of the hammocks mentioned, COL WHITE added his own view that; except in the jungle to which CAPT. JEAPES Was referring, where there was no danger of enemy attack during hours of darkness, hammocks were treacherously difficult to get out of in a sudden attack (especially the American jungle hammock that needed only to be tipped over to make the occupant defenseless), and he had therefore never permitted them to be used in Malaya Regarding land vehicles and their characteristics, MR HOSMER asked whether present-day operational requirements could be met from available equipment, properly modified: Generally speaking, COL WHITE (supported by CAPT: JEAPES) thought it best to make do with existing, conventional vehicles and tO avoid becoming over- specialized and overorganized: COL. FERTIG singled out the recently developed 'tote goat' as particularly useful in difficult mountain terrain. This vehicle, which is commonly and most successfully being used nowadays by hunters in the high country of Colorado, resembles a small scooter with two wide wheels and 4-inch tires, and is able to do 7 to 8 miles per hour in low gear at about 23 miles to the gallon: It is cheap in maintenance costs and capable of climbing slopes, carrying both a man and his equipment; where even a horse would not do. COL GALULA spoke of the need for amphibious carriers in some countries (especially Indochina), causing CAPT. JEAPES t0 wonder the Americans could not take care of that need with helicopters, which thus far were being used mainly for transport Helicopters, COL. WHITE added, would none of the gas and maintenance problems of land vehicles COL. FERTIG mentioned the "Hover craft (SRI) as able to move across a man'$ 0 very rapidly to tfap him And COL VALERIANO had found the weasels;' which moved crisscross fashion, particularly in swampy and generally watery areas (they later were used to push roadbeds forward); native-made sleds, too,could heavy loads crOss-country and had the advantage of requiring no personnel training Of maintenance In COL BRUNDAGE'$ view, there were enough vehicles available today for use in those countries with open terrain or road networks, dry they big they deep pack why have path good pull 52 COUNTERINSURGENCY : A' SYMPOSIUM but he felt the need remained for good land vehicles with cross-country capability As for river vehicles, the consensus was that no craft was universally usable, and that shallow water and weeds around propellers continued to pose the major problems: MR HOSMER then went into the subject of air and air-ground tactics and tech- niques, with a question about the efficacy of aircraft in counterinsurgency for other than transport use. COL GALULA regarded planes as invaluable for the fast support of ground troops, provided you have a good alert system and have trained people on the ground to co-operate with the plane crews The French in Algeria attached planes (T-6's and T-28's, Sky Raiders, and the Mistral an obsolete but good jet fighter similar to the Vampire) to companies, sometimes even to platoons; drill and train- with well-organized channels between the people needing and those control- the planes, yielded excellent results The French also used Piper Cubs over roads to protect convoys, and helicopters with the SS-1l guided missile against targets that were difficult to reach otherwise: CAPT JEAPES agreed as t0 the principle of air suppOrt for ground troops A small patrol, for example, can around and find targets, such as caves, that can be discovered only by the foot soldiers, and then call in a jet armed with rockets But he preferred a system by which support planes were pooled and assigned as needed rather than permanently attached to a battalion Of company: COL. BOHANNAN outlined an arrangement that he had found most efficient and adequate; it involved permanent assignment to a battalion of five aircraft (L-S's and L-19's), five pilots, five maintenance men, etc. These planes, COL. VALERIANO explained, were not fighters but work horses, which checked on patrols, picked up messages from the ground, and dropped supplies 7 enough, in one instance, to maintain two battalions in the mountains for seven weeks COL GALULA granted the advantages of the system just described SO long as aircraft was plentiful, but he wondered how it would operate where a limited number of available planes called for decisions on priorities During World War II in the Philippines, COL. FERTIG feported, the Marine Aviation Corps had been called in for fighter suppOrt and had been guided to the targets by L-S's; though quite outside the rules, this arrangement had worked out well. The participants were agreed on the effectiveness of aircraft in counter- insurgency. Planes will slow down the guerrilla even after he gets used to them; said COL. GALULA, and the Sky Raider will do it most effectively; COL. FERTIG believed the psychological impact of airplanes on the guerrilla to be tremendous, ing, ling dig TACTICS OF COUNTERGUERRILLA WARFARE (II) 53 as was shown, for example, in a case where troops that were safely in by the sea irrationally came out of their dugouts when enemy planes few over them; and in COL: BOHANNAN' s experience, the Japanese were particularly frightened of the L-S, which, though not a fighter; often heralded artillery shelling COL WHITE described the tactical use of aircraft in Malaya, where light planes of the L-l9 type had been very effective in a number f functions: for emergency supply to small patrols; for the firing of artillery; fof reconnais- sance; and for set operations against a known enemy camp. In COL. WHITE' $ experi- ence (which was confirmed by CAPT. JEAPES), & trained pilot acquired the faculcy of seeing what was in the jungle, especially on early morning reconnaissance flights, and could thus become a valuable source of information As to the ideal level of control, it should be no lower than the brigade to ensure maximum use of the plane. # With respect to aircraft used as fighter support; COL. WHITE saw little difference between conventional and guerrilla warfare, with the problem of troop and target identification still a very difficult one. He described an experiment by which British troops in tropical areas had been successful in devising a code of differently colored balloons to identify their own positions and strength: In answer t0 a question from MR. HOSMER about the desirability of having one patrol and become thoroughly familiar with a single area, COL WHITE pre- ferred a more flexible system by which a group of pilots would be assigned to tak- turns in a number of patrol areas, So that within three to six months each man would be fully acquainted with all of them and able to handle any part of the larger territory: COL GALULA commented briefly on the possibilities - largely unexplored so far_for airplanes in gas warfare: The French originally developed a gadget that could spread tear gas over & sizable area but forced the planes themselves to too high They discarded it in favor of helicopters, but these have not: as yet been used in the field. For obvious psychological reasons, gas spread by air was never used for riot control in the cities. Moreover; its effects are s0 short-lived that it can be successfully used only where very quick follow-up action is possible Returning to the role of aircraft in reconnaissance, MR RUTKOWSKI wondered whether: planes had any effective function during the night; admittedly the best time for patrol and reconnaissance in counterinsurgency: COL. FERTIG reported some surprising results in spotting the upturned faces of people on the ground *A seeming difference of opinion as tO wherher the planes ought to be controlled at brigade o5 at bartalion level was partly explained by the slighf difference berween the American and the British conception of the brigade. In the rypical American setup, the brigade is largely & coordinaring unic; for the British, who are usually more hard-pressed for forces, planes, and equipment; it has t0 perform a more acrive part dug drops pilot ing using Ay 54 COUNTERINSURGENCY : A SYMPOSIUM when you flew over them at night, especially as it is instinctive for men to look up at a passing COL VALERIANO had found the LS's very useful at night, at the height of the Huk campaign, when the Communists wece strong enough to attack towns in Central Luzon and the counterguerrillas lacked reliable communications between their bases and the towns He had an L5 in the air at all times, and as soon as it spotted a fire (the Huks were using arson), planes would go to work on the area, dropping flares and discouraging the movement of Huk forces COL. GALULA described the successful protection of the border barrages by planes flying constantly back and forth and dropping fares to the guerrilla fcom moving: (He did not think, in answer to a question from CAPT: JEAPES, that the use of flares had affected the night vision of his own troops) MR HOSMER nOw raised the subject of air logistics, inquiring especially into the merits of helicopters, and the needed characteristics (silence, etc ) of transport aircraft It was agreed that surprise was very difficult to preserve in air operations COL GALULA suggested that, having inevitably given away the fact that troops Of supplies are on their way, you could try, by mock landings oc erratic flight patterns, to confuse the enemy as t0 their actual destination. Better still, if you can afford the planes, thought COL. BOHANNAN, is tQ aifcraft in the air So much of the time that the guerrilla side becomes saturated with more reports than it can pOS- sibly sift Out CAPT: JEAPES, 0n the other hand, stressed the desirability of main- taining secrecy whenever possible; supplies to cut-off troops, in particular, should be carried in by men on foot rather than dropped. In the jungle operations of the SAS; the troops always started out with two weeks' rations, heavy though these were to carry, just to avoid having to be air-supplied and thus run the danger of revealing their position: COL. WHITE admitted that the man-pack was desirable for small operations, but regarded helicopters O planes as the only alternative for or man drops in large-scale operations COL BOHANNAN was inclined t0 make an even stronger case for the logistic uses of aircraft He felt that the potential of air which are economical in manpower and money, had not been fully enough exploited; by the relatively simple device of keeping & few planes, perhaps no more than tWO, continually buzzing back and forth over an area, you could camouflage your movements well enough to use air extensively without endangering youf security. COL WHITE concurred; he quarreled with the theory, taught by the warfare schools, that air suppOrt is a bonus, and advocated air supply as & routine means of suppOrt wherever other vehicles are unusable. plane. kept keep keep supplies drops, drops special TACTICS OF COUNTERGUERRILLA WARFARE (II) 55 As for the free-drop versus the parachute technique, CAPT: JEAPES favored the latter, having found the free-dtop not sufficiently accurate as well as a hazard to the ground troops COL. VALERIANO disagreed, recalling that he had once laid out an entire air strip in the middle of & mountain range using free-drop supplies in connection with helicopters; once the troops had been moved out of the way, he {_ had found the free-drop method safe and accurate ("we could free-drop fresh eggs") There was general agreement on the psychological value of air support in its effect on both the enemy and the counterguerrillas. COL VALERIANO cited the case of an important Huk personage who allowed himself to be captured in the moun- tains' He had been demoralized, and led to believe that his Cause was lost; by the sight of supplies being dropped to the government forces while he and his men were starving He was released on condition that he go back and persuade his followers to surrender; as indeed did. COL WHITE stressed the importance for the morale of your own troops of 'letting the men know that; when they are sick or wounded, & helicopter will fetch them: COL WHITE ended the afternoon's discussion with the more general observa- tion that all the methods and techniques mentioned by the participants in the pre- ceding two hinged on finding the right leaders and placing them in positions where could do the most good. This applies, he said, not Only to the leader- ship of your own military forces, but also to the police, the intelligentsia, and the administration of the country in which you are operating It took the first three months of his assignment to Malaya, and a series of initial failures, for him to recognize this principle and to begin to operate on it with success they days they APRIL 18, 1962,AM.* PRINCIPLES AND TECHNIQUES OF POLITICAL ACTION Gearing tbe Aim 0f tbe Counterinsurgent to tbe Objective of tbe Insurgent Co-ordi- nating Political and Psycbological Ends A Step-by-step Prescription for Wresting Political Control from tbe Insurgent: Screening tbe Population; Identifying Potential Supporters; Selecting Cadres; Organizing an Indigenous Political Leadersbip; Subporting Eacb Step by "Strategic" and "Tactical" Propaganda Tbree Requisites for Success: A Firm Ideological Base; Resolute Counterinsurgent Leadersbip, and Expert Knowledge of Revolutionary Warfare Subordinating Military t0 Civilian Autbority Wberever Possible: How Tbis Policy Succeeded in Malaya and tbe Pbilipbines, and Wby Cbildren as a Source of_ Intelligence: Etbical Barriers to Tbeir Exploitation; tbe Incidental Rewards of Kindness Recognizing tbe Turn of tbe Tide: Tbe Psycbological Moment To Convince tbe Enemy Tbat He Is Losing Progressing from tbe Easy to tbe More Diffcult Victory: Tbe Case for Small Test Areas of Demonstrably Successful Operations The Weight of Economic, Political, and Etbnic Factors in Counterinsurgent Plan- Retaining Or Seizing tbe Initiative in Selecting Areas for Military and Political Effort: "A Bad Plan Is Better Tban No Plan" MR HOSMER announced the topic for the days discussion ("principles and tech- niques of political operation, psychological warfare, and civic action") and invited the participants' comments on the first point o the agenda, "fundamental ciples to be followed in political action: GEN. LANSDALE felt that this question had to be approached from the view- of counterinsurgency as it related to insurgency. The basic situation being one in which the guerrilla side is essentially out to capture the population, and territory is captured in the process, the chief operating principle of the counter- insurgents must be to formulate aims and devise methods that will win the people to their side. Our side is conspicuously weak in the definition of this objective and #Present: Col. Bohannan, Mr: Ellis, Col Fertig, Col.

White. 56 ning prin- point PRINCIPLES OF POLITICAL ACTION 57 in the productive cO-ordination of political and psychological ends. Western political leaders are inclined to deal in concepts that seem imprecise to those on the local foreign scene, and the stress at Other echelons is often too much on mechanics and technical application: Thus, diplomats tend to think in terms 0f negotiating a modus vivendi (that is to say, in terms of compromise); the people below them, in terms of political structure; the psychologists, only in terms of the communications media In Vientiane, for example, GEN. LANSDALE had once met with several representatives of various nationalities who were actively at work on the psychological aspects of the Laotian situation and had started a newspaper and a radio station Yet when asked by him wby they were this work,not one had a realistic answer: Whenever we have faced a communist enemy, his side ~ thanks to the concerted effort of a handful of experienced people-has had a precisely objective, a timetable, and patience: The answer tO our problem, GEN: LANSDALE suggested, may be fof each one who has a function in the total picture to inject the necessary wisdom and purpose within his own small area of jurisdic- tion and activity. COL. GALULA' $ experience completely confirmed GEN. LANSDALE' $ remarks On being sent to Algeria in 1956,he and his fellow commanders were told simply to 'pacify;' on the assumption that one could win the population to one's side just by being kind The mistakes that were made in those early days, in spite of dedi- cation and manpower; were due partly to ignorance of the principles and methods demanded by modern guerrilla warfare COL. GALULA then outlined at some length his own theories, principles, and procedures- proved by his experience in China, Greece, Indochina, and Algeria _ which he regarded as generally relevant and applicable to all guerrilla warfare situations Communist techniques, he believes, derive from the realization that in any situation, whatever the cause, a small minority is actively for the cause, another small minority is actively against it, and the large majority is undecided and uncom- mitted. By that same 'golden rule" the counterinsurgent side, in turn,must make it its first task to identify those who are already for it and then persuade them to work on the passive majority with a view to winning it over. Obviously, the better your cause; and the larger the share of the population that is actively on your side, the easier it will be to neutralize or eliminate the opposition The initial situation determines the methods by which to identify the sympathetic minority If the insurgents have established control, people are not likely to come forward immedi- ately and reveal themselves, and it will require pressure and force before they do. doing stated ample 58 COUNTERINSURGENCY : A SYMPOSIUM The next step is to choose among those who are for you those who are This screening can be accomplished by setring potential leaders tasks of increasing difficulty: In the selection of cadres it is well, once again; to look at the very efficient methods of the Communists and their imitators. In Algeria, for example, the rebels found an issue, managed to attract & small corps, and used this to influ- ence and win a larger corps They then divided Algeria into sixareas,each organized and controlled by its own boss, in whom was vested the all-important function of collecting money, and who, in turn, subdivided his area down to the village level, choosing his cadres upon careful observation of who contributed and who did not Once such cadres have been formed, furnish the initial guerrilla forces, and the fest follows An example of the communist principle that organized cadres must pave the way for military action was furnished in China in 1949, when the Chinese Commu- nists, on reaching the Yangtze River, stopped for five or six months, ostensibly to (( 'negotiate' with the National government, but actually to organize and train the political cadres that still lacked in the south before moving in their trOOpS to take control there Then, having deluded the Nationalist side to the where it actually sent teams of negotiators, they suddenly crossed the river and did not stop again until reached the border: The case of China also illustrates the Communists method, once are militarily in control of an area, of creating an "issue" that will permit them to rally followers who Can then aid in the political conquest of the population: 'Land reform;' by which every Chinese farmer was to receive a piece of land of his own, was just such an issue An obviously attractive goal, it was attainable only by con- fiscating the property of 'rich landowners;' who initially were arbitrarily defined as people with more than one acre 0f land. For certain villages, however, which turned out to be already so divided up that no farmer qualified by that definition, the Communists simply changed the criterion of wealth to half an acre (in some cases even less) , in order to preserve the issue that would separate the supporters from the hostile and indifferent On the counterinsurgent side, tOo, all military and psychological action must be geared to finding cadres Whereas orthodox warfare requires only two men on the army staff ~a chief of operational planning and a chief of logistics- in revolu- tionary warfare you need a third, namely, the man who can say, at the time an operational idea is first conceived and before the operation is planned, this operation is useless in terms of your objective of winning the population; but that one, which seems militarily stupid, is excellent from the political of view" good. they they point they they point PRINCIPLES OF POLITICAL ACTION 59 Ideally, this third function, being essentially political, should not be the job of the military; but of necessity it must be, because only the army has the needed reservoir of manpower: It should be integrated with the armys established respon- sibilities throughout the counterinsurgent effort of conquest and control in a well-defined "SOP" Thus, the six successive steps in the full application of a counterguerrilla doctrine are 1. Expelling the enemys armed forces from a chosen area 2. Assigning small selected units to work with the population: 3. Eliminating those elements that actively support the enemy: 4. Finding a group of potential leaders 5. Selecting the ultimate leaders from among them: 6. Organizing these leaders into a political party: None of these steps may be omitted, though at times it will be possible to g0 rapidly from one to the next: Passage from one phase t0 another, as difficult for the counterinsurgent as for the insurgent side, requires much imagination and astute leadership. Moreover, the units needed to accomplish the first step, being militarily oriented, do not necessarily lend themselves to the primarily political tasks involved in the subsequent phases (just as people who think largely in terms of psychological action are apt to ignore military factors) One possible way of solving the problem is to screen units of soldiers to find among them those with a political orientation and aptitude and then assign these to the task that is para- mount once an area has been physically conquered: As regards the counterinsurgents' accompanying propaganda effort, one may {( distinguish, first of all, between 'strategic propaganda" (designed to show that the [( defender's cause is good and that his position is strong) and 'tactical propaganda' (geared to each of the above six steps and an essential weapon in its achievement) To name just one example of a tactical propaganda in the first step (expulsion of the guerrillas' armed forces from a chosen area) , the enemy, on being told that the counterinsurgents are about to clear that sector, has a choice between leaving it and accepting a fight Since the defenders interest lies in the latter alternative, his propaganda must be aimed at forcing the rebels to fight rather than to disappear: Apart from propaganda directed at the enemy himself,the first step must be accom- panied also by an appeal to the native population, which should be, essentially, only this: "There will be military engagements; try to stay neutral!" For neutrality is all that is needed in the military phase of the war: And, finally, there isthe prop- 4 aganda Iine to be taken with the counterinsurgent troops, namely, to 'avoid aim, 60 COUNTERINSURGENCY : A SYMPOSIUM any action (such as the shelling of villages) that will antagonize the populace:" GEN. LANSDALE pointed out that psychological warfare is meaningless without a forceful, positive ideological base from which to combat and surpass the dynamic ideas of the communist side, supported as are by every known trick of propa- ganda: Against those communist beliefs, rooted in nineteenth-century philosophy, we should at least pit Our Own ideals, rooted in eighteenth-century philosophical concepts, to show that we are for something and not just fighting a negative, defen- sive battle Those whose support we are seeking must have reason to feel that are being asked to risk their lives for something worth while The example of Malaya demonstrates the crucial importance of a wise political goal, and a practice consistent with it, in the achievement of military victory: By the same token, "liberte, egalite, fraternite;" if practiced as professed in Indochina, might well have changed the outcome of the French-Vietminh war: Moreover, everyone who has had a command position in a counterguerrilla campaign knows that there are always some men among his troops who attract support from the population simply because believe in a ideal that can communicate to others and that the people can share. The ideals and beliefs of such natural leaders are worth heeding; they might well become part of the ideo- logical base of the counterinsurgent side. And, COL: GALULA added_ whenever such a natural leader emerges, he ought to be given the widest possible powers, in violation, if necessary, of established military tradition and without feference to his formal education. To do S0, however, requires the kind of flexibility that distinguishes the communist side but which, unfortunately, conflicts with conven- tional concepts of Western armies and governments COL BOHANNAN reiterated with approval GEN. LANSDALE'$ point about the importance of a national objective and about the need for people at the working level t0 carry it out On a small scale; he stressed the additional requirement that, from the top to the bottom level,all actions be at all times clearly in pursuit of the national objective, lest the enemy find abuses of the principle and thus an oppor- tunicy for saying, "They are just talking, but you can see that they don't mean it' Even more indispensable a psychological factof, COL. GALULA thought; was the absolute, unwavering determination of the top leaders He cited Hungary as an example of a war that had been won by counterinsurgents through firm resolution even though their cause was bad, and Indochina as an illustration of a good cause that failed for lack of determined leadership. COL BOHANNAN would not go quite so far Batista' s defeat in Cuba and Chiang's in China, he suggested, tended to prove that resolute leadership was not they they they they great PRINCIPLES OF POLITICAL ACTION 61 enough; and the nationalistic aspirations of the Vietminh, unobjectionable as appeared at first glance, probably had influenced the developments in Indochina almost as much as had the irresolution of the French: Without agreeing, therefore, that 'resolution at the top' was any more important than either an understanding of revolutionary warfare or a wise political goal, he was prepared to grant that all three elements were necessary to successful counterinsurgency- COL. WHITE, on being asked whether and to what extent the foregoing remarks to the case of Malaya, stressed the relative simplicity of the problem there (as compared to the areas with which the earlier speakers had been concerned), thanks largely to the background of British rule and organization, a loyal police force, and the established policy that self-government would be granted as soon as possible: As military commander, COL WHITE was merely in aid of the civil powers This meant, in practice, that he took no action without the approval of the District Officer (a Malayan), the Police Chief (an Indian), and the Special Intelligence Officer (a Chinese) On the other hand, certain moves, even though none of these men might object t0 them; were ruled out by COL. WHITE himself as too likely to antagonize the population: In the end, it was the consistent show of reasonableness that won over the people of Malaya, and the problem was still easier once the country became self-governing COL VALERIANO described very similar principles and results in his own experience in the Philippines. In Huk territory the civilian authoricy occasionally broke down to the point where the field commander had t0 take over many of the functions of civilian government officials But; in general, the military authorities did their utmost to defer to the civilian power: They built up the prestige of the provincial governor (whether liked him O not) by parading their support of him in public They ultimately convinced the people that because of the guerrillas the military was necessary and that the troops were acting as a police force: With the emergence of Magsaysay, who consistently stressed the close working relationship between military officers and local civilian representatives, the task became easier. Field staffs had a civil affairs officer; a most uSeful man, who not only provided Iiaison with the civilian authorities but was able tO contribute the civilian viewpoint to the planning of operations, often speaking up spontaneously and effectively against a proposal at the time it was made, without first having to consult the provincial government about it: For example, he was the only one likely to remember that a projected operation coincided with the harvest season, and to point out the slight tactical returns it would yield as compared with the greater value of allowing the locals to bring in their rice they applied they 62 COUNTERINSURGENCY: A SYMPOSIUM The Philippine campaign, GEN: LANSDALE added, was an example of a com- plex situation in which the political objective was essentially very simple. Because faith in constitutional government had broken down aS a result of fraudu- lent elections, it could not be restored by the electoral process until the ballot box itself was restored and protected. To do this became the aim of Magsaysays policy and actions At the time Magsaysay took office, COL VALERIANO recalled,_ one year before the next elections, he realized how successfully the Communists were exploiting the popular anger over earlier, questionable elections, and he promptly announced the government's determination to ensure the fairness of the coming (1951) elections He then made the army responsible for guarding the ballot boxes and protecting voters against intimidation: Also, he put ROTC units into active service, highly motivated still in their 'teens, who were given arms, uniforms, and some training; and proved very effective in discouraging political groups in rural areas from repeating the fraudulent practices of earlier elections. When the votes were counted, the people, knowing that the elections cc had been 'clean;' knew also that the government was of their own choice, and the rug had thus been pulled out from under the communist propaganda Militarily, this political victory of the government was reflected in the number of people who overnight volunteered their services to Headquarters, presenting the government forces with more agents than they could possibly use (an experi- ence that COL. GALULA and COL. WHITE recognized as one that signaled the turn of the tide in their own theaters) Especially striking and of great practical value was the appearance at COL. VALERIANO's battalion headquarters, one week after the elections, of a mob of three thousand women, children,and able-bodied men- S simple, unarmed villagers who had been supplying the Huks with food and intel- ligence for nine years but had now come to surrender: After the effectively organized interrogation of the first hundred, the rest voluntarily submitted all information 0n the basic Huk supply system, as well as on the whole pattern of tax assessment and payment, for the entire area of settlements within the Huk Regional Command No 3. This long-wanted intelligence enabled COL VALERIANO to put the strongest of the commands permanently out of commission: Prompted by COL GALULA's statement that the Communists invariably aim for the support of the intellectuals and of the youth (and that, in order to must have at least the former firmly on their side), MR HOSMER asked COL. WHITE 4 to about his own 'campaign for the children. COL. WHITE acknowledged the important role that "children" ~a term under which he was including students up t0 about the age of twenty-fouf St have played popular boys win, they speak PRINCIPLES OF POLITICAL ACTION 63 in virtually every mob action. Children actually started the last riots in Singapore and thus brought the whole island under martial law. In Malaya the trOops spent much time and attention on the children and indeed made perhaps their most intimate impact on the adult population not by the punishment-and-reward system but through their friendship with the children ~ the pocketfuls of candy, the playgrounds and youth centers, the officers' attendance at school games at the invi- tation of the headmasters Although fully aware that the children were also spying on them; the troops had little difficulty establishing rapport, and COL WHITE $ outfit to this maintains three scholarships under which one Indian, one Malayan, and one Chinese child are being educated. GEN. LANSDALE recalled several incidents of the use of children in military conflicts: the Asturian miners who used children as messengers, and villagers in the 1955 pacification campaign in Vietnam who passed information.on through youngsters of kindergarten age On the assumption that their youth protected them against reprisals On a different plane was the profound impression that American soldiers at the turn of the century (when the U.S. Army was sent to the Philippines to pacify what were essentially guerrilla forces) made on the Filipino people simply by being kind to their children, feeding them sweets, and teaching them school Where precisely, GEN. LANSDALE implied, was one to draw the line between the benevolent; permissible use of children and their immoral exploitation? COL. GALULA had found himself temperamentally unsuited to organizing and exploiting children for the purpose of gathering intelligence through them: Fortunately, the enemy had not organized the children against him (if he had, it might have been necessary to react with the same tactic), and COL: GALULA felt free, therefore, to follow his own inclination, which was t0 leave the children out of the war; to provide educational and athletic facilities for them, and to accept gratefully any useful information might spontaneously offer: His area had seven schools, with a total of seven hundred children, who received there not only academic instruction but milk, food, and the opportunity for sports and games COL: GALULA granted, however, that even he would not hesitate to organize the children in any situation where the enemy was & foreign invader: This, of course, had been precisely the position of COL. FERTIG in the Philip- pines, where children were effectively enlisted for & variety of tasks in the struggle 0 against the Japanese Howevef, were not, strictly speaking, 'organized;" and their contribution was a gratuitous adjunct to intelligence work rather than part of the Moreover, were supposedly all volunteers, and they reported to the civil authorities rather than to the army. COL FERTIG fecalled that some day they they plan. they boys 64 COUNTERINSURGENCY : A SYMPOSIUM as young as ten had exhibited all the resourcefulness and leadership qualities that one might hope to find in an adult: Children, lightly armed, were commonly used as reporters to their fathers in the volunteer guard, and, in areas where it was impossible to maintain pOstS, also as runners In addition, they parti- cipated in the "bamboo telegraph" that operated without interruption through Japanese-occupied terrain for fifteen months before it was finally broken: The Japanese (in answer to a question from MR HOSMER) were unsuccessful in their attempts to cultivate the children, because of the same inconsistent; irrational behavior by which they alienated the adults By offering candy one and slaps the next; gradually frightened off possible recruits among the young This, despite the fact that in December 1941 the Americans and their allies had lost face so completely that for a long period thereafter the Japanese enjoyed the support of the population while the guerrillas had to start from scratch In the Huk campaign COL. VALERIANO had observed a similar development, and a comparable lack of wisdom on the part of the enemy. Once the government forces under Magsaysay began to show successes, the Huks abandoned their previous policy of friendliness toward the population in favor of the most blood- thirsty and ruthless tactics (they attacked hospitals and massacred civilians regard- less of age and sex), methods that permanently alienated the people and marked the beginning of a growing rapport between civilian youth and the army: One of the ways in which COL VALERIANO attracted the young was to invite provincial schools to stage tournaments on the basketball court at his headquarters, with refreshments served at the armys expense The enterprising intelligence officer made himself acquainted with the youngsters, discovered that several of them were the children of Huk commanders,and methodically obtained from them a fle of information not obtainable through ordinary intelligence channels These data included, for example, the fathers' birthdays or the expected arrival dates of new babies Y times, that is, when a Huk family man might be tempted to leave his mountain base for a short stay at home, thereby offering the government troops an opportunity for picking him up Turning to another aspect of the problem, MR HOSMER asked the group: "How, in the area of strategic psychological warfare, do you convince a people that you, rather than the guerrillas, are going to win?" COL GALULA once stressed as the crucial requirement a determined government and unwavering policy at the tOp. If the government hesitates O the policy changes, the local people are bound to be discouraged and the loyalist cause will suffer & setback of months and sometimes years, no matter how hard and well acted they day they again PRINCIPLES OF POLITICAL ACTION 65 the people in the field may be working The rebels' propaganda is sure to exploit any such weakness at the top: In Algeria, the FLN's line was simple: "The French proclaimed that were staying in Indochina, Tunisia, and Morocco forever, yet left; now say theyl remain in Algeria, but will out in the same way No words - not even such evidence as the heavy French investment in the country_could prevail against such a simple argument: And a cabinet change in Paris, with its attendant uncertainty about the future, would instantly wipe out any political benefits of recent military advances The FLN for its part; aware of this inter- action, was quick to deny any rumor about negotiations,for fear that their followers would equate talks with compromise and see in them a sign that their organization was crumbling This, tO COL. GALULA, Was just one manifestation of the fact that a revolutionary war calls for unyielding, extremist attitudes on both sides and leaves no room for the moderate middle: Thus, every attempt to form a 'third force" in Algeria failed, for only in postwar times can the liberal element emerge in numbers COL. VALERIANO had found no more dramatic and persuasive way of demon- strating that the guerrillas' was & losing cause than to let former Huks talk to the crowd about their experiences before and since their surrende:: Ifan ex-Huk could say, for example, that some of his compatriots in Mindanao were being helped by the army, that they had houses, animals, and tools and were doing scientific farm- ing, this kind of testimony made a powerful impression, for it gave the lie to the contention -central to the Huks' ideological appeal _ that Filipino farmers were landless tenants COL FERTIG agreed with the previous speakers that the decisive changes in a guerrilla war were made, or caused to happen, by the top leaders, but he pointed out that; from the moment the atmosphere changed in your favor, even events at the. grass roots could turn people from lukewarm into enthusiastic suppofters (Thus, & sudden strong sense that the anti-Japanese guerrillas were winning once caused surrenders of Japanese soldiers in Mindanao to rise from none to seventy in a single month, even though in surrendering those men were violating all their principles) The. crucial and most difficult however, is tO capture, and immediately exploit, the psychological moment at which people are ready to shift their faith and sympathy to your side GEN LANSDALE agreed that no simple gimmick O psychological measuring {4 device could help one detect that moment; to recognize and seize it required the wisdom of Solomon:" Moreover, the Western counterinsurgent is up against the they they they they pull thing, 66 COUNTERINSURGENCY: A SYMPOSIUM communist principle of mesmerizing the masses by the incessantly repeated assurance that ultimately and inevitably communism will win (even at times when it seems to be losing), a demagogical device foreign and unacceptable to members of a democratic society: To prevail against it; we must at all times be ready to back our words with actions, t0 give tangible proof of our determination to win. COL GALULA stressed, in addition, the importance of having & plan behind every show of strength: He recalled instances when such 2 show, lacking effective follow-up action, had boomeranged as the terrorist side could say: "Look at what had to bring in, and still they haven't managed to catch us In this connection, MR RUTKOWSKI reiterated the advice of an earlier speaker that it is well to choose and publicly identify & small, manageable area and then to clean it up, thereby convincing the natives that they are dealing with & purposeful and efficient government: This principle of the small test area within the larger one, COL WHITE pointed out, was followed in Malaya; and in 1955-1956, &s & glance at 2 military map for that period would show, "black" and "white" areas were intermixed as on a checkerboard COL. GALULA then described the extent t0 which the idea of the 'test area' had permeated the experimental theory of the Chinese Communists in .all its applications, permitting them to operate with and efficiency despite the vastness of the country. Thus, by a variety of criteria, they would choose areas at every level (for example, Manchuria as a whole; then a province outside Manchuria, and ultimately key villages throughout the country). The reason for the selection of one area might be that it was ideologically advanced; another would be chosen because it was backward; a third, because it was close to & city; and a fourth, because it had an ethnic minocity. Being thus representative of the variety and complexity of the country'$ problems, these were to serve as testing grounds for new ideas and institutions, but not until the proposed innova- tion had been subjected to a very thorough theoretical critique Typically, therefore, when the Politburo had decided that the time was ripe for a novel measure (such as the organization of semisocialist €O-operatives, for example), it would submit the idea to the Central Committee for discussion and possible improvement If the majority favored it; the idea would officially become "Project No. 1" and would thereupon be submitted, for compulsory discussion, to & vertical slice of the Party in the areas (that is, t0 a total of perhaps seven hundred people, from the head of the Communist Party in Manchuria down to the Party'$ representative in the small random settlements). Frank; critical dis- cussion would reveal new problems, sometimes to the point where the leadership they speed ~key key key big key PRINCIPLES OF. POLITICAL ACTION 67 decided to the idea entirely. More often, the proposal would be modified in the light of suggestions and criticism, labeled 'Project No. 2, and Jaunched experimentally in all areas: Communist leaders 'and observers from other areas would be invited to watch and afterward discuss the experiment Their feac- tions ' might cause the plan to be further modified in which case it became "Project No. 3"_or could lead to its abandonment even at this late stage Once approved, however; and in final form, the project would be released for implementation throughout the country, with the same cadres who had observed its experimental phase serving a5 advisors to local officials By the above method, COL GALULA had seen such formidable tasks as a country-wide census and the institution of a rationing system throughout China accomplished in a matter of one or two weeks The French, by contrast; were apt to launch an attractive idea blindly, without experimentation or consideration for the local situation (for example, their 1956 project for local self-government in Algeria, by which hoped tO improve the political system), and to find themselves compelled later to fevise it from the bottom up and at cost: MR HOSMER suggested that the Chinese Communists' approach to innova- tions, as described by COL GALULA, might well be adaptable to the present anti- communist struggle in South Vietnam: The idea, he thought; of selecting areas in which you can be certain of military victory, bringing them under con- trol, building them up from the governments of and using them foc purposes of demonstration promised to yield large returns In GEN. LANSDALE'$ view, MR. HOSMER had here touched on the true problem at the bottom of the discussion, namely, the fact that the Communists have been far more astute than their opponents in weighing all possible factors in an area, and making sure that conditions are favorable both to a military victory and to its political follow-up, before moving theic trOOps into that sector: will look at a situation locally in all its economic, political, and ethnic ramifications before deciding that a given military venture is worth risking COL_ GALULA cited the case of Burma as one where the Communists So far have chosen to an easy mili- tary victory which would require only one or two battalions_ because other, nonmilitary factors combine to make them regard Burma as a burden rather than an asset SO as it does not have a strong and tested Communist Party. MR TANHAM thought that the Americans in the past had made the mistake of not taking the initiative in the choice of areas, concentrating instead on hitting back where the Communists chose to attack To the extent that did select the areas of concentration, MR GREENE added, were inclined to overempha- drop key they they great 'key point view, They forgo long they they 68 COUNTERINSURGENCY : A SYMPOSIUM size the importance of consolidating control in remote parts, to the possible neglect of areas nearer the main cities. Another criticism (from COL. FERTIG) was that our military planners tend to treat counterinsurgency in the manner of fre fighters the bigger the conflagration, the faster they rush to its center Ltt and never think of starting at the brushfire end. There appeared to be general agreement as to the soundness of the approach recommended by MR RUTKOWSKI, which was tO divide the entire theater into many areas; to classify these according to how difficult it would be to establish control in each; then to begin with the easiest and work up from there; but always t0 reserve a few easy ones in case YOu suffer feverses and need an ace in the hole: The relative strategic or administrative value of a given territorial objective is 04 only of secondary importance; as GEN. LANSDALE put it, even a fesort area is fine if it is an easy victory.' In answer tO MR HOSMER'$ question as to what criteria the British used in selecting a particular 'black" (communist-controlled) area in Malaya for a clearing operation, COL WHITE listed such factors as enemy strength, tactical and logistic opportunities, and the response of the population: Also,since the guiding principle was, wherever possible, to isolate forces and followers of the enemy (who had & very ofganization) and to interrupt his courier system, certain areas were inevitably more desirable than others COL GALULA re-emphasized the importance of planning, quoting Mao Tse- tungs maxim that "a bad plan is better than no GEN. LANSDALE, in conclu- sion, suggested that those planning for the control of hostile areas would do well to heed a lesson that the Vietnamese forces learned in the course of reoccupying communist-held areas after the country' $ partition at the Seventeenth Parallel; discovered that even seasoned: Communists are vulnerable in their loyalty to the movement and susceptible, therefore, to a skillful psychological warfare approach; good plan ' they APRIL 18, 1962,PM.* PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE AND CIVIC ACTION "Strategic" as Distinct from "Tactical" Psycbological Warfare: Tbe Aims, Media, and Executants of Eacb Some Requisites for a Successful Psycbological Campaign zn Insurgent Territory: A Positive National Purpose Illustrated by Constructive Action; Ideals Comprebensible to tbe Local People; Deference to Native Mores; Fairness and Legality in Reward as in Punisbment Magsaysays Example of Personalized Govern- ment and Responsiveness t0 tbe Peoples Wisbes and Needs Tbe Britisb Conception and Practice in Malaya Tbe American Problem in Vietnam and Laos: Tbe Handi- cap of tbe Advisor; Instances of Blunder and of Success Steps in Winning Popular Support in Algeria: Healtb Stations; Scbools; Collective and Individual Propaganda The Role of Propaganda Media and Devices ("Gadgets and Gimmicks") in Demoralizing tbe Armed Insurgent and Infuencing His Active Supporters "Black" Propaganda Civil Action Programs in Vietnam and Laos Tbe Potential Role of tbe Local Offcial Advantages of Military over Civilian Direction for Civic Action Pro- grams Tbe Perennial Need for Ready Funds in AlL Pbases of Counterinsurgency Prisoner Rebabilitation Programs as a Psycbological Weapon MR HOSMER opened the meeting with the proposal that the treatment of psycho logical warfare and its supporting political operations be geared as much as possi- ble to detail and specific instances, with emphasis on techniques that members of the Symposium had tried and found particularly effective 66 By way of introduction, COL GALULA distinguished between 'strategic" {[ and 'tactical psychological warfare and between the levels at which each is exe- cuted. Strategic psychological warfare; in his definition, is planned at the theater level, in line with the policies and strategic goals that are formulated at the top; its chief media are radio, the press, films, and other means of communication directed at the population as a whole: The executants of tactical psychological #Present: Col.

White: 69 any 70 COUNTERINSURGENCY: A SYMPOSIUM warfare begin at the highest level that has direct contact with the population (in Algeria, this tended to be the company rather than the battalion commander) and continue down tO the lowest: Their task more difficult than the demands of strategic psychological warfare lies in varying media and techniques to suit the particular conditions at each of these lower echelons A tactical propaganda action, moreover, must be sustained if it is to be useful and effective; this became apparent in Algeria, for example, when the French experimented unsuccessfully with movie teams that moved from place to place As to how one demoralizes the guerrilla and convinces him that his cause is not worth fighting for, several of the participants saw possible answers in the lessons of the campaigns with which had been most closely associated. COL. BOHANNAN cecapitulated and amplified some of COL. VALERIANO's earlier analysis of the impact of Magsaysay's personality, policies, and methods on the Philippine situation (especially through the dramatic demonstration of the government's ability ad willingness to guarantee free elections in 1951), with the result that; within a year, the mood of the country changed from total distrust of the government to total contempt for the Huks The experience seemed to prove not as COL VALERIANO had already pointed out, the effectiveness of showing communist propaganda to have been wrong, but also the overwhelming appeal of a national policy that aims at stability in government and is concerned with the citizen's own aspirations, the rights of minorities, and other democratic freedoms Needless to say, for the policy to be fully convincing, the government must fit into it from top to bottom In the Philippines, unfortunately, the national objective was never clearly set forth in words, though the cause of Magsaysay and the government would doubtless have benefited . by a formal statement or document COL FERTIG, however, had an explanation for Magsaysay' $ failure to proclaim his aims officially: Magsaysay was not the head of the government but only its Secretary of Defense, and the kind of statement that would best have expressed his objectives and served his purposes could never have been condoned by the government because of the criticism of past policies that it would have implied MR PHILLIPS drew his illustration of a constructive approach from the situa- tion in South Vietnam in 1954-1955. It was summed up,he thought, in this answer of an American officer to a member of the Military Advisory Mission who had asked what he was supposed to do: 'Find out what the people want; and then we'll try tO help them get it" As was said at the beginning of the Symposium, any country that is under communist attack whether involved in actual guerrilla warfare Of they only, PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE AND CIVIC ACTION 71 in a political situation leading up to it_contains causes of dissatisfaction upon which the Communists are feeding: The anticommunist side, therefore, must dis- cover these causes and identify the issues with a view to satisfying the desires and aspirations of the people: In South Vietnam in the mid-fifties, for example, it became evident that the Communists had patented a simple issue 'independence' ~ and their propaganda was aimed at showing the Vietnamese government's domination by the French, its weakness and corruption, its lack of control over an untruscworthy army: (Some of these allegations had indeed not been entirely unjustified in the early 1950'*s.) Within less than two years after 1954,the Diem government succeeded in taking this issue away from the Communists by demonstrating its own independence and energetic leadership through & variety of actions, includingan effective pacification campaign and civic action (with tangible material benefits to the people), and, in general, by its efforts to restore order from chaos. Simultaneously with proving its own autonomy, the government provided increasing evidence of the Vietminh's domination from abroad. At the same time, it was becoming ever more apparent that the Communists were unable to fulfill their wartime promises of what would do for the country once there was peace. On local issues, tOo, communist propaganda was punccured little by little, and popular support dwindled accord- ingly: During the pacification campaign, for instance; when the troops moved in and neither stole nor but, on the contrary, were helpful to the civilians, this clearly proved communist propaganda to have been false,and helped to shake people's faith in the Vietminh still further: The guerrilla fighter or supporter himself; in COL GALULA'$ experience, is most quickly demoralized if he is cut off from the population through the process of systematic purging and becomes convinced that there is no hope for him To illustrate, COL GALULA fecalled the case of two civilian FLN members who, on learning that their village was about to be purged, fled to seek the support of the armed guerrillas just outside the area, but were told there that the villagers would have to fend for themselves. After remaining in hiding for a week, they joined another maquis, in a distant area, but became so demoralized as a result of the doubly discouraging experience of being abandoned the local guerrillas and separated from their own people that they surrendered. As for trying to find out what the people want MR PHILLIPS' prescription for a constructive pragmatic approach- Yt it is possible, COL GALULA thought, to guess wrongly or to too much emphasis on the lesser concerns out of una- wareness of, or inability to correct; the major ones. In the case of Algeria, the they raped by place 72 COUNTERINSURGENCY : A SYMPOSIUM leaders in Paris had a number of theories about the needs and wishes of the people, all of which turned out to be of secondary importance As those in the field found out, the Algerians wanted peace above all else and at any cost; they were indifferent to any other promises COL. FERTIG put the point even more strongly. The common man, particularly in Asia, is apolitical, interested only in his little world and his own needs, and impervious tO such abstract ideals as democracy and representative governmenc If the anticommunist forces in Vietnam have not been as successful as was the anti-Huk campaign in the Philippines, this has been due, in COL FERTIG'$ view, to Western failure to understand these Asian traits, and t0 the absence ofa national figure of anything like Magsaysay's dimensions Magsaysay, a unique leader; personalized government in a way not familiar to the Asian nations, made him- self available to any citizen who wanted to see and talk to him, covered the islands to theif remotest points (within four months of his taking office; all but perhaps 150,000 out of 2,000,000 islanders in the area of operations had seen him in action), listened to grievances, and took immediate action t0 remove their cause: In short, he demonstrated that the government was concerned with the people's needs and desires peace, food, land rather than with abstract concepts beyond their comprehension or with goals remote in time The average Asian,COL FERTIG believes, cannot cope with a period of waiting, for he lives only from to and anything not in the immediate future is to him tantamount tO infinity and therefore meaningless MR PHILLIPS disagreed with COL. FERTIG, believing his view to be an under- estimate of the Asian, who, while unable to understand the big issues, has some definite feelings about his basic rights and dislikes being ordered around, especially by outsiders He desires and understands a situation where, when he to sleep at night, he can expect to find his family well and safe in the morning; where the only dangers to be feared are from the elements, not from man. More- over; he is quite susceptible to the idea, which Magsaysay brought home s0 effec- tively to the Filipino people, that the government is really his servant: We ought to make our strongest appeal to him on this plane the promise of civil liberties, of equal justice impartially administered, and of the citizen's part in the govern- ment for this is where the Communists cannot compete with uS and are most vulnerable cOL BOHANNAN thought that COL. FERTIG, in generalizing about the Filipino, might indeed have underestimated somewhat the degree of political consciousness that had come with the country' s growth in the last fifteen years But he day day, typical goes rapid PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE AND CIVIC ACTION 73 agreed with COL FERTIG that the main difference between the Philippines then and Vietnam today in the nature of the leadership. A man with unique methods, Magsaysay devoted his energy, the power of his office, and his personal magnetism to offering the people a way of life that was patently better than the communist example and promise Vietnam has lacked a leader with his intensely personal and dramatic appeal, though its president has an equally strong purpose and probably greater intellectual capability. MR: PHILLIPS thought that this need not be the critical factor; if you did not have a national leader of Magsaysay' s stature, you could help develop local leaders To judge by the experience in Laos, the Asian will readily respond to a forceful local official whose efforts bring tangible results Several years ag0,for example,a police lieutenant in a village in Xieng Khouvang Province near the Vietnamese border, with very little material support from Vientiane, persuaded the villagers to take the initiative and provide the labof for a civic and road-building program of their own Under his guidance pooled their ideas, established priorities, and organized themselves for the effort; and the result was an impressive civic achievement, a cause of great pride to the villagers, and an example to neighboring communities: No idea emanating from and supported by the central government could have worked better: And in 1961 these villagers demonstrated great soli- darity and patriotism by putting up a desperate fight when Came under com- munist attack in the course of the Vietminh invasion Father Hoa, the militant Catholic priest in Binh Village (South Vietnam), is another example of how much a local leader can accomplish in Southeast Asia. MR HOSMER asked cOL. WHITE to comment on the approach in Malaya, where, it appeared, the information program had largely been directed at the noncom- munist population, and the psychological warfare program, at the terrorists The noncommunist inhabitant-the average tapper _ presented what COL WHITE called a fairly simple problem, for he cared little who ruled him so a5 he had peace and his rice Local officials the penghulus _ saw to it that the natives' rights were pfotected, and that, if the troops trampled down plantings, the military authority was informed and a complaint registered. Communication was easy and direct: COL WHITE would send his band to a village to play,and when everyone was assembled, there would be talks, with the pengbulus airing their problems and grievances, and a military representative explaining what the army was trying to do to help the Malayans and alleviate their hardships While every kind of tactical and strategic psychological warfare was used against the terrorists in the jungle, the very simple carrot-and-stick principle lay unique they they Hung typical long being 74 COUNTERINSURGENCY : A SYMPOSIUM was effective with the civilians. The nature of punishments and rewards had to be worked out with the aforementioned committee, which included the District Officer and the Chief of Police, that is to say, men who were in touch with the people: Punishments often had to be severe, and supervision close: Curfews were particularly painful and hence very effective Conversely, an extra hour O two added t0 the hours before the curfew by way of a reward went a long way toward making people happy and served as a valuable incentive to staying within the rules. Fairness was essential when using the stick Moreovet, it was preferable to have it used by the civil administrator rather than the military, thereby enhanc- the prestige of the former while dissociating the latter from an unpleasant function. Once the necessary control was established and the time had come to largely the carrot; one of the most effective ways in which to show trust in the local citizens was to let them form their own defense force COL. BOHANNAN observed that the relative simplicity of controlling and influencing the local population in Malaya was atypical and to be explained by the fortunate circumstance that the British were able to count on the loyalty of the civilian as well as the military government By contrast; in most countries faced with an indigenous revolt that an indigenous government is trying to suppress, a major problem is to make sure of the loyalty of government, police, and military, and then to convince each of them that the other two are loyal. To the extent that the problem existed in Malaya &t all,it was manageable, and the disloyal elements could be weeded out without political reservations In the Philippines, by com- parison, & bengbulu who was known to be playing ball with the Communists might also be a loyal supporter of the governof Or of still higher elected officials, and it would then be impossible to touch him because his votes were needed. In answer to MR. HOSMER's question on what it took to the confidence of the military, civilian, and police authorities and to create trust and co-operation among them, COL. WHITE summed up his own views and principles, which seemed to him valid not Only for Malaya but for most Asian societies that we were likely to be dealing with: In COL WHITE'$ experience, the man best equipped to accomplish the difficult and slow task of making people trust him and work with one another,and especially of persuading those of position and influence to do the he would have them is the one who in the foreign country aims for much the same moral standards as he would at home, who lives a clean life, is efficient, demonstrates trust in others, and has the peculiar faculty that makes people do things for him Or at his sugges- tion: If he has those qualities, if he makes sure that he is right in what he does and ing use gain things do, PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE AND CIVIC ACTION 75 proposes, and if he lives and talks with the natives and learns to understand them, he will their confidence Moreover, not only the commanding officer hinself but every : soldier around him must be imbued with these ideas and aims, must acquire a knowledge of Iocal customs, and, if possible, should be able to the language As an illustration of the importance that this last can assume, COL WHITE recalled that the Sultan in his area refused to receive him and his staff until were able to to him in Malayan: A final requirement; closely related to the respect for local customs, is the military commanders willingness to consult with local officials wherever possible rather than proceed immediately with actions, even sound ones, that are based only o his judgment COL. WHITE $ own experience in Malaya demonstrated to him both the fruit ful results of these methods and the negative returns you may expect from any policy ignoring them In his first three months; which were spent in a "black" area where many villagers were relatives and supporters of terrorists,the harsh methods he initially used ~t and quick, angry action when these methods failed to work proved quite useless; by contrast; the change to the more humane and considerate approach he adopted and consistently followed thereafter yielded immediate benefits in goodwill, cO-operation, and information freely offered MR. PHILLIPS, though in general agreement with COL. WHITE; pointed out that the Malayan situation was perhaps unique: The Americans, he thought; faced a somewhat more difficult problem in Vietnam and Laos because, being not in com- mand but only in the position of advisors, they had to do things by proxy: MR: PHILLIPS' observations in those two countries also had convinced him that one ill-advised deed by a single soldier can undo the of much thought- ful action; it fequires careful indoctrination of the military the men and often even the officers to instill in them the needed respect for the local civilians as well as a willingness to help these people in other than military ways He described the kind of psychological blunder that comes of failure to understand the essential mission The colonel in charge of a pacification operation had ordered a bridge that had been destroyed during the war to be rebuilt by the army engineer troops at great effort; in order to enable the civilians to carry their goods to market After the bridge had been opened, the colonel made an inspection and discovered the engineer officer-in-charge directing army vehicles across the bridge while order the civilians to make their way down the river bank, through the water, and up the other side, just as they had done before there was a bridge As for those whose function it is to initiate political and social change in & foreign country, are well advised to do so by indirection, by using their gain speak point speak they good ing they 76 COUNTERINSURGENCY: A SYMPOSIUM influence with the local citizens to persuade them to rid themselves of the wrong leaders and bring in the right ones, and to do so by elections, if possible, or by psychological means, rather than by direct; peremptory action. As a humorous illustration of this principle, MR PHILLIPS told of the stratagem by which COL VALERIANO dislodged the mayor in a village under his jurisdiction, a very adroit man, whom he knew to be a Huk sympathizer but who had strong political influ- ence in Manila to protect him COL VALERIANO'$ troops had stumbled on a com- munist patrol well outside the town and killed three of them: The next two of the dead were brought to a spot within earshot of the townspeople, and, after a mock ambush, whose fire was heard by everyone, their bodies were dragged to the center of town. When a large crowd had assembled and the mayor was about to inspect the bodies, COL VALERIANO stepped up and loudly thanked him for the information that led to the killing of these two men Hopelessly discredited in the eyes of the Communists, the mayor fled to Manila the next COL. FERTIG, returning once more to the importance of respecting local cus- toms and taboos, had seen it demonstrated by the Filipinos' reaction to Japanese indifference t0 their mores Looked up to by the people at first &s representatives Of a successful nation, the Japanese were too imbued with their own superiority to make allowances for local idiosyncrasies A few serious violations of the natives moral code were enough to change the climate of 'opinion within two weeks from the initial acceptance of the Japanese presence to such angry resentment that the week of September 15, 1942, saw a total of forty-five uprisings (Their particular affronts were to take the women by force and to the men.) The Communists, COL. GALULA cemarked, are fully aware of the advantages to be gained through conformance to native standards of conduct; and one of the eight "basic rules" that their soldiers are taught is never take orbuy anything from the without their consent; and when you get up in the morning, put back the door you have slept on The crucial importance that the Communists attach to this kind of preparation can be seen in the experience of a hard-pressed guer- rilla unit that appealed for reinforcements and was turned down with the explana- tion that the troops were not yet indoctrinated:" In COL. GALULA's experience, most communist soldiers lived scrupulously by those rules For example, when, during his captivity in China, the Communists decided to move him from a prison t0 private quarters in town,he was escorted by a soldier who knocked on the door of the house that was to be taken over fof the purpose, politely asked per- mission before entering, and declined the owner's friendly offer of even of hot water; though he must have been thirsty after his march: day day . slap people tea, PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE AND CIVIC ACTION 77 At the suggestion of MR. HOSMER, COL. GALULA then described in some detail the pattern he typically followed in Algeria once he had set up a unit in a the problems he encountered most frequently, and the successes that proved his methods valid. One of the first steps initiated immediately after a military post had been established was to open a frst-aid station, which was always badly needed because of the shortage of medics and the generally poor health conditions When the population failed to respond to an invitation to use the station, for fear of being seen making contact with the enemy, it Was necessary to resort to forced treatment Twice a week the battalion doctor would make a tour and give free consultations, with attention to the children; who were often the avenue by which to win over the adults: Another early step in establishing contact with the population was to open,Or re-open, schools In the area under COL. GALULA's jurisdiction, the only school with sixty places for a population of close to twenty thousand had been closed and then burned at the start of the rebellion Again, parents and children did not respond to the first request for attendance; but on being told that; as of a date, would be fined for their children's truancy, the parents decided to CO-operate. A third major task was to launch a propaganda campaign consisting of two different approaches One of these was to address people collectively and then try to draw as many of them as possible into a discussion (Typically, they listened willingly but would not talk:) The other was to reach them individually through a method of propaganda that required the co-operation of well-indoctrinated soldiers To this end, COL. GALULA would divide a village into sections, assign a to each; and instruct its members to accost individually any man met, discuss with him various topics, both general and local, and record his reaction. The soldiers notes proved surprisingly revealing, and, in usually no more than a week, it was possible t0 tell from them who was hostile; who was merely afraid, and who showed signs of co-operation: The main concern during a purge period was fear of hurting the innocent and missing some of the guilty. COL. GALULA followed the principle he had learned ffom the Chinese Communists of showing leniency to those who repented, and punishing all others The leniency policy, he found, large dividends, espe- cially as it the way for early self-government (the official policy of Paris) and predisposed people to vote of their own accord for the leaders whom COL. GALULA silently favored. After elections, with the co-operation of the new local village , special given they squad they paid paved 78 COUNTERINSURGENCY: A SYMPOSIUM authorities, it Was possible to use the carrot more and more: Collective punish- ment was avoided if possible, Or it was disguised (as,for example, in the announce- ment that a given meeting would not begin until the last man had arrived, which; in effect, meant punishing all others by making them wait) Money was of importance in consolidating control and winning the loyalty of the populace through civic action: COL. GALULA was aided in the success of his first pacifcation effort by the fact that the operation coincided with the new budget, and money was made available to him for a local project He there- upon had the newly elected mayor call in the municipal council to deliberate on possible uses for the appropriation When the council remained split between proponents of a well and those who preferred t0 spend the money on a highway that would permit trucks to reach the village (a third proposal, fof & new mosque, having had to be vetoed for reasons of policy), COL. GALULA suggested putting the problem before all the villagers, who then voted in favor of the well As the troops established control in an area in Algeria, taught the value of sanitation; people to clean their and showed them how to build latrines in their houses In one village, where no money was available for & much-needed school building and a request for funds had been met with a vague promise for the future, the enterprising mayor persuaded the municipal council that the village could build its own school by having every family donate one man- per . week of its equivalent in money: And with the aid of a little "black- market" money obtained by COL. GALULA, did indeed build a school in just that way ~ another illustration of MR PHILLIPS' about the potential contribu- tion of the exceptional local official. In other cases, where the mayor was weak of incompetent, COL GALULA was forced to work around and in spite of him, unless he could persuade the prefect to kick him upstairs. The discussion turned once more to the propaganda media, emphases, and devices that had been used successfully against the armed insurgents themselves COL. WHITE described his methods in Malaya as of the standard, straightforward kind. The dropping of leaflets containing picture stories (fof example, of terrorists coming in and being spotted and chased out) was a favorite device. Once the food- denial plan began to yield results, & newly captured prisonec was graphed in his emaciated condition, fed well for a few weeks, and photographed surrounded by his family and looking prosperous,and both pictures, properly annotated, were then printed side by side on the same leaflet and floated in terrorist terrain Family feeling was a vulnerable on which it was useful to play - ~as in pictures of terrorist women with their new babies Also, ground broad- great they they urged villages, day they point good photo- again point PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE AND CIVIC ACTION 79 casts were used wherever possible A co-operative prisoner might be flown over the area that hid his gang, and he would tell the terrorists on the ground how well he was being treated. Or,the radio would play on the terrorists nerves by repeating incessantly the time and place of a planned attack. In addition, every picture and message contained brief instructions on how to surrender and what areas were safe for anyone wanting to come in Another way of reaching the men in the jungle was through village meetings, in the certain knowledge that among those present were people in touch with the guerrillas. Routine methods also included telling the wounded terrorists where they might come to receive aid, and sending medics to the villages of the aborigines (a tactic that brought gratifying responses, pac- ticularly when it was possible to cure children) {( At someone' $ mention of 'the role of sewing needles and matches;' MR: HOSMER inquired into the participants' experience with gadgets of that kind, as well as with certain 'gimmicks' designed to confuse Of deceive the enemy, and asked for opinions as to their effectiveness With respect to gadgets, COL. FERTIG pointed out that the importance of a given item to the enemy,and hence its value as a bargaining weapon, bore no neces- sary relation to its cost He had once operated in an area of the Philippines to which he and his men gained entrance through a 'side door' that it was essential and yet difficult to protect: The people who lived within the area itself had little use for money O even additional weapons, but their women badly needed sewing needles In a mutually beneficial arrangement, therefore, the head man was given five rounds of ammunition and ten needles, in feturn for which he undertook to protect the side door and sentries posted. COL. FERTIG's side also made effective use of another scarce item S matches _ adding propaganda value to them by having each book carry General MacArthur's picture with the legend "Ishall return_ From the anticommunist campaign in the Philippines, some years later, COL VALERIANO recalled a typical and very simple gimmick that proved most effective in bewildering and frightening individual enemy soldiers He had taken half-sheets of paper, drawn on each of them a staring eye and a triangle with sunrays going out from it, and then had covert patrols plant them in places where the Huks were likely to come across them. The finder's first reaction was likely to "What is this of paper that has no meaning? " ; his second, it must have a meaning, Or the enemy wouldn't have bothered to draw it' As a result,a number of Huk hideouts and sleeping places were abandoned.

GALULA, while operating in Vietminh territory, once posted a faked official order for all male villagers between eighteen and twenty-five years of age to assemble at a certain place and time: Accustomed as were to obeying orders, came; and the French trOops just picked them up. MR PHILLIPS told of & somewhat more intricate scheme executed in Central Vietnam, at the time that the Vietnamese, under the Geneva Agreement, were reoccupying areas long held by the Vietminh: As the Communists withdrew from a locality, consistently refused to exchange their own wartime scrip for regular Vietnamese currency, and the people of the area were stuck with the worthless money. The Vietnamese, therefore, printed and distributed large numbers of leaflets throughout the areas that the Vietminh were about to leave, stating that anyone wanting to exchange communist scrip fof national currency was invited to come on a certain to the last town that the Vietminh were evacuating In fesponse to these leaflets, a tremendous crowd of people S some from as far as 100 miles away 3 arrived at once clamoring for Vietnamese govern- ment currency, and the Vietminh, unable to make the exchange; suffered a blow to their prestige because had to deny what had been assumed to be their own propaganda. At MR HOSMER'$ request, MR PHILLIPS then spoke at length about the civic action programs in Vietnam and Laos with which he had been closely associated, making a strong case for such programs, and naming some of the requisites for successful civic action anywhere. In Indochina the long rebellion against the French had totally disrupted all traditional administrative and other public services Given these chaotic condi- tions, civil administrators were afraid to leave their provincial capitals, thus adding to the neglect and isolation of the villages Civic action in Vietnam or Laos, therefore, came to mean primarily 2 special effort; outside normal admin- istrative channels, to bring the services of government to the villages For, they life, they they they day they PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE AND CIVIC ACTION 81 The first problem in restoring contact between the villages and the central government and re-establishing administrative functions was to regain the people's Ioyalty and their support This was no easy matter, for the departing Vietminh had left behind their agents; who constantly assured the population that the Commu- nists would return and that the wisest course, therefore, was to continue supporting them: The task of effective counteraction was carried out through two different types of organization: through army units and through civilian teams, both trained to approach the people directly and to work side by side: The former technique was an integral part of the armys larger pacification effort in Vietnam: G-5 officers who had taken a course in propaganda and civic action were attached to a battalion and would accompany military units into the area t0 be pacifed, their special task being to ascertain the most urgent needs of the village or villages roads, wells, schools, foofs, etc. and then t0 meet them. To that end, would help set up a village council or similar body to be officially in charge of the undertaking Then, using army supplies and funds, would help the villagers through this organization to carry out the project Once com- pleted, it not only for itself in its benefits to the people but could also be used by propagandists as an example ofwhat communism and the Vietminh had failed to do. The second technique, from earlier experiments in the Philippines, was to take native Vietnamese or Laotian civilians from the ministries, give them special training in how to approach people and teach them certain elementary skills, and send them into the villages in small teams Dressed in black pajamas (the mark of the villager in Vietnam, as compared to the white sharkskin of the ordinary civil administrator), would help the inhabitants with simple projects, instruct them in giving basic medical aid, and initiate various forms of self-help: Then, having trained them to the point of self-sufficiency, would move on: t0 another village to repeat the mission Before leaving the larger area in which had been operating, they normally arranged for a 'civic action CO-ordinator to be appointed at the district Or province level, who would keep the action alive and call in members of the team to advise villagers whenever necessary. One of the problems the teams encountered was that of jealousy from the regular civilian administrators; overcame it by trying, wherever possible, to give the district official most of the credit for the projects in question Another, more serious, problem in the beginning (1955 to 1957) was the American government $ reluctant and inadequate material support for this kind of program, which did not fit neatly into the military and economic aid pattern: special they they spoke tangible copied they they they they 82 COUNTERINSURGENCY: A SYMPOSTUM The over-all operation was somewhat more difficult and limited in Laos than in Vietnam, owing mainly to national differences in education and skills Whereas the average Vietnamese team member could be expected to have roughly the equivalent of a secondary education, his Laotian counterpart was likely to have had no more than three years of schooling Asa result,the work in Laos required longer and more thorough indoctrination, and members of the army were called on to help the teams However, even though the total number of villages covered was much smaller than in Vietnam, the action served a particularly useful function in creating, in the civil service and the government ministries, a recognition of the need for this kind of aid, a sense of moral obligation to continue it within theif jurisdictions, and also, for the first time, an awareness of the manner and style in which to organize and conduct such an effort: Previously, the central administra- tors show of concern for the needs of the provinces had been limited to 'grand tours of the remote areas, where would be received with much ceremony but dared have no meaningful contact with the villagers Some of the men who had helped organize the initial civic action teams were subsequently used to train village, district; and province chiefs, and thus helped in laying the groundwork for an expanding program of government-initiated rural aid Under a different program, conducted in Laos concurrently with the one just described, and aimed at the same objective, goods were stockpiled at the provincial level for self-help projects, and the provincial chief was empowered to release these supplies to any village upon request, provided the villagers agreed to con- tribute to the project by transporting the material and furnishing the labor: This program met with enthusiastic response: In contrary to some Western pre- conceptions about the lethargy of the MR PHILLIPS had found him receptive to ideas and willing to learn as well as work. Education, in particular, had a tremendous appeal. Once, when the government had announced that it would supply the teachers wherever villages built their Own schools, two thousand more schools went up within a few months than there were teachers to fill them: civilian-sponsored program for civic action (in answer to a question from MR HOSMER) is by no means preferable to a military one, in MR PHILLIPS' experi- ence. Indeed, the effort in Laos would have been more far-reaching and effective, had it been military from the very start But the government at first would not approve that idea, for fear of giving the military too much power: And although the civilian effort did receive some help from the military, it was not until 1959,after a change in political leadership, that the Lao army was able to launch a civic action program of its Own, with all the advantages of its large manpower reserves they fact, typical Lao, PSYCHOLOGICAL WARPARE AND CIVIC ACTION 83 Whereas the total number of civilian civic action workers in Laos never exceeded 200, more than 10,000 territorial troops (out of a 25,000-man army) were eventually divided up into six-man teams, who cO-operated with local authori- ties by providing security for the local communities and by assisting the population in a variety of small projects The men were trained for two months (wherever possible, in some special skill) The best-educated in the team would be used as a teacher and provided with schoolbooks and propaganda materials; another was taught elementary medical operations; and the rest were usually 'pick-and-shovel" men: A few of them learned how to operate motion-picture projectors Also, an attempt was made t0 equip each team with a transistof radio SO that the men could listen to broadcasts from the and pass the information on to the local people. In short, the methods were direct and unsophisticated, and wherever the prO- gram was thoughtfully planned and adequately supported, it worked very well and, by its demonstration at the village level, provided the for undertakings on a district or provincial scale However, this program, tOO, suffered from inadequacies and delays in the material support it received from the U.S. government (owing at least in part to disputes over which agency,DOD or ICA, was primarily responsible for it), and never had the consistent support needed to the fullest co-operation of the villagers COL FERTIG commented, in general, on the peculiar difficulty ofobtaining the relatively small subsidies and appropriations that these specialized local programs and operations required He regarded as cypical the response of one of his wartime chiefs to a request for 250,000 pesos to be used for the benefit of American oners in Japanese hands It was too much money to hand out; but too small and cheap a project to get the Pentagon interested in it: MR HOSMER, recalling the tremendous payoff of the 'EDCOR' program in the Philippines, asked COL. BOHANNAN to elaborate on its success The chief value of this particular civic action program, said COL. BOHANNAN, had been thar it furnished an excellent political weapon by disproving one of the main arguments of the enemy's propaganda Because the Huk campaign slogan had been 'land for the landless;' and every Filipino wanted land, it was decided to activate and dramatize a dormant resettlement program (voted in some. time earlier by the Philippine Congress for the benefit of war veterans, but never yet implemented), making sure that only land was offered, and sparing no effort to establish the government's credibility in the eyes of the people: Under the EDCOR program, a surrendered Huk was taken to a resettlement capital spark gain pris- good 84 COUNTERINSURGENCY : A SYMPOSIUM area and given a little house and six hectares of partly cleared land, which he could hope to own in a year or two. Although fewer than a thousand were actually settled in this manner; the morale and propaganda effect of the operation was out of all proportion to the relatively modest investment it had required Civilians tired of supporting the Huks would to the program and tell the rebels to surrender; men who had been guerrillas for ten years Or sO found the prospect attractive. Huk leaders were brought out of the hills under safe-conduct passes,and then sent back to tell the story t0 the guerrillas MR PHILLIPS doubted, however; that a program of this kind could have any lasting profound effect on the political character of a country if it were planned and' conducted merely as a mechanical operation: You have to convince people that you are something witb them as well as for them, he emphasized, and such a program has to yield more than material benefits It must be democratic in sub- stance rather than form, and must establish a bond between the citizen and his government: People have to feel that are not merely beneficiaries but partic- ipants Laos affords numerous examples of the dividends that this approach can yield. With the help, especially, of some Filipinos (who, in spite of a language barrier, communicated better with the average Lao than did many Americans), some Laotian leaders learned to appreciate this basically democratic approach and were able to transmit their enthusiasm t0 others COL GALULA, reviewing the contrasting attitudes and methods of his own unit in Algeria in terms of their results, thought that confirmed all that COL. WHITE and MR. PHILLIPS had been saying The battalion he was later to join arrived in February 1956 (a marine battalion made Up of draftees, except for the officers, and hastily thrown into Algeria from France), and its immediate task was to clear up a heavily populated area about 15 miles from Algiers It was at the height of FLN terrorism, when the population was much against the French, and the troops, afraid and furious, reacted angrily and violently: For the first three months this earned them considerable applause, until the Paris press criticized them for their alleged harsh reprisals, and the battalion was moved t0 Kabylie 'for disciplinary reasons. It was at this that COL. GALULA joined the battalion and undertook the slow but ultimately successful task of indoctrination by which to convince the men that they had to avoid whatever would antagonize the civilian population In the end, some of those who had once resented the label of "pacifcateurs' came t0 feel {{ quite superiof toward the warriors' with their useless methods Despite the physical hardships they suffered, the men in COL. GALULA 's unit became a dis- point doing they they point PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE AND CIVIC ACTION 85 ciplined, dedicated group (they seemed to include few or no Communists), one of whom, for example, bought medical supplies for native babies out of his own pocket because the army had no provisions for them Asked by MR. HOSMER whether he had found it difficult to protect the inform- ers who helped him in the earliest phase of a clearing operation,COL. GALULA said that this had never been a problem, because he did not, except on one occasion,act on the information given him by a single informer. Instead, he waited until he could arrest and interrogate a group of at least three or four men, so that the insurgents would never know which of these had informed against them: Once some degree of control had been established, the informers were no longer in any danger of reprisal; COL. GALULA at first had a platoon to protect the and eventually he would organize a self-defense corps, from which was recruited the (( 'commando de cbasse." J MR HOSMER inquired whether the French had ever had a program for the rehabilitation of FLN prisoners comparable to the EDCOR program in the Philippines Until 1958, said COL. GALULA, there was no over-all policy; FLN members usually would fight to the end rather than surrender,and the treatment of prisoners, left to the discretion of individual commanders, varied greatly. From 1958 on, however, the official aim was to "win over the FLN, though it took years to con- vince the rebels that they could surrender with impunity. COL. GALULA'$ division gave out medals for capturing, but not for killing, FLN members. Once captured, the ordinary soldiers were frequently released and persuaded to join the French forces, where they made the best recruits for the "commandos de cbasse. J} Members of the FLN's political organization, on the other hand, were sent to rehabilitation camps But the work there was bungled for lack of a doctrine, Or & systematic approach, on which to base the enforcement of discipline In many camps, instead of working with prisoners individually, the officers in charge (former Vietminh prisoners, who were impressed with the communist brain- washing methods in Indochina even though these obviously had not had the intended effect on the officers themselves) foolishly attempted to win the FLN political prisoners by indoctrinating them with propaganda, with so little success that some camps turned into virtual seminars for the enemy: In the exceptional camp; by contrast; the personality of the commanding officer at times produced unusual results, and it was not uncommon in those instances for the prisoners t0 be given passes to visit their families Coming back once more to the broader masses, and the means by which to village, 86 COUNTERINSURGENCY : A SY MPOSIUM influence them and help them build a stable society, COL. GALULA had found that in Algeria as undoubtedly elsewhere the long-range to pacification was education: His greatest triumph had been his success in teaching the adults, having overcome the fesistance even of the fathers, who commanded tremendous respect and veneration and were naturally unwilling to expose themselves as more ignorant than their children: Another generally valid principle that COL. GALULA had derived from his experience in Algeria was that activities on behalf of the people among whom one is operating must be pursued, not only for the sake of "doing good; but also for the political benefits likely to accrue from them And perhaps the most important function of the counterinsurgents, and an indispensable step toward consolidating their gains; is to select the new leaders from among the population: key APRIL 19, 1962, AM:* INTELLIGENCE AND COUNTERINTELLIGENCE (I) PROBLEMS AND TECHNIQUES OF INTELLIGENCE- GATHERING, AND THE IMPORTANCE OF COMMUNICATIONS Observations from tbe Anticommunist Campaign in tbe Pbilippines: Metbods of Intelli- gence-gatbering; Blending a Signaling System into tbe Scenario; Air-Ground Intelligence Liaison; Screening a Village for Informants Problems and Metbods of Intelligence Operations in tbe Deep Jungle: Tbe Difficulties of Protecting tbe Informant (Patrolled Malayan "Jungle Forts" as an Alternative to Perimeter Resettlement) Tbe Modus Operandi o tbeJungle Outskirts f Malaya: Tbe Distribution of Intelligence Functions; Resettlement; Food Control; Searcb and Sweep Operations; Camouflaging tbe Movement of Troops and Agents; tbe Intelligence Uses of Dates and Data from tbe Guerrillas' Per- sonal Dossiers A Britisb View on a Desirable Relationsbip between Military and Civilian Autborities: Tbe Administrative Organization in tbe Channeling and Utilization of Intelligence Algeria: Operating Principles and Procedures for Obtain- Information; tbe Problem of Capturing Small Guerrilla Bands on tbe Defensive The Argument for a Large Network of Low-level Agents Communications Monitoring Avoiding tbe Danger of Establisbing Patterns, tbe "Curse" of Guerrilla Warfare Opinions 0n the Limited Usefulness of Bombing in Counterinsurgency Otber Uses of tbe Airplane: Fighter Support; Target-marking MR HOSMERbegan by announcing the main topics for the day s discussions- 'tech- niques of intelligence operations' and 'techniques of communications and control" pointing out that both were of very vital concern to those currently engaged in counterinsurgency.

White 87 Malaya; ing 88 COUNTERINSURGENCY: A SYMPOSIUM while themselves have no warning even of operations involving as many as one thousand Viet Cong: COL. VALERIANO was the first tO at some length about the approaches to intelligence that he had used Or observed in the Philippines, and to mention certain lessons had taught him about the nature of intelligence-gathering The characteristic scenario in which COL: VALERIANO had to operate was a village known to be heavily supporting a Huk squadron in the field, with most able- bodied male inhabitants out among the armed units that were roving the country- side, hiding by and operating by night After trying to determine who was still in the village and who was missing, the most important task ofthe counterinsurgent side was to learn about the village support organization: The typical village turned out to be organized into several units, each with specific support functions In general, these support activities were divided between political affairs (which included education and indoctrination) and more impof- tant to the counterinsurgents intelligence In trying to establish the connection and methods of communication between the intelligence support units in the vil- lage and the units in the field; it was essential to penetrate the village and also, if possible, the armed bands in the hills and swamps Army agents would move among the villagers disguised as peddlers or delivery In one very successful operation, COL. VALERIANO and a small group of agents went into a swamp area controlled by the guerrillas, passing themselves off as public-works surveyors (They were taking advantage of a publicized government plan fof road construction in the area ) Equipped with all the paraphernalia of such a surveying unit; they passed the initial scrutiny of the Huks, who thereafter did not interfere with them, though did them under surveillance and occa- sionally used them to obtain supplies Living with the guerrillas as they did, COL. VALERIANO and his men came to know the pattern of the village support organization, and indeed the entire modus operandi by which the armed Huk units were supplied and taxes raised for their SuppOIt they began to recognize individuals who might be recruited as counteragents. At first, most of those who were approached with the suggestion that work for the government refused t0 co-operate. The reason for their reluctance was either lack of understanding or fear; only rarely was it to be sought in dedi- cation to the guerrilla cause: Those who were successfully recruited in this way, however, formed the basis of an intelligence network that began with few agents and simple methods but grew slowly in numbers and complexity. In the beginning liaison with local agents was maintained by such primitive they speak they day boys: keep they being Also, they INTELLIGENCE AND COUNTERINTELLIGENCE (I) 89 devices as leaving messages under certain stones or behind a given church pillar: Gradually, however; it became possible to obtain a wealth of valuable information by infiltrating small numbers of men, with radio sets; into the outlyingarea, where, hidden in the bushes, they could an eye on the village at all times, observing the routine of all its inhabitants, noting any unfamiliar faces that turned up, and tracing recurrent patterns that pointed to an intelligence network and code: Still later; COL. VALERIANO resorted to kidnapping certain apparently innocuous civil- ians and taking them to distant headquarters, where they were well treated and usually persuaded to divulge some information- including such seemingly inno- cent intelligence as who was particularly friendly with a certain person (who to be the brother of a guerrilla leader) All leads so obtained were then promptly developed on the chance that they might yield something important The Huks' system of communications within their area of operations was sim- ple in its conception and impressive in its effectivenessand reliability; transmission at times was faster than by the government's radio sets COL. VALERIANO' $ men stumbled on the entice system almost by accident; after becoming suspicious of certain repetitive patterns of behavior The basic principle of the guerrillas was to blend all signals into the scenario, using landscape and native customs as camouflage for the code: Thus, in a landscape dotted with houses and small farmyards, one woman, on seeing a of the gov- ernment forces walking around, would open a certain window within sight of the next house; a young girl there, having seen her, would go and nonchalantly open her garden gate; in the next house, a little of nine would watch for that signal, and then run and tie a clothesline from one side of his to another; and s0 the transmission process would continue, until the signal reached the armed Huk forces well outside the village The security circle around the armed camps them- selves was SO good as to be virtually impenetrable, and even the barking of was exploited by the guerrillas as a signal of movement and an indication of its direction: In time, COL VALERIANO's intelligence, tOO, learned to use elements in the environment aS the props fof its own communications system, down to the barking of the which during the night served to alert the counterinsurgents to the secret departure of villagers, who could then be intercepted by blocking forces To track down large concentrations of Huks, COL. VALERIANO' $ unit developed very effective air-ground intelligence liaison with the aid of the light aircraft at- tached to their battalion: To this end, they first fecruited in the guerrilla area per- sons who were able to signal to planes, and who could be expected to learn very keep hap- pened squad boy yard dogs dogs, 90 COUNTERINSURGENCY: A SYMPOSIUM quickly of the presence of any Huk concentrations (for news traveled and the farmers had to be informed of the arrival of any guerrillas they were expected to help feed) Secret patrols then went to instruct those agents in a simple code, which consisted of three basic signals The information sought concerned the size of any enemy force, the direction in which it was moving,and whether or not it was likely t0 stay in the area Each agent would have his own set of signals, different from all others, so as tO avoid establishing patterns and giving the show away: And all of these were mapped and co-ordinated at battalion headquarters In the typical setting in which the ordinary villager lived and moved, the arrangement with the agent_the owner of a house and might be as fol- lows. If he learned that a concentration of guerrillas was due northeast of where he lived, he would lean his plough against the northeast corner of his house; if his information was that the force numbered between 150 and 200 men,he would place two haystacks together; if he learned of a planned ambush, he would open the gate Whatever the particular signals, always blended naturally with the environ- ment and a farmer's typical routine With the several observation posts pinpointed on a large at battalion head- quarters, pilots would be sent out for three flights daily,always by irregular patterns but in such a way as to reach all signals from all posts. Each agent had his code number, under which the pilot would report back to headquarters the information picked up from the ground And even though the intelligence of the individual observer was at best approximate, the signals of all observers combined, when plotted 0n a single map, would yield a surprisingly reliable estimate; 0n the basis of which many successful ambushes were laid. The size of the network depended, of course, on the number of agents that could be recruited, but the general attempt was t0 have at least one ground spotter for every 10 square miles, and often the coverage was much denser: At COL. BOHANNAN' $ suggestion, COL. VALERIANO went on t0 describe his techniques for screening a village in order to obtain informants. After initial blun- ders - L the combination of a blind, uninformed approach, poOr trOOp conduct, lack of discipline,and consequent hostility on the part of the population he standard- ized methods, instituted discipline through rigid supervision of the soldiers, and made the officers responsible for any infractions by the men. In & well-defined oper- ating procedure, the screening force was divided into several specially trained {[ units One of these, the 'enclosing unit;' would seal off all village exits and en- trances; the 'security unit" served as a reserve in support of the enclosing unit; the "collection unit" assembled the inhabitants in the center of the village; still another fast, yard they map INTELLIGENCE AND COUNTERINTELLIGENCE (I) 91 was the search unit" Members of this last unit would visit and search individual houses in the company of a leading village official, who then signed a statement that nothing but subversive materials had been seized (to forestall any Huk allegations that the searchers were fobbing the citizens) The collecting unit would separate the men from the women and children, keep them from communicating with one another; and send them, in turn, t0 be individually interrogated. Afterward, the testimony of alleged relatives and friends would be compared, and false cover stories spotted by cross-examination On such minor details as family birthdays and recent breakfast fare. Psychological warfare methods included simple dramatics (a witness who ap- peared to have been shot dead for not giving the asked-for information,at the sight of whose 'body;' covered with chicken blood,the next man invariably volunteered to speak) , and also such subtler techniques as disguising a soldier as a village in- former, covering him with a canvas sack, with holes only for his eyes, and asking him to identify the person being interrogated a spectacle so demoralizing that it alone was often enough to persuade a man to tell the truth: Once everyone was known to have been separately interrogated, and all men were thus under equal suspicion of having passed on whatever intelligence was divulged, it was quite safe for any loyal person to come forward with information Prolonged screening processes, during which large numbers of people would be sitting around idle, also offered an opportunity for the civic action teams to make their first impression: They would talk t0 the waiting crowds, entertain the children, administer medical treatment and advice, and generally show the popu- lace that their aim was to be helpful, not vindictive. After repeated visits of this kind, if it was possible to the nuisance factor to a minimum, most villages responded; it was not uncommon for the brother of a Huk commander to come for- ward and promise to talk his brother into surrendering, on condition that the brother not be harmed. In order to win their CO-operation, the government forces had to convince the civilians of two that were determined to get the information they needed, and thac; far from wanting to shoot down every guerrilla that came out of the bush (as Huk propaganda alleged), they were prepared to deal humanely with those who surrendered. CAPT. JEAPES, whose chief experience had been with the SAS (Special Air Service) in the Malayan jungle, had faced a rather different and more difficult prob lem in obtaining information from the natives The Chinese terrorists (CTs) had withdrawn from the perimeter, where were controlled, into the jungle keep things: they deep they 92 COUNTERINSURGENCY: A SYMPOSIUM inhabited by the peaceful nomadic aborigines, and had won the confidence of those simple people by teaching them how to produce more and better food in exchange for a pOrtion of the crop. When the SAS moved the aborigines at first denied having seen any terrorists, but as the men and lived with the natives for weeks on end, the information began to come in. After a few months, however, the unit would have to leave; the CTs would return, reprisals were severe and often bloody, and the next security force that came in would have & hopelessly diffcult time eliciting any information at all In an unsuccessful experiment some of the aborigines nearer the outskirts of the jungle were moved into resettlement areas, safe from the Chinese; but although better provided for than ever before in their lives, these jungle nomads could not live outside theif natural surroundings better solution turned out to be the construction of SO-called jungle forts In areas where the SAS found enough local tribes to warrant it, the patrols would begin by cutting a landing zone for helicopters, which would then fy in materials and Malay police: With the help of the Malayans and even some of the aborigines the jungle fort would then be built,not as a stronghold, but as a base to which the patrols could come for food, ammunition, and,most important, medical equipment (the most persuasive factor in winning the aborigines' support for the security forces) These jungle forts consisted of sandbag positions at the center, some atap huts around them in which people could sleep, storage facilities,and a few outposts on the periphery that would enable those inside to withstand a limited attack. Not to be confused with some thirteen-odd large base forts, which included landing strips and fortifications, these jungle forts were actually no more than central police pOsts from which the tribal area would be continually patrolled (by police, rather than by the SAS, whose job had really ended with the settingupofthearrangement) As saw frequent patrols and police,as the security forces helped them to improve their crops without asking a share of them in return, as they received medical care, presents of cloth, and_ when needed it; food, and as now and then saw one of their erstwhile communist demigods in a sad state of defeat; the aborigines came to feel better protected and cared-for by the legitimate forces than ever had been by the terrorists were even willing to suppress theic nomadic preferences and stay within the patrolled area, especially since they were compensated for any crop losses suffered as a result; and as they felt safer and friendlier; they began to volunteer information without urging Personal contact; however; was all-important in winningand maintaining their confidence, and it was the unorthodox soldier (the man who was regarded in his in, stayed they they they They they they INTELLIGENCE AND COUNTERINTELLIGENCE (I) 93 own unit as slightly mad) who often proved to possess the greatest faculty for mak- ing himself liked and accepted by the natives to & degree that the CTs had never achieved. Every police post would select several such men and assign them as men to the tribes under its control, one to each tribe By living, feasting, and play- cards with the pengbulu, they would quickly win the popularity that enabled them to obtain what information wanted. COL WHITE, operating in the settled areas outside the jungle, had encountered entirely different intelligence problems requiring different techniques Figure 3 served as basis for his description of the modus operandi within two Or three years after his arrival in a "black" area: The town in the northwest corner; including the adjoining village (a particu- larly bad one originally located to the southwest; which had been moved, crops and all, to the outskirts of the large town), as well as all other villages and the living areas of the plantations, were completely surrounded by wire s0 as to help keep the bandits out and the food in. Originally,it was easy enough for innocent-looking tappers to g0 out and meet with the bandits at the jungle's edge (sometimes wear- ing three shirts and a of shoes, which they would shed before returning), and almost as easy for the terrorists to mix with the people in the plantations, carrying back with them rice and other supplies These possibilities were greatly curtailed by the wire enclosures, together with & strictly enforced curfew ~tt no tapping after 4 in the afternoon, and all lights out at 8 The very effective food-denial plan fe- quired all food, both in towns and on the plantations, to be centrally cooked, with carefully calculated rations, and handed out twice a These activities were well guarded by the police (never the military) O, in the later stages of control, the home COL. WHITE' $ forces faced three kinds of enemies: (a) The armed work forces' (AWFs), jungle-based and under the leadership of & former schoolteacher; who were natives of the area, knew every inch of the terrain, and had friends and rela- tives among the population th whom they maintained regular contact; visitingat certain times and places, and communicating by much the same signals as those ([ COL VALERIANO had described earlier; (b) the independent platoons;" killer-boys who operated in the deep jungle but would come out long enough to collect medi- cal supplies and food and ambushes, and who were connected with one another throughout Malaya by courier routes and occasionally, though not often, by radio; and (c) the communist headquarters in the south and in the north; and the main headquarters in the central section of Malaya, which directed the over-all operation Against this background, the information to be gathered was of two kinds, key ing they typical pair day. guard. wie lay 94 COUNTERINSURGENCY : A SYMPOSIUM Big town (13,000 to I5,000 inhabitonts) Area of rubber plantations Jungle town Villoge TI "Bad" village moved t0 of town Plantation Independent platoon Large enemy concentration in jungle AWF Armed Work Force FIG 3_The Modus Operandi on the Jungle Outskirts of AWF AWF AWF 9 4 Big edge Malaya INTELLIGENCE AND COUNTERINTELLIGENCE (I) 95 military intelligence and "special branch intelligence The former,a direct respon- sibility of COL WHITE in his capacity of military commander; was obtained largely by two standard methods: by tracing the past history of the AWF $ and independent platoons in an effort to discern a pattern for the direction of their movements, the frequency and intervals of their visits, and the particular estates at which they made contact, so as to be able to anticipate them; and by patrolling, thereby hoping to find tracks, to stumble on a courier poSt, and to set ambushes from which to observe the enemy's movements. The more complex task was that of the head of the actual intelligence organi-" zation (the "Special Branch"), whose office, like COL. WHITE' $ command post; was inside the police station and next t0 that of the head of police: He obtained his information through agents, from captured terrorists and surrenderers, and by search-and-sweep operations COL. WHITE and his military intelligence officer CO- operated and consulted with this chief of the local Special Branch at every OPpPOC- tunity, deferring to his authority and judgment, and passing On to him and his very efficient staff for development and action all captured prisoners and anyone who came to the military offering information The Special Branch officer, familiar to all the natives, was known to have his pockets stuffed with Malayan money that he was ready to hand out in exchange for information. Moreover, safe" houses were maintained outside the village, to which newly captured persons could be taken by armored car without anyone's knowing their whereabouts or the fact of their capture COL WHITE cited the spectacular case of the terrorist area leader; who was cap- tured with his wife, spirited to such a safe house,and persuaded to join the govern- ments side, at handsome pay- After a trial contact with the villagers, to make sure that no one knew of his capture or was likely to suspect him, he rejoined the CTs as a government agent and, within six months; was responsible for forty captures Search-and-sweep operations in Malaya were much as described by COL. VALE RIANO, except for the fact that the search area was cordoned off; the trOops did the searching, but the Special Branch officer and his men did the interrogating, and villagers were obliged to be present to witness the correctness of the proceedings Despite the fact that intelligence was centered (wisely, COL. WHITE thought) in one organization, despite the efficiency of Special Branch and its growing network of agents, and even though most of the enemy's signals gradually became known, there were occasions even late in the war when all the information was at hand and the CTs nevertheless succeeded in outwitting their opponents COL, WHITE then outlined in some detail the structure by which at every level 96 COUNTERINSURGENCY: A SYMPOSIUM from the center of government; through the nine Malayan states,down to thelocal level at which he himself was operating-policies and decisions were vested jointly in the chief administrative officer, the top military men, and the civilian head of the Special Branch: Below the capital these functions were combined in the State War Executive Committees (SWEC's),and below these in area War Executive Com- mittees (several such WEC's to a state, their exact number depending 0n the area'$ geographical characteristics and the size of enemy and troop concentrations in it) In COL WHITE' $ command, collaboration took the form of scrupulous consul- tation in advanceof every move Indeed,it was symbolized in the so-called morning prayers, daily meetings attended by the commander or his deputy, the district officer, the head policeman;, the local head of Special Branch, as well as persons of more Iimited responsibility (such as the men in charge of food denial,forestry, and the like). The commander took no major step without the blessing of both the police chief and the head of Special Branch, and each was at all times fully in- formed of all activities of the other two The military intelligence officer, though he did not know everything that Special Branch was enjoyed its confidence and had enough information for a fruitful collaboration. The peculiar circumstances in which operations were conducted, the need to move amidst watchful women and children who were known to be enlisted in the enemy's elaborate signaling system, and the fact that the several companies of a battalion were distributed over a large area (with some as much as 20 miles from headquarters) required the strictest measures for the protection of all plans, large and small No plan was ever made without the presence, and the express approval, of the signal officer (a point whose importance COL. WHITE stressed the more em- phatically as he felt that it was not sufficiently appreciated in the American forces). Once a decision had been made and orders had been given to the company, no one was allowed to leave the company area until the operation was well launched As 2 standard precaution in nearly all operations, the trOops would leave by night: Moreover, to camouflage the movement of troops and agents, military vehi- cles were in motion at all times on roads specially built along the jungle fringe: On those occasions when were transporting troops, the men were trained to leave them, fully equipped, at speeds of up to 20 miles an hour, to dis- appear into the jungle singly, and to reassemble at a prearranged place. (They usually were picked up by helicopters, and returned after a circuitous flight) Special Branch maintained accurate dossiers on the guerrillas, as well as on the wives who were with them and on their families in the villages Knowing which wives were pregnant; the troops would listen for the cry of a baby in the jungle at doing, kept they INTELLIGENCE AND COUNTERINTELLIGENCE (I) 97 the appropriate time, O1 lie in wait for the visiting father if the child was born in the village Wherever possible, the dossiers included photographs of the men (and even the women) which, aside from their obvious usefulness in identification, con- tributed to trOOp morale by giving the men a sense of knowing what the enemy looked like whom they were asked to chase. CAPT: JEAPES recalled a time, before helicopter traffic in and out of the jungle became relatively easy, when SAS patrols were equipped with small, cheap cameras and asked to photograph every CT they killed and take his fingerprints, for use in identification and also in sta- tistics on the size Of the enemy forces. Finally, terrorists as well as counterinsurgents watched the calendar closely for any holidays Chinese, Indian, Malay, Australian ~ when those feasting and drinking might be expected to felax their guard. COL WHITE at times planned entire operations, with the aid of the calendar, in terms of such calculations The techniques used in Algeria were similar in some respects, yet differed in others in response to the unique demands of the situation: The French; COL GALULA explained, were up against three types of rebel units and organizations: the armed forces of the FLN, separately organized terror groups, and the rebels' politi- cal organization within the population. Moreover, the intelligence problem varied greatly, and required different techniques, with each of the three main stages of the war, which were determined by changing ratios of military strength and popular support In the first stage, from the beginning of the war in November 1954 until early 1956,the rebellion spread like brushfire,and the French had neither enough troops nor any support from the people, with the result that farely obtained intelligence and, if did, were unable to act on it. In the second stage, from early 1956 to 1957, were still lacking popular support; and theic operations, therefore; were blind rather than planned on the basis of intelligence: But man- power by then was adequate,and the forces succeeded in breaking the FLN military organization to the point of reducing it t0 very small units Only in the third and final stage, however, did the French have sufficient SuppOrt from the populace as well as the means to stage major operations (the main problems,by that time, being by the rugged terrain and the fact that the armed rebel bands were too small to offer targets) Support from the people was clearly the crucial determinant for successful intelligence, and, hence, ultimately for victory- At the highest level of theater and government; where it was possible to intercept the rebels' radio broadcasts to their organizations in Algeria and abroad, the French did have information, but nly of deep they good they they they posed 98 COUNTERINSURGENCY: A SYMPOSIUM the kind that is transmitted through such channels Below these, intelligence had to be obtained from the people, and at the beginning it was at best sporadic; infor- mation volunteered by captured rebels, if not actually false, was either already known or impossible to exploit The first systematic breakthrough came from the realization that the rebels were forcing their organization, including the obligation to contribute t0 its sup- port, on the people, all of whom knew the identity of the FLN agent who collected their money and in turn, Was in touch with the higher echelons With this approach in mind, and aided by the fact that, nominally and physically, were in control throughout Algeria while the rebels were hiding, the French compart- mentalized the country,and the officer and his unit in charge of a compartment were thus able to interrogate and get to know every person within that sector: Themethod was simple and effective However,there were mistakes and abuses that led in early 1957 to the formation of a special unit; called detacbement operationel de brotection. These were security trOops, which were sent as needed to any local commander on his request: On the same principle, an army paratroop division was called in to take over police functions in Algiers in 1957 after a small terrorist unit of about rebels had effectively terrorized the entire of 600,000, including the once loyal police. It took the army just one month to wipe out the FLN's civil organization in Algiers COL. GALULA, tOo, had effectively with the problem of breaking the civil organization in the villages and towns within his command and of persuad- the people to pass on the information he needed. He proceeded from the knowledge that the rebels had a three-man committee in every village the leader; the political commissar, and the money collector), and that the villagers knew every one of the three COL. GALULA 's favorite and most successful technique, shortly after he had begun to garrison a was to arrest simultaneously several citizens for minor infractions of the curfew Or Other fules, and to them locked up with- out further punishment Of trial. He would interrogate them every until, worn out with waiting and feeling somewhat protected by their very number, talk one by one. After that, COL. GALULA could arrest the village FLN cell and its collaborators anywhere from ten to fifteen people knowing that these were the right people: Once a village had been purged, the information always flowed ily: And every reconstituted political organization proved inferior to the previous generation and easier to break who, they fifty city coped ing village , keep day, would they read- INTELLIGENCE AND COUNTERINTELLIGENCE (I) 99 The diffculty in Algeria came as the rebels' armed forces declined in size. From up to battalion size in early 1957 they went to less than company strength & year latef, until in 1959 the armed enemy consisted only of many small groups of three to ten men. In their attempt to survive, these isolated insurgent bands were favored, on the one hand, by the rugged terrain and, on the other hand, by the surprising density of the population: For one could easily obtain what food needed; the weekly market to which crowds of people came from far away, was tOo well established a custom for the government to stop, and it made any food-denial plan useless: Observation from the air or through binoculars was equally unsuccessful, as the rebels moved only by night Eventually, the problem was attacked somewhat more efficiently with the organization of the aforementioned commandos de cbasse These units of 30 to 120 men (most of them rebel defectors) were lightly equipped and supplied (the problem of supply and reinforcement was simple because of the large number of posts throughout the country) and sent out into the woods for as much as five on end to watch and stalk any guerrillas found, overpower them if could, and otherwise send the alarm. In the end, however, the surviving rebel bands, though their identities were well known, were caught largely by accident; like small flies in a large net, for they had lost contact with the popula- tion, and any information leading to a capture was thus no more than a happy chance: COL GALULA gave two examples of the virtual hopelessness of this lem His troops tried for thfee years to capture the leader of one of the five major regional areas, whose radio communication with Tunisia were intercepting But, although the man's position had been spotted within & perimeter of less than 5 miles, and a total of 2000 troops in those three years went out in an attempt to capture him, he was and killed only when he accidentally fell into an ambush while on his way [O a meeting in Tunisia in early 1959. The previous May, Joseph Alsop had visited the command post and accom- 4 panied COL GALULA on what later called a blank ten battalions trying in vain to catch a group of from ten to thirty rebels known to be hiding in a certain forest area, 6 kilometers and 4 kilometers wide. After a decep tion operation the battalions, carefully spaced out, had moved in from all sides during the first hours of darkness, completed the 'encirclement" two hours before sunrise, and found no onel In answer t0 a final question about the density of French government troops: COL GALULA'$ sector (about 20 miles and 20 miles wide) had seven battalions thing, they they day, days they they prob- they caught Alsop day' long ong 100 COUNTERINSURGENCY : A SYMPOSIUM in June 1956; four battalions in the spring of 1957; two in 1959; and only one in 1960, whose strength was not concentrated, but was distributed (with the help of the militia) over all the posts once occupied by seven battalions and several newer posts as well: COL FERTIG, though technically he had been on the guerrilla side, likened some of his problems to those of the counterinsurgents. His organization fepre- sented a legitimate government; which had to bring into line certain dissident guerrilla operators, with the Japanese obviously as a third and major factor He subscribed wholeheartedly to the idea that only a very large number of agents and informants can supply the kind of intelligence most needed in counter- insurgency- quite contrary to the orthodox military belief that one good agent is better than a lot of poor ones Might a machine be devised, he wondered, which, on being fed a great deal of semireliable information from many minor agents, could come up with a picture as full and accurate as would be supplied by a small number of top agents? COL. FERTIG then recalled various specific aspects of his Philippine experience: The aim of his troops had been to force the Japanese to patrol in large ele- ments, rather than in many small units, so as to furnish targets Also, the larger the operation the more planning it required, and the guerrillas were usually forewarned of an impending major attack by an increase in radio traffic Thus, in country where all movement was by animal or on foot; they had time to move out Of the way of the attackers Then, when the patrols were returning to the garrison, tired and more careless as neared the end of the trek, the guer- rillas would try to trap them: The most dangerous element against the guerrillas was the Bureau of Con- stabulary established by the Japanese Filipinos indistinguishable from the guerrillas themselves But; as mentioned earlier, the steady harassment of these active trOOpS forced the Japanese to withdraw them, leaving only the Japanese enemy himself: The war in the Philippines proved to COL. FERTIG, among other things, that the guerrilla, in order to survive and win, must have better intelligence about the enemy than the enemy has about him: The Philippine guerrillas were fortunate in being provided, from the start; with Australian radio equipment and in having the operators to handle it: They were forced, however, to remove the voice tubes from the sets, as even the strictest discipline could not prevent the men from making the occasional idle remark that; if monitored, would give their position away. they INTELLIGENCE AND COUNTERINTELLIGENCE (I) 101 With the Japanese in control of the ait, and night movements limited by the presence of snakes and crocodiles, guerrilla operations were normally con- fined to small parties (mostly three Or four men, and never more than a squadron except on the waterways), who went out just before dawn carrying their own supplies In controlled areas would move as much and as often as possible to convince the population that it was being protected. Everything was done to avoid establishing patterns ("the curse of the guer- rilla movement;' as COL. FERTIG called it) A platoon was allowed to operate in a area for no more than ten refresher courses in jungle warfare taught the importance of avoiding such habits as cooking every day at the same time or sleeping in the same place; and training camps as well as headquarters were moved frequently, except in protected areas. Before moving headquarters (sixty-one days being the longest that COL FERTIG ever stayed in any one), the guerrillas would build three of four new ones in different spots, and until the morning of the move no one knew which would actually be occupied. These precautions were indicated because the Japanese were using much the Same kinds of sources as the guerrillas (bar-room conversations and low- level agents) and were building up a good intelligence network To some extent; succeeded in penetrating the guerrilla organization, though never very deeply: One of their mistakes was to give their intelligence net a twofold job collection as well as penetration; another blunder, widely publicized by the guerrilla side, was to execute their own informers as well as enemy agents. Going back to counterinsurgent operations in Malaya, MR HOSMER asked COL. SHIRLEY whether he and his operations-research group had concerned them- selves with problems of intelligence They had not, COL SHIRLEY explained, but had confined themselves to the examination of weapons equipment and techniques, with a view to applying operations-research methods to their improve ment The chief reasons for not entering directly into the area of intelligence were (a) that his group was skilled only in the field of communications intel- ligence, and this form of intelligence, though vitally important, was not obtain- able and usable in that theater and that kind of war as one would like to imagine; and (b) that communications monitoring in Malaya did not play the part that one had come to assume on the basis of the European experience in World War II COL. SHIRLEY elaborated on both these points The methods that COL. WHITE had described earlier were typical and most satisfactory for all military operations against small enemy concentrations With close liaison between the military and the Special Branch S most important at battalion level, but repeated wherever they given days; they 102 COUNTERINSURGENCY: A SYMPOSIUM possible at company level ~= Special Branch obtained the information and fed it to the commander; who used it as a basis for planning ambushes and attacks General headquarters, where COL SHIRLEY was working with both army and air force; would receive the occasional request for air force action against an enemy camp inside the jungle fringe to which the battalion commander had decided not to commit his troops, and would be supplied with whatever intelligence, locally obtained, might help pinpoint the location of the camp on the photographs of the jungle fringe that were maintained at headquarters As it turned out, however, the information was rarely accurate enough for the precise map feferences that were needed by the pilots In addition, the aircraft were fitted with navigational aids that were inadequate for the particular terrain, distances, and low-level attacks involved The conclusion among the operations-research staff,therefore, was that sudden surprise of the enemy 3 the most desirable and most difficult objective ~ was in most instances achieved, not in direct response to intelligence, but through essen- tially orthodox techniques that had been modified and sharpened (above all through the patient and persistent combing of any area where enemy movement was suspected) As for the monitoring of communications, it came as something of a shock to those conditioned by the European theater, who had been taught the importance of radio security and the need for deception techniques, to realize that the prime requirement for the m lilitary in Malaya was simply to get through: Any concern about interception by the Communists was overshadowed by the effort to overcome the difficulty, inadequacy, and slowness of communications The British battalion groups operated on & number of fixed high frequencies, which in many cases they did not change from one end of the month, Or even the year, to the next; unless it were t0 avoid interference. Furthermore, all the units of a battalion were On the same frequency, s0 as to heighten the chances that every report would be picked up by at least one Of them. Detection and identification should thus have been quite easy for the Chinese terrorists, but if they did intercept; there was no dence that it ever off for them: Had there been, the British would quickly have changed the system. As a final point in the morning $ discussion, MR HOSMER raised the question of the usefulness of bombing in guerrilla and counterguerrilla warfare How many kills, he asked COL. SHIRLEY, could the average bombing run in Malaya be expected to yield? In the period of the emergency with which he had been associated (that is, evi- paid INTELLIGENCE AND COUNTERINTELLIGENCE (I) 103 1949-1951), COL. SHIRLEY did not recall evidence of anyone's being killed by the daily sorties against targets There were several reasons planes were never- theless used: (a) they had an undeniable psychological effect on the guerrillas; (b) provided stops across lines of escape that could not be covered by infantry (a far preferable system); and (c) were a means of justifying the presence of as much air force strength as London would permit, against the possibility that these planes might suddenly have to play a vital part in a larger limited war with Communist China In Malaya the planes actually had a very limited function in the attack role. They clearly could not be used against villages, nor even in the areas between settlements Their use remained confined to the jungle fringe and (in response, for example, to a radio message from CAPT: JEAPES reporting the presence and location of a camp) the deep jungle: The problem of target-marking, the participants agreed, was never solved satisfactorily, though balloons were the preferred method. COL. SHIRLEY recalled general headquarters' preoccupation with the difficulty of sighting a communist camp without being sighted first by the concealed communist sentries on the perimeter tracks The opportunity to use a balloon as target marker was thus rare indeed, because the CTs would disperse on the alarm from their sentries COL SHIRLEY did not; however, rule out the possible usefulness of such a target-marking device in theaters where the guerrilla has become very strong and his larger units thus offer more substantial targets Vietnam, he thought, might prove to be such an area, as the situation there appeared to be moving from sublimited to limited warfare_ COL. WHITE had found bombing a waste of money and of time because of the small size of enemy groups and the difficulty of accurate positioning He had} however; used fighter support with some success. Indeed, if the enemys camps had been larger, this might have been the answer, though, to be fully effective, it would have required the shortening and simplification of communications to the planes Once again, however; COL. WHITE warned against overemphasizing the British operational experiences in with its basic framework of established British administration and a loyal native police, it had been an atypical theater, where commanders like himself never faced some of the formidable problems and obstacles that confronted other members of the Symposium. why they they Malaya; APRIL 19, 1962, P.M.* INTELLIGENCE AND COUNTERINTELLIGENCE (II) ORGANIZATION, METHODS, AND COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS AND EQUIPMENT Psycbological Foundations for an Effective Intelligence Network Tbe Value of a Single Intelligence Service versus Separate Civilian and Military Organizations Sev- eral Counterinsurgent Campaigns: How Tbeir Intelligence Organizations Reflect tbe Unique Circumstances of Eacb Tbe Potential Role of tbe Civilian Police: A Question of Reliability, Power, and Training Enabling tbe Informer To Pass Intelligence witb Impunity Mecbanical Problems of Effective Communications in Diffcult Terrain: A Specialist's Account of Researcb and Experimentation in Malaya (tbe Use of Skywave; Cboosing Optimum Frequencies; Some Causes of Failures and Tbeir Cor- rections; tbe Problems of Accurate Tuning and Workable Antennas; Making Do witb Available Equipment) Batteries and Various Types of Generators: Tbe Problem of Powering Radio Sets under Adverse Conditions of Climate and Resupply Recent Improvements in Communications Equipment Divergent Opinions 0r Requisites for an Adequate Village or Outpost Alarm System (from Pusb-button Signal to Two- way Voice Transmission) Facilities and Procedures for Instant Responsive Action as tbe Crucial Requirement for an Effective Signaling System An Example from tbe Pbilippines: A Successful Signaling System Based 0*2 Simple Devices, Careful Organization, and Adaptation to tbe Local Scene Tbe Case for tbe Simple, Inex- pensive Gadget over tbe More Complex Tbe "Paraffn Test" and Possible Analogous Devices To Identify Guerrillas BEFORE THE GROUP addressed itself to the details of intelligence and counter- intelligence techniques, COL SHIRLEY made this general and basic point; on which he was seconded by other participants: People, he said, are alike in that they want to be on the winning side; therefore, if the democracies can convince the local nation in a guerrilla warfare theater that rather than the Com- #Present: Col.

SHIRLEY $ statement; pointed out that the Communists themselves fully recognized its truth and, therefore; in theif prOp- aganda never let up on the theme of inevitable final victory even in the face of setbacks. CAPT. JEAPES had seen the success of this tactic well illustrated among the people of Southeast Asia Although the large majority of these were not Com- munists but industrious, peaceful people interested mainly in their families and the business of making a living, many of them worked for the CTs in Malaya, for example, because felt they had no alternative: Indeed, they begged the British to protect them, in wire enclosures if necessary, against having to help the Communists Turning t0 the specific techniques of both sides in various past theaters of operations, MR PHILLIPS described some of the difficulties the Laotian govern- ment had had to overcome before it could establish the kind of relations with the people that would yield information In the of French rule, when the Communists first Came to a village of peaceful Laotians unwilling to do violence to anybody, methodically set about involving and implicating individuals in terrorist acts, convincing them that were thereafter on the French black- ist and had best prepare for retaliation, and thus gradually committing more and more of them to anti-French attitudes and violent action Once committed to the other side,these people were difficult to win back: COL. BOHANNAN returned the discussion t0 the idea of a single intelligence organization 3 which COL WHITE had defended at the morning session, and which undoubtedly had proved workable in Malaya = as one that he thought inconceivable as well as inadvisable in any country not accustomed to British rule and its unique practices The safer system, whose adoption COL. BOHANNAN favored fof all countries faced with insurgency problems, was one in which military intelligence played the primary role, with a second (civilian) intelligence service fulfilling its own useful functions, and each service checking o the other to prevent the danger of its usurping tOO much power 0 becoming corrupt: In this way, to be sure, the information might have to go all the way up to the presi- dent s office before it could be fully co-ordinated, but the greater danger, COL they gain they they they days they they 106 COUNTERINSURGENCY: A SYMPOSIUM BOHANNAN thought; in allowing the fear of exposing operational plans IO control the intelligence system: He cited as symptomatic of this mistaken atti- tude COL WHITEs remark that he "knew everything, but [his] intelligence officer did not Moreover, he was not easily persuaded that the British system was necessarily the more efficienc In the Philippines between 1947 and 1950 the following were working on the communist problem in Manila alone: Military Intelligence Service (MIS) of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (with separate branches of intelli- gence and counterintelligence), the Philippine Constabulary, the National Bureau of Investigation, the Ministry of the Interior; secret agents of the president; Customs, Immigration, Internal Revenue, secret agents of the Special Branch of the Manila Police, and intelligence agents of other countries With all the in- evitable confusion, overlapping, and rivalry that went with this diversity of effort; these many organizations, with large numbers of people and very little money, did a good job of maintaining intelligence On the Communists. Later; when action against the Huks really got under way, intelligence activity in the field was the responsibility of MIS, whose support of the combat forces took two forms. Certain teams were more or less permanently assigned to the combat forces (each battalion combat team had one MIS team); other teams operated directly out of 'headquarters, either to augment a particular combat team Or to work independently of the military commander in the area The permanent assignment of MIS officers throughout an area with a view tO establishing informants' nets against possible subversion, all the while co-operating closely with any combat units in the area, seemed to COL. BOHANNAN a sine qua non in all countries with actual or potential guerrilla problems CAPT. JEAPES (speaking also on behalf of the absent COL. WHITE) was shocked at the assumption of other-than-total trust between the services: But to COL_ BOHANNAN a certain degree of distrust, rivalry, and even occasional enmity between the civilian and the military intelligence services was a fact of life that did not seriously affect the capacity for fighting the common enemy; obviously, one had to seek within such a system what co-ordination and collaboration one could achieve To COL. SHIRLEY, who described the single-service arrangement as adminis- tratively and psychologically the only possible extension of the situation che military encountered on arriving in Malaya, COL BOHANNAN granted that this was indeed the natural and best method for Malaya (as fof other parts of the British Empire) But compare this, he suggested, with the average South American, lay INTELLIGENCE AND COUNTERINTELLIGENCE (II) 107 Middle Eastern, Or Southeast Asian country, where the principal business of the armed forces is to maintain internal security in Case Of a febellion, while the ministry of the interior most likely controls a national police force (which, if necessary, can be played off against the armed forces), and, finally, the president [( may have his own national intelligence service" to watch over the first two. In case of rebellion, if the army had no intelligence service of its Own, it would have t0 rely on that of the police, and this would fesult not only in interservice dependence and rivalry, but also in an unsatisfactory fow of information wherever (as is likely to be the case) at least part of the police is connected with or in favor of the rebellion. The only safeguard against such a situation, COL BOHANNAN repeated; is a separate military intelligence service, with resident officers and agents throughout the country who co-operate with the police and other services but owe allegiance to the armed forces The police in a given country, COL. SHIRLEY pointed out, may be fully trust- worthy if properly supported. (No doubt the British had an alternative system in readiness, had the police in Malaya not been loyal.) He stressed also the basic difference between, say, the present picture in Vietnam, and the kind of counter- insurgency operation that begins and is well launched as a mere police action before the military forces are called in-the case of and also of Kenya The operations rooms that the British trOops found set up in the police stations on their arrival in Malaya were already impressive centers of intelligence operations; the police quickly proved itself both efficient and loyal; they had all the informa- tion that the battalion commander lacked; and the working arrangement followed naturally from this situation, with the police lookingafter the undercover methods and the troops concentrating On the typically military (in a sense more orthodox) intelligence: Algeria (COL GALULA) experienced both the unified and the dual system, as these had just been described. At the higher levels, that is t0 Say, in the cities, the intelligence task was divided among (a) the Police de Renseignements Generaux, (b) the Surete, and (c) the Bureau de Securite de Territoire (counterintelligence) In the rural areas, by contrast, the Surete did not operate; the civilian police was powerless; the constabulary was militarily oriented; and the army, therefore, did all intelligence work in the field with a single (military intelligence) service: The situation in the Philippines (COL_ FERTIG) was different from any of those mentioned The Huk insurgents were Filipinos, and the troops in the field fghting them were Filipinos. With only few American advisors, and much fumbling and pressure at the political level because of vested interests, the counterinsurgency keep Malaya 108 COUNTERINSURGENCY: A SYMPOSIUM effort was slow in being organized. COL. BOHANNAN likened that situation to the one in Vietnam today. Much though the United States would like him to, Presi- dent Diem is not prepared to create the kind of intelligence organization that would be most efficient, for fear that unscrupulous politicians might try to control of so powerful an instrument and use it to cut his throat In other words, Diem must tolerate inefficiency to remain strong and keep his opponents from uniting ("a tradition of France;' was COL. GALULA' $ comment, "where a single, unified police and intelligence service is considered dangerous") For South Vietnam, and indeed for most underdeveloped countries, MR PHILLIPS was inclined to make a case for the military man as the best intelligence person The police in most new countries lack, among other the experience and the training that would make them & useful intelligence organization against the guerrillas In MR PHILLIPS' experience, & combat commander in the army in a country such as Vietnam is often not only the best intelligence officer but also the best administrator and the best economic developer ofan area; it is a fact; though it may not be very desirable or even efficient; that a few reliable and competent men usually end up running everything anyway, civil as well as military. CAPT. JEAPES, strengthening his earlier argument against the supremacy of military intelligence, contended that the average villager was likelier to entrust his information to the policeman he had known all his life than to the unknown soldier from outside the village. This was not necessarily So, said COL. BOHANNAN; the villager could have good political reasons for distrusting his policeman- neighbor; yet might have been well impressed with the armys efficiency and its ability to protect him: COL, VALERIANO looked at the question from still another angle. The villager (who is eager; above all, not to stick his neck out) prefers to report to the man who is in a position t0 act On the information immediately _ & possible reason that he may choose to go to the village law-enforcement officer rather than to the MIS man who must first report to headquarters The potential informer who has trouble finding a safe way of parting with his information, everyone agreed, is a common problem: CAPT: JEAPES recalled a simple and effeccive method used in Malaya, by which the police would surround a village during curfew and leave a piece of blank paper at every house; in the morn- they would let each villager his paper (unmarked except for the informa- tion itself) into a large which was later opened at police headquarters, with the anonymicy of the informants thus fully protected. As another tried channel of information COL. FERTIG mentioned the Catholic priest; at least SO as the enemy is an agent of communism Or another ungodly cause: gain things, drop ing, box, long INTELLIGENCE AND COUNTERINTELLIGENCE (II) 109 To MR HOSMER the preceding discussion showed a very general agreement on the importance of intelligence in fighting the guerrilla, but at the Same time it revealed the absence of any consensus on the mechanics by which to achieve it Methods will have tO vary from area to area and according to local conditions, and it is clearly futile to try to formulate any generally applicable rule: MR HOSMER then invited COL: SHIRLEY to speak about the problems and techniques of communications, & field in which the Colonel had particularly wide and valuable experience The War Office in London, COL. SHIRLEY explained, recognized early in the emergency that failure of communications was & crucial bottleneck in m ilitary operations in Malaya The military power was there, but even when intelligence was adequate, this power could not be brought to bear at the right time and place for lack of communications of the necessary range and quality. COL. SHIRLEY, as a communications engineer and operations-research specialist; was placed in charge of the team sent out to direct operations research in the Far East and, in particular, to apply its techniques to the study and improvement of communications in Malaya He was told in advance that; t0 the extent that proposed solutions required equip- ment; the only acceptable suggestions would be those involving existing and avail- able material. Plans for more advanced radio and other communications equipment were then under way, but off-the-shelf solutions were needed until the time, about three years thence, when such new equipment would actually be available to the forces in the field. On arrival in Malaya COL. SHIRLEY found that the forces were trying, unsuc cessfully in many instances, t0 operate well outside the range of their equipment: The battalions were using high-frequency (HF) equipment; although, by the end of World War II, the British had followed the Americans in switching to the very high frequencies (VHF), where interference from other stations and from atmos- pheric disturbances did not occur; but which depended, on the other hand; on the unbroken, undivided direct ray: This last factor had proved to be severely limiting to the use of VHF in Malaya, because the trees and rough terrain immediately screened it The m ilitary, therefore, had fallen back on the heavy and unwieldy HF equipment_difficult to tune and with very low power output- ~ that had been discarded toward the end of the war: Surprisingly enough, the infantry signalers, who were not specialists and might have been expected to have difficulty operating these sets at other than very short range, had so masterminded their operation (with the use of wire aerials) that were able to communicate by morse code (cw) over a distance of 50 t0 60 long they 110 COUNTERINSURGENCY : A SYMPOSIUM miles Because the groundwave range in the Malayan terrain was only on the order of a mile Of S0, they had resorted to the skywave (indirect Iay), and had managed the seemingly impossible feat of getting their signals through (a8 shown in though had yet to devise the most efficient system of doing it: The biggest handicap was having t0 halt in ordef to communicate; for you could not move in the jungle with a long antenna nor get enough radiation from a set without one. A patrol, therefore,; had to stop and prepare the set before he could signal, which might delay & report from minutes to hours; if caught in a firing engagement; he would have no means of feporting until the fight Was over Ionosphere (E layer) 2 1 8 8 Battalion headquarters Company headquarters 20 miles FIG. 4_The Use of Skywave in Communications in Malaya COL SHIRLEY and his team devoted themselves to finding the optimum work- frequency for this skywave method of communication. Although the British manuals at the time were basing their guidance for skywave on use of the F layer of the ionosphere, several hundred miles UP, the grOup was able to show, on the basis of ionosphere soundings made at the University of Singapore, that the losses suffered through having to send a ray the much greater distance to the F region considerably outweighed those resulting from the use of a lower frequency, which existed in Malaya during the daytime in the E layer, at & height of only about 80 miles (Since all traffic and operations in this theater occurred during the the limitation of the E to the daytime hours Was not & very serious one:) The Fig: 4), they ing day, region INTELLIGENCE AND COUNTERINTELLIGENCE (II) 111 suggestion that the E layer be substituted for the F layer of the ionosphere was adopted for Malaya and eventually incorporated in the signals manuals as well A by-product of the work on optimum frequencies was the realization that; regardless of how the direction from battalion to company headquarters to scat- tered patrols might appear from the ground, with the use of skywave their signals to each other were going within an arc So close to the vertical that it was actually possible to use directional radio techniques by which to beam the signals vertically. Having decided against the use of the basically much better groundwave (a dangerous decision, but made inevitable by the nature of the terrain),and given the fact that battalion and company headquarters tended to remain fixed for weeks and months, the research team recommended that these headquarters use a very broadly directional antennna, simple and cheap to construct with available material. COL SHIRLEY chose as adequate for the purpose two half-waves, which gave an immedi- ate of 4 or 5 decibels This solution, in response t0 a situation that had never before confronted a communications engineer, met with considerable skepticism; but it worked so well that it was adopted throughout Malaya, where eventually it was improved by an antenna substituting two full waves for the two half-waves: Another weakness the operations-research group examined was the frequent failure of the communicators to get their signals through even with adequate equipment and skill The most prevalent cause of failure turned out to be the fact that the unsuccessful patrol was on & frequency just slightly different from that of headquarters - a situation easy tO correct once it had been identified. The military in Malaya had elected not to change frequencies daily, as has to be done in many theaters for the sake of security. They preferred to operate for the duration on a single frequency (not necessarily the one assigned by Singapore or Kuala Lumpur but usually at least near it), which operators and monitors knew intimately (includ- the interference to be expected on it), and which lessened the chance of the operators' shifting onto wrong frequencies COL SHIRLEY s group did not discourage this practice, for the enemy, as already mentioned, either was not intercepting these communications O, if he was, failed to take advantage of any intelligence SO received.. Had there been evidence to the contrary, the advantages of the system would obviously have had to be weighed carefully against its benefits to the other side But; COL. SHIRLEY warned, it is easy to misinterpret evidence and to credit enemy intelligence with elaborate achievements for which there may be simpler explanations You have to look very closely at the enemy $ capabilities, therefore, making sure that they are in fact due to interception; t0 avoid the costly mistake of spoiling a gain ing good 112 COUNTERINSURGENCY: A SYMPOSIUM communications system out of what may be an unwarranted concern over security: The proper tuning of radio sets always remained a problem in time and again,a pilot On a supply-dropping mission, in spite of signals both ways, would fail to receive the message from the ground for which he was listening, simply because the ground set was a kilocycles away 0n another frequency- COL SHIRLEY and his group unsuccessfully suggested that the entire system be switched to crystal control, which would have obviated the tuning difficulty: The proposal was turned down, partly because of the tremendous number of crystals that would have been needed to support such an operation, but mainly for fear that; being locked inflexibly o one frequency, and unable to slip to either side of it at the communicators might find themselves without a usable channel if, for example, were drowned out unexpectedly by & high-powered Malayan or Chinese station: Aside from making the most of the disadvantageous situation that precluded the use of VHF (by choosing the best possible frequencies and introducing the simple and cheap antennas already mentioned), the operations-research group looked into the problem of antennas in general The jungle patrols were resource- ful in devising the most varied techniques by which to the wires out above the trees Some used quarter-wave antennas; some, half-wave; some, three-quarter- wave. There were different theories also about the most desirable angle at which to point the aerial, though, as COL. SHIRLEY $ group Was able tO show, the use of the skywave made the orientation of the antenna quite unimportant Given a free choice, and especially if they were using some groundwave as well, the patrols were advised, for maximum radiation, to their antenna at right to the direction in which they were trying to communicate On the whole, however; no major solutions to the antenna problem were found, and no significant changes introduced, as a result of these research efforts. The troops did not take to the idea of using target-marking balloons t0 raise their antennas, for fear that these might give their positions away: Although the strung aerials that continued to use worked well enough, there is much room for fesearch, COL SHIRLEY believes, into the question of just how much would be gained in strength of transmission by elevating the antenna to the maximum height to which the troops are physically able to raise it The rest of the team's effort was directed toward the design of equipment with a form factor better suited to the operation in Malaya than the heavy and awkward World War II radio sets that were then being used. COL. SHIRLEY was able to look at some excellent light and compact American sets that were being Malaya; good few will, they sling point angles low- they INTELLIGENCE AND COUNTERINTELLIGENCE (II) 113 designed at the time. But being VHF equipment; were not usable over the large distances in Malaya, where the rugged terrain made it impossible to build and, if necessary, to defend the relay stations that would have been required. In Kenya, by contrast, though the distances were comparable, it was possible to use VHF Much of the activity there took place outside the jungle, the high points On the rolling terrain were often accessible by road and hence suitable spots for relay stations, and police stations, which were nearly always on high ground and had radio communications, could be used as temporary radio head- quarters from which, with antennas sufficiently raised, VHF was made to work Even here; however, the British had difficulty finding suitable, horizontally direc- tional, antennas among their own combat VHF equipment at that time, and eventually were able to obtain these only from America Finally, in a severely limiting factor,and a problem never fully solved, was the supply of batteries and power for the radio sets The infantry were per- suaded to carry batteries in their packs In addition, there were larger; heavier batteries for higher powered, more reliable sets Unless it was possible to resupply batteries by air, however, transmission and reception time had to be to the minimum necessary to make the batteries last (Air supply became easier as the war went on.) The few generators available were most unpopular with the troops because of the strain of carrying and pedaling them In a special cases small gasoline generators were dropped into the jungle by helicopter: (CAPT: JBAPES, to COL. SHIRLEY $ surprise, had never received or even seen one of these, though he had had occasion to admire the American model) A British generator that was fired by wood and could produce enough watts for & lower powered set was devised during World War II but never reached Malaya; and an idea for using thermoelec tric power was not developed: The solution of the power-supply problem, COL. SHIRLEY thought; might lie in the much-publicized development by the United States of a generator fired by propane (presumably also by wood, if necessary), which could produce a few hun- dred watts 55 enough, that is, for the communications requirements of any counter- insurgency operation S and would have the virtue, above all, of being absolutely silent: Although these generators would not be light; would obviously be far superior to anything the British were compelled to use in Malaya and Kenya Unlike the British in the Malayan and Kenya campaigns, the Americans believe in crystal control. According t0 CAPT: JEAPES, their Special Forces are equipped with crystal sets today; and COL. FERTIG told of using crystals in the they Malaya, dry kept pedal few, they 114 COUNTERINSURGENCY: A SYMPOSIUM Philippines throughout World War II, chiefly for lack of personnel that could tune other sets accurately. As for power supply, COL FERTIG recalled, the troops in the Philippines had some success with a steam generator that worked best when it could be fired on straight coconut shell (its firebox being too small for anything else) Mainly, how- ever, the forces benefited by the fact that International Harvester; some time before the war, had brought in large numbers of $ to 7 horsepower single-cylinder engines that drove a generator (with even a built-in radio-noise suppressor) This self contained unit; which ran on any kind of fuel available, could be turned into a small powerplant, and it became the main source of power despite the fact that it required two strong men to carry one set The available gas generators were useless for lack of gas (They would not run 0 alcohol.) The best generators for continual rugged use in the tropical climate turned out to be a few World War I models that had been sold to the Japanese as and recaptured from them in World War II Batteries were a great problem in the Philippines, as was all equipment that came off the shelves and had not been designed for the tropics Most communica- tions problems were solved by the fortuitous arrival of a medical officer who turned out to be an ingenious ham operator and was placed in charge of the signal section: Thereafter, portable sending sets were built o the spot; on small boards, from tubes, coils, and crystals that had been shipped in. Another lucky break was the fact that every municipality in COL. FERTIG' $ area had been equipped before the war with a fine Phillips tropic-proof all-band receiver, which, though heavy to carry, was very rugged, packed easily, and worked beautifully: As for high-wattage units fof central stations, the best 100-watt set available the so-called suitcase set that could be charged o almost any voltage had been designed specifically for Europe (and was therefore not to be issued through chan- nels to any other theater); but it had been possible to steal" some of these sets in Washington and have them brought into Manila with the frst penetracion party. Like other American army equipment not built for the tropics, their cases had to be waterproofed at once with varnish Or wax and then as cool as possible COL. SHIRLEY, in & final comment on his own and COL. FERTIG S account of the technical inadequacies of equipment; pointed out that many of these shortcomings had meanwhile been corrected: The HF tuning problem, for example, does not exist with the newest sets, which have all the advantages of easy, accurate tuning of the crystal-control set, without the disadvantage of rigid confinement tO a limited number of fixed frequencies There are also available today sets no larger surplus kept INTELLIGENCE AND COUNTERINTELLIGENCE (II) 115 or heavier than the old half-watt sets but of putting out over 100 watts: Having a large number of fairly high-powered sets operating in a single coun- try (for example, in Vietnam) does, of course, increase the likelihood of inter- ference among the various groups But this problem can be solved partly through wise frequency selection and the use of proper directional antennas; in addition, it will require discipline and training to keep air messages to minimum verbiage and thereby permit the largest possible number of operators to share a single frequency without undue interference The SAS in Malaya, CAPT: JEAPES reported, had found the British army sets unsatisfactory and had chosen instead the Foreign Office set used by FO agents, the Marconi 182, a heavy, crystal-controlled set with a pedal generator: Today, there is an entire range of very sets available, especially the ANGRY 109 used by the American forces and, still better because lighter to carry, the 128 British Foreign Office set that the SAS is using The PRC-10 has proved excellent for communications between detachments; and has only recently been used in Alaska (CAPT. JEAPES had no experience of how it might work in the jungle ) Another British set is the A-40, with a built-in whisper device that allows a whispered message to come out loud and clear at the other end Voice-level requirements, COL SHIRLEY commented, have always been a matter 0f some dis- pute: The operators' complaint that their voices threatened to give their positions away was met to some extent by the introduction of rubber mouthpieces In contrast to earlier speakers, COL GALULA in Algeria had faced few com- munications problems The French forces took advantage of the existence of a strong civil network, which they had little trouble keeping open and in There was very little sabotage and none of the battle fof telephone lines that COL GALULA had witnessed, for example, in North China Given the terrain, and the dense network of fixed stations, the transmitters had no diffculty using VHF, their only problems being a perennial shortage of sets and the time it took t0 send a defective one to division headquarters for repairs Eventually, the shortage of radio sets,and also of batteries, was relieved through increased production at home MR HOSMER's final question on communications regarded the village Or out- post alarm system; such a system called, he thought, for a fairly simple device that warmed up and worked instantly and was able t0 give sufficient information about the nature and extent of the threat COL GALULA described as very successful the transmitter used in Algeria, which, at the pressing of a button, sent an impulse that activated a light O rang a "COL BOHANNAN, having had extensive experience with the PRC-1O at Ft.

BOHANNAN, were not fortunate enough to have & device of that kind available to them. In the Philippines, where made do with war-surplus "Gibson Girls;' and also in Vietnam, such a simple alarm system would have been warmly welcomed: An adequate alarm device, in MR RUTKOWSKI's opinion; must meet three requirements It must be simple and fast for the sender t0 operate; there has to be a clear indication at the receiving center as to which signal post is transmitting; and it must be possible to test the set at regular intervals Even with a satisfactory alarm system of this kind, however, there will always be the serious problem of false alarms, which might be met if one were able to spot in advance the villages and posts likely to be in trouble and thus could feel safe in ignoring signals from others (In Algeria, it appeared, the enemy never caught on to the existence of the signaling system, and there were no false alarms:) MR RUTKOWSKI strongly believed that the least complex device was the most desirable, and warned against becoming tied up in a development program for gadgetry that was not really essential for the purpose (such as scramblers for voice communicators used by patrols) MR ELLIS' suggestion that you might complicate 2 signal device in order to get more specific information across for example, the same button twice in order to signal danger - ~ was precisely the kind of complexity that MR RUTKOWSKI thought inadvisable There followed a discussion of the merits of the large and bulkily mounted transmitter, which the enemy cannot easily carry off, over the small, easily hidden clandestine device: CAPT. JEAPES (in principle an advocate of the use of radio or telephone wherever possible) stressed the virtues of at least a one-way transmitter that will permit the sender to furnish details about the reported danger: But; he conceded; in a black area where many people are friendly to the enemy, the man who is to give the alarm or information must have the most inconspicuous set for the sake of his own safety, though preferably still one that allows him to pass on a limited amount of information; and, in a black village where he may be the informer; even the simplest warning device, indicating only that 'something is going to happen;' may have t0 suffice (the more S0, COL. GALULA pointed out, as the 'privacy' in which one has to operate a clandestine machine is a fare com- modity in Asia) The situation is different in a cleared area, relatively free of the enemy, they push only INTELLIGENCE AND COUNTERINTELLIGENCE (IL) 117 where there is no need for a clandestine gadget; and a case can be made, in the opinion of MR GREENE and MR RUTKOWSKI, for the larger device as part of the general fortification of the area In that situation, CAPT: JBAPES wondered, would not radio, with the possibility of voice exchange, be far preferable to a button- pushing, light-fashing device that did not enable you to give any particulars of the danger signaled? Even in a black area, COL. VALERIANO added, it has been possible to report an untoward happening through the surveillance party with a radio set operating unsuspected by any of the villagers COL. BOHANNAN praised the twenty-year-old "Gibson Girl" as being ade- quate, with slight modifications, fof the basic requirements of a security alarm system; since it was also cheap and apparently still available, he felt that it should be procured and used pending the development of & more suitable gadget He cited simplicity of operation, ruggedness, and absence of a resupply problem (that is, operation by generator rather than battery) as essential features of a suitable radio_ MR ELLIS pointed out; however; that a modern improved counterpart of the "Gibson Girl" _ smaller, lighter, and procurable in large quantities- 3 was nOw part of the air-sea rescue kit of the U.S. Air Force: The technology of a village alarm device, MR RUTKOWSKI concluded,is at the most a secondary problem; the crucial question is what happens at the end where the message is feceived. For without the facilities and procedures for instant action, a signal system quickly becomes worthless COL VALERIANO, fully alert to that problem, had evolved an elaborate; and apparently very successful, standard procedure in his area Of command in the Philippines, which he now described in some detail. All the large towns in the area maintained regular telephone contact with battalion headquarters Against the possibility that the Huks might cut telephone wires, and because they invariably attacked at night; the local defense forces were equipped with flares and kites, whose working condition was periodically tested by detachments Also, COL.' VALERIANO had sporadic test runs to show just how fast a mobile reserve could rush from the camp to the point of contact; and how promptly the local defenders could attack from the other side. The cutting of telephone lines might herald either an attack on the town or an ambush of reinforcements, and the troops had to prepare to meet the Huks from both directions: Throughout the night, beginning with the 4:00 P.M. change-over to the new officer of the and working by a strict timetable, officers or other members of the guard would call up the various telephone contacts at specified times special day, 118 COUNTERINSURGENCY: 4 SYMPOSIUM Whenever one failed to answer, a scout Or armored car would be dispatched; it was preceded, however; by the sO-called honeymoon team: an enlisted man and a woman agent, disguised as peasants and traveling in a dilapidated civilian vehicle as though late returning from market; who thus blended naturally into local landscape and customs: As the pattern of the Huk ambush included 2 sig- naler at each end of the ambush zone, the woman of the team was trained tO look backward If she noted a signal behind she would flash the alarm as soon as she and her companion reached the next town; if there was no sign Of trouble, the scout car could safely proceed and be followed by the telephone repair truck: As another part of the standard operating procedure, and an effective counter- check on the routine just described, any town that failed to its telephone signal at the appointed time would send out shooting fares, which were relayed by intelligence teams hidden throughout the area and equipped with radio sets Needless to say , an automatic alarm system of the kind described earlier would greatly have facilitated the task, especially for the remoter spots, and COL VALERIANO admitted having 'dreamed about one. COL. SHIRLEY pointed out that each scenario called for a different support program: Given the inevitable limitations in funds, and therefore the need for priorities, one area commander might request simple voice transmitters above all else, another would want to put available money into tighter military controls, a third would wish to have more in the way of orthodox communications for the central villages and perhaps some simple gadgets fof the smaller ones, and SO on. In Malaya, for example, police and wire communications were relatively good (if the rebels cut the wires, as did almost nightly, this had the advan- tage of helping the defending forces to spot them), and no request for an auto- matic alarm system was ever put forward: On the other hand; the very simple voice alarm system that COL. SHIRLEY tended to favor- Set comparable to the "Gibson Girl" in cheapness and operating on one frequency would not be difficult to design, and would afford the opportunity to pass on limited information if time permitted. CAPT. JEAPES argued strongly for the merits of such & system as com- to the automatic push-button set advocated by COL. GALULA; wherever a voice system was available in Malaya, he had found planters reporting information between rounds in the midst of a firing engagement There was general agreement with MR HOSMER as to the importance of reaching the trouble spot in time to save the man under attack COL. BOHANNAN her, get they pared INTELLIGENCE AND COUNTERINTELLIGENCE (II) 119 pointed out; however; that there is psychological value to be derived from the very fact that the troops begin acting instantly, even though may not always arrive in time COL SHIRLEY added that the enemy, knowing that the defending forces have communications and are on their way, will often be prompted to clear out in advance of the troops' arrival, which amounts to an indirect military for the counterinsurgent side and can be an important factor in the general tive of keeping a war at the guerrilla level: COL. VALERIANO then a detailed account of an incident that took place in a area near his battalion headquarters, an excellent illustration of the functioning of the communications system he had described earlier: (See 5.) At the time of the incident, although the army had regained control of Small municipal center Jungle and mountains Local civil defense forces 'Honeymoon team spots danger Honeymoon team Scout car Telephone repair truck Road Area of small settlements BC T within sight of each other Battalion headquarters FIG. 5_ An Alarm-signaling System in the Philippines they gain objec- gave typical Fig town, River 120 COUNTERINSURGENCY: A SYMPOSIUM the town and villages shown in the figure, the Huks were continuing to harass these settlements, chiefly because they had once been & center of supply activities At the fecommendation of his civil affairs officer, COL VALERIANO had assigned one of his best sergeants and a PFC to organizing and training a civilian guard of about men, including both police and armed civilians, as the area's local defense force One night at 1l.4S battalion headquarters found the telephone connection to the municipal center to have been cut, presaging either a Huk attack on the town and villages or an ambush o the reinforcements that the enemy expected to be dispatched along the road to town: Simultaneously with the discovery at headquarters, the people in town who failed to receive the scheduled call sent up a blue flare (blue being the code that indicated "line cut; but danger not immi- nent" ) , and this signal was picked up and relayed to headquarters by individuals in each settlement whose job it was to watch in the direction of the town: The honeymoon team, followed by the scout Car; was promptly sent out in the standard manner: Before reaching the second bend in the road, the man and woman, noticing lights by the side of the road that betrayed the presence of Huks at that natural ambush site, stopped their Own vehicle and the scout team behind them Meanwhile, the sergeant with his local defense force near the town, on the far side of the trouble spOt; having seen no movement on the perimeter of the town, suspected (correctly) that the enemys plan was to attack the rein- forcements rather than the town: Leaving behind only a small contingent of de- fenders, he marched most of the fifty-odd civilians and police down the road and caught the ambushers from the rear, killing nine of the thirty-six Huks in the party. This and similar incidents convinced COL. VALERIANO that; so long as have 2 fast-working communications system, primitive though it may and an efficient SOP that enables the troops to take instant action in response to a threat; the civilians in turn will willingly and spontaneously act in their own defense: Moreover; the very existence of such a system acts as a deterrent to the enemy. Once the Huks in COL VALERIANO' $ sector caught on to the mere fact that there was a system, they ceased their activities, and the area became so dull that it could safely be left with only one motorized company. The company com- mander had his men throw occasional flares, for no reason other than to confuse the enemy and make him assume the presence of larger forces Whether or not were deceived by this, the Huks never exploited the absence of the battalion: In the setting just described, visible flares had obviously been adequate, fifty keep you be, they INTELLIGENCE AND COUNTERINTELLIGENCE (II) 121 as might be, in a different theater, the even simpler Indian smoke signal. COL. FERTIG mentioned as still another alternative the use of a gong, properly coded, in certain non-Christian countries where gongs were part of the local color: But COL BOHANNAN, for one, could conceive of situations where these primitive methods would not be usable, or where it would require too elaborate an organ- ization t0 make them reliable In answer to a question from MR. HOSMER about the reaction procedures of the Japanese against the guerrillas in the Philippines, COL. FERTIG reported that; at least in the early part of the occupation, the Japanese small units (part of a special group trained on Formosa for jungle warfare) were exceptionally well provided with communication equipment (much better than the fest of the Japanese army), and the reaction time of these voice-equipped units was extremely fast: The home-guard forces that were moved in from Japan later on were not nearly so well trained and equipped, and it was important for the OppOS- ing side to time its attacks in terms of what kind of Japanese unit it was facing COL. FERTIG recalled one particular fre fght; carefully based on the calculation that the enemy' s reaction time was somewhere between twelve and fourteen minutes, in which his unit succeeded in killing all the enemy and getting out of the area again within precisely eight minutes COL. SHIRLEY, answering a question about the current state of the art with respect to lighrweight transmitters using transistors, explained that such microminiature transmitters have indeed been developed. They are not in production on a large scale, but the Signal has them experimentally: No bigger than a man' $ the smallest version will fit into a helmet;, the batteries needed for the transistors are very small, and the over-all performance is com- parable to that of the full man-load of radio equipment carried by the British in Malaya The biggest snag with this highly miniaturized" gadget is its pIO- hibitive cost: In principle, COL: SHIRLEY was opposed to the expensive and complicated gadget wherever a cheap, simple, and robust one would meet the essential need; he repeated his plea for the simple voice transmitter without receiver (but with a receiver counterpart for situations demanding a receiving capability) working on a single frequency, possibly combined with an automatic alarm device, wherever the scenario afforded it the necessary range It would not work across mountains or in rain-forest country unless the tricky HF skywave were But in the Mekong Delta, for example, with its relatively flat terrain and a considerable number of central command posts, such & transmitter should be quite adequate for tiny, yet Corps fist, used. 122 COUNTERINSURGENCY: A SYMPOSIUM the range needed to get the signal through to the nearest control center: At a very tentative guess, it would cost no more than $100, and possibly as little as $50 if produced in large quantities COL. VALERIANO asked to be permitted a few final words on the subject of gadgets He had hit almost by chance on the use of the paraffin test; which detects powder residue on a man 's hands, and thereafter had made paraffin test kits part of his battalion's regular equipment: After an ambush, when the ambush- ers seemed to have vanished into thin air; and there was thus reason to suspect that they had simply merged with the people of nearby villages, COL VALERIANO would enclose an area within a large radius of the ambush site and would subject every male inhabitant within it_O, if this was not feasible, every fifth one in the presence of all others to the paraffin test: Many were caught in this manner, and the number of ambushes declined markedly. The Philippine army, and also the people at Ft Bragg, have been skeptical of the test; partly because a positive showing is not scientifically valid of guilt It is true, said COL. VALERIANO, that an enemy commander who tells every man to urinate on his hands before being tested can beat the device, because everyone will show up positive Even then, however; the test may have some psychological value, for the truly guilty man, on being found positive, is apt to start talking Another of COL VALERIANO's suggestions that the army s0 far seems reluctant to has been for some kind of light mortar shell, which, when aimed in the direction of a guerrilla force in the woods, will cover everyone in the area with an odorless, colorless dye, quickly detectable under ultraviolet light: (The British apparently did try & similar experiment in Malaya, but COL SHIRLEY could not recall its outcome ) COL. VALERIANO thought the matter well worth investigating in view of the returns, real and psychological, that such simple, inexpensive, and quickly administered tests could yield. proof adopt APRIL 20, 1962, A.M:* BRITISH CAMPAIGN IN KENYA; SELECTION OF PERSONNEL FOR COUNTERINSURGENCY; SPECIAL ROLE OF THE ADVISOR Background and Causes of tbe Emergency in Kenya Tbe Problems and Tasks of a Britisb Offcer Developing "Contact" Information from Low-level Intelligence: A Defense of tbe Principle and & Description of Metbods Turning a Mau Mau into & Counterrebel: Tbe Carrot-and-Stick Approacb; Trickery and Deception (tbe "Pseudo- gang"); Propaganda Tecbniques in an Illiterate Society; Exploiting tbe Role of Magic and Superstition Resettlement in Kenya Food Control The Ambusb An Appraisal of tbe Role and Limitations of Aircraft for Bombing, Reconnaissance, and Supply in Tbe Negligible Value of Minor Tactical Devices and "Gimmicks" against tbe African Native The Effectiveness of Various Weapons Destruction of tbe Mau Mau Subply System: Tbe Military Turning Point of tbe War ~ A Variety of Views on tbe Task of Choosing Personnel for Counterinsurgent Warfare: Tbe Difficulty of Gauging Aptitude by Conventional Screening Metbods; tbe Cbance Factors Tbat Determine Success or Failure The Unique Role of tbe Foreign Advisor: Tbe Limita- tions under Wbicb He Operates, and tbe Special Background, Attitudes , and Metbods Needed for His Task MR HOSMER introduced LT.

As the guerrilla's aim is not sO much to defeat the other side in battle (at least not until the final of the war) as to win control of the population (using small numbers of people to get at the larger group), the counterinsurgent; to combat him, must in turn achieve direct contact with the population: To this end he must first assemble the background intel- ligence and then develop it to the point where it becomes what the British call (( contact information;' that is to Say, information that permits him to put his troops in contact with small numbers of the enemy. Developing the available information is the main tactical job of the company and battalion commander; aided by the 66 'special forces;' with their specialized knowledge and techniques. The So-called emergency in Kenya differed in several respects from other cases of terrorist warfare Although the country as a whole occupies a territory of 300 by 400 miles, the febellion itself was confined to a sector about 100 by 60 miles (extending from Nairobi northward for roughly 80 miles) Within this small sec- tion (an area not much larger than Cyprus), the number of terrorists L= 15,000 at the height of the rebellion S was far greater than the 400 or so on Cyprus, and larger even than the 8000 to 11,000 rebels that operated at various times in Malaya, a country many times the size of the site of the Mau Mau rebellion Though the war in Kenya was shorter than in Malaya or Cyprus, it was more concentrated and vio- lent; in the less than four years it lasted (1952-1955), 12,000 people are known to have been killed and many more disappeared. Physically, it is high plateau country (5000 feet), with two major mountain ranges- St the Aberdares, running north-south and rising up to 15,000 and the circular Mt Kenya range with elevations as high as 17,000 feet: Heavily wooded slopes and the generally craggy countryside make the terrain as difficult to traverse as the Malayan jungle: Only one of the twenty tribes in Kenya the Kikuyu, with a tribal population of two-and-a-half million S# was involved in the rebellion; thus, it was essentially a civil war between the loyal and disloyal factions in this tribe; which also involved the European community living o the edge of the tribal area With the country divided into provinces, and these in turn into districts, the method of government followed the normal British colonial pattern: a governor at the topP, and the provincial and district commissioners below him (the district commissioner, who is comparable to the district officer in Malaya, controlling an area about the size of a large English county) phase feet, BRITISH KENYA CAMPAIGN AND PERSONNEL FOR COUNTERINSURGENCY 125 Security forces were (a) the district commissioners forces (home guard and tribal police); (6) the regular uniformed police (plus their ununiformed criminal ( investigation units and the 'special branch" intelligence-collecting organization); and (c) the armed forces, consisting of both the East African army (African soldiers with European-British officers) and the British imperial troops (that is, regiments from England) The main cause of the Mau Mau rebellion, in COL. KITSON'$ eyes, was the dis- content and bitterness of men such as Jomo Kenyatta, who had been educated abroad far beyond the level to which could hope,at that time,to rise when they returned to the colony. Intensely nationalistic themselves, incited the people to indignation and revolt over a bogus issue (they assected, quite falsely, that land had been stolen from the Kikuyu), skillfully interweaving the movement with ele- ments of a spiritualistic cult that appealed strongly to the African natives The original leaders were picked up by the British early in the emergency, leaving the movement without spiritual guidance and with an inferior group of men directing the actual fighting The active of the Mau Mau was the force of actual gangs that were based in the forests (about 10,000 during most of the rebellion, but up to 15,000 at its height, and no more than about 3000 toward the end) Organized into units resem- bling battalions, companies, and platoons, they tended to live in groups of about 100, which might combine with one another to & strength of 400 o1 500 for a par- ticular operation: As the movement lost ground, these groups became more and more fragmented. Support of the active came from what might (inappropriately) be called ({ the 'passive wing"' organizations: people living in and around the native reserves and towns, and very efficiently organized into committees at the various adminis trative levels (district; location, and village) These committees, of eight Or nine members each, would be responsible for the collection of food, money, arms, and ammunition, and fof the general indoctrination of the population On whose ready assistance the gangs were dependent The gangs themselves concentrated on putting down resistance among their own people (hence a "civil" war), attacking those among the Kikuyu who were not supporting the movement, that is, mainly the home and any individuals Or missions that were influencing the populace against taking part in the rebellion: They tended to leave the European farmers alone, and fought only those European troops that found in very small numbers or became unavoidably entangled with: The security forces fighting the Mau Mau were largely (about 75 per cent) they they only wing wing guard they 126 COUNTERINSURGENCY: A SYMPOSIUM Kikuyu home guard; there were never more than six British battalions in Kenya at any one time Itt a situation very different from Malaya, where great numbers of troops were involved. The Mau Mau depended on the population for money, supplies, and informa- tion, and were prepared from the outset to stage large attacks ~= two to three hundred Mau Mau might storm a single police station or home-guard post ~= to kill resisters and acquire arms, often with a tremendous death toll: Counteraction required, above all, intelligence on the rebels and their fol- lowers, and collecting the information was the task of the Police Special Branch, which at the beginning of the emergency consisted of little more than a dozen men (Europeans and a few African inspectors) in the entire country: COL. KITSON was one of the British army officers sent out to join and assist them, and his experiences and methods are illustrative of the problems encountered and the tactics used to meet them To start with, COL. KITSON was assigned a district that constituted about a quar- ter or one-fifth of the total operational area_ There, together with the Special Branch officer (who was aided by two African inspectors), and assisted by a Euro- pean settlers son, he began by collecting oly overt intelligence, driving around the area to the sites of any incidents and passing on to the district commissioner all the facts observed or gathered. Talking to prisoners through African interpreters turned out t0 be quite useless for lack of the background information needed to evaluate the truth of statements and to know what questions to ask: In the next phase, COL; KITSON obtained valuable help from sons of European settlers, nine- teen- and twenty-year-olds who went to live in the reserves: Knowing both the language and the Kikuyu themselves so intimately, were able to talk with the prisoners easily and without an interpreter, and thus obtained a great deal of addi- tional overt intelligence: In starting to develop contact information from these data, the British were greatly helped by the chance acquisition of documents (including one that had probably belonged to a Mau Mau killed in battle, which gave the minutest details on all the members ofone gang, down to their rifle numbers) Thereafter,a prisoner could be trapped. in an untruth and broken down by being confronted with the interrogator $ knowledge of his identity and history. One Mau Mau prisoner, super- stitious as most natives are, concluded that this was magic , and turned into a trusted and invaluable informer: Having obtained information on the main gang, he led a small group of it into an ambush, and then, together with some local Africans and a few British soldiers dressed up as Mau Mau, infiltrated the larger group: they they BRITISH KENYA CAMPAIGN AND PERSONNEL FOR COUNTERINSURGENCY 127 The success of these tactics, which were limited to a single informer and the operations of one gang, pointed the way to the system eventually established Growing numbers of informers produced the background information, which COL KITSON and his men, and similar organizations in other areas, then developed and passed 0n, through the local District Emergency Committee, to whatever troops needed it: Only occasionally would use the information themselves for direct contact with the enemy. The typical British battalion Or company commander's common complaint that he did not have any information was based, COL. KITSON felt;on his misconception of the nature of obtainable intelligence in a guerrilla situation He counted on the intelligence staff to hand him precise advance knowledge of enemy movements and strikes- ~ an impossible feat in this type of war: He should, instead, have used whatever data the intelligence organization could furnish him as only a beginning, and then gone on to develop his Own, more valuable intelligence from the mass of data fully known Or accessible to him: For example, by reviewing past movements and actions of the gangs he was fighting, learning some of their tribal customs, etc, he could have established certain patterns of behavior and operations and, after checking his theories against simple tangible evidence (such as tracks in the forest), could have put his patrols out selectively, rather than send them out at random Of have them scour huge forest areas For a comprehensive intelligence system in counterguerrilla warfare, then, you must have not only the information collected by the special forces organiza- tion, with its few experienced and reliable agents, who might penetrate even' the enemy high command, but also the mass of low-level data provided by large num- bers of low-grade sources Many of these will be unreliable, but all of them together can furnish the mosaic in which the patterns ofenemy activities become discernible: In building up such a network, is of the essence, even at the expense of qual- and accuracy of agents and their information; the screening and sorting out can come later: This principle, though still regarded as heresy in some quarters, is gradually being accepted. COL FERTIG strongly agreed with COL. KITSON's last statements and cited his own difficulty in convincing military commanders that; in addition to top agents, need bar girls, cab drivers,and the like to provide the background information He felt that these methods had never really been accepted by the Americans, though theic results were acknowledged Turning to specifics, COL. KITSON considered first MR. HOSMER'$ question as to how he had gone about turning & captured Mau Mau into a countergangster: they speed ity you 128 COUNTERINSURGENCY: A SYMPOSIUM The first step is tO find out the Mau Mau, or for that matter the communist cebel in Malaya and Indochina, has turned guerrilla In nine out of ten cases, the reason is that his friends are in the movement, Or simply that he is young and likes the sport and the loot Only the tenth man will be the dyed-in-the-wool nationalist or Communist You have & chance to win over the other nine if you can give them some adventure and perhaps a little loot, if you satisfy their basic needs, and,above all, if you can put them together with some of their friends (it is always much more difficult to win the first man than the fiftieth) Next; you must convince the rebel thar you are the power, and that his alternative to cO-operation is execution Of at least imprisonment: In short; use the carrot-and-stick method. Another counterguerrilla technique (as pointed out by MR HOSMER) , which was immensely successful in Kenya, was to build up suspicion among the rebels to the point where no gang trusted the next one for fear that it might be a pseudo- gang, and the rebels began shooting one another: In one of many similar instances, a small pseudogang succeeded in killing a large number of gangsters they had met simply by pretending to suspect them of being countergangsters and insisting on tying up and searching them for " incriminating evidence before accepting them as bona fide rebels: To allow a company commander to be fully effective in these operations, and to exploit the situation he has built up in his area, COL. KITSON believes it is very important not to move him Or his unit too soon and too frequently. BRIG. POWELL-JONES concurred in this statement and re-emphasized the ciple, formulated earlier in the discussions, that you should clear up one spot entirely before going on to another: But he pointed out that pressure from the top to produce quick, spectacular successes, Or to clear up a given area by a given date as part of a larger program, was often responsible for premature withdrawal. Psychological warfare techniques (in answer to a question from MR. PHILLIPS) entered into the attempt to turn the Mau Mau against one another, though they were more likely to be called 'special operations' and were not handled by the official psychological warfare people: Nor were some of the established logical warfare methods, such as the distribution of propaganda leaflets, very useful where so many of the people were illiterate: Loudspeakers were effective at times, as when you wanted to tell terrorists who were cornered in a swamp that they were in fact trapped. More successful in getting to the rebels and sowing confusion and suspicion among them was the attempt to ascertain their courier system and inject { messages into it: (They had a very efficient network of "letter boxes;' which actually consisted of trees, cleft sticks, and similar landmarks where notes could be left) why you prin- psycho- BRITISH KENYA CAMPAIGN AND PERSONNEL FOR COUNTERINSURGENCY 129 In the main, the entire pseudogang approach may be said to have been based largely on trickery, and to some extent on the fact that even in dedicated causes there are always (as BRIG. POWELL-JONES put it) venal men, and that everyone and every secret had a price. Thus, low-grade information could often be tricked away by bribery, though there was not much point in accually posting rewards, as few would have been able to read the posters A more successful form oftrickery involved extremely elaborateand protracted operations, some of which did not pay off for months COL. KITSON cited examples: (1) In developing an area, his troops would find out the location of,say, four farms that were supplying the rebels with food, but would deliberately pick up only three of them, causing the Mau Mau to come to the fourth one more and more often and in growing numbers, to be eventually surrounded and caught (2) On moving into an area where an elusive gang was known to be operating, the troops pretended to be gangsters themselves and built the entire region up from the Mau Mau of view. They began by making contact with the passive supporting element; and eventually approached the gang itself. Once trust had been established, the pseudo- gang persuaded the genuine gang to come to joint meetings, on such pretexts as & conflict over poaching in each others area At the end of sometimes several such meetings, when all possible distrust had been allayed and the entire gang was assembled, the troops would close in (a dangerous maneuver, in which identities were sometimes confused and accidents happened) A phenomenon peculiar to the war in Kenya, as compared to the other guer- rilla warfare theaters discussed, was the role of magic. To this all of tribal Africa is dominated by magic, and the village witch doctor; far from being simply an evil man, is both priest and doctor; with tremendous influence One of his func- tions, and a major source of his income,is the administration of oaths, a very effec- tive means of controlling native behavior and approaching a system of justice: A man will not perjure himself under such an oath, for he is convinced that the witch doctor can decree & dreadful fate for him if he does To some extent; their primitive superstitions made the Mau Mau highly unpre- dictable and a more difficult problem for the British than terrorists elsewhere Whereas you could count on the Malayan Communists,for example,to act logically and according to plan (and you only needed to find out the plan in order t0 antici- pate them), the Mau Mau were inconsistent If the witch doctor declared that a certain night augured ill for a projected undertaking, it would be abandoned. Also, the terrorists used the power of the oath very effectively to bind together in secrecy; OI,in a sinister refinement of the method, would admin- they point day, people they 130 COUNTERINSURGENCY : A SYMPOSIUM ister it in ways that were taboo under tribal thereby pushing the sworn person outside the society (which was on the side of the government) beyond any chance of return. With time, the oath became a somewhat less powerful weapon, as the Mau Mau, pressed for money, resorted to readministering a single oath for the sake of the revenue. Also, captured prisoners, choosing between the death they feared from violating the oath of secrecy and a similar fate at the hands of the enemy if did not talk, might decide to spill a secret and then find out that the oath did not kill after all. The counterinsurgents usefully exploited the factor of magic, administering oaths themselves (for example, to establish the authenticity of a pseudogang), and hiring the very able village witch doctors; who were On the side of the authorities and whose services were for sale to any bidder; to do individual jobs, such as persuading a recalcitrant terrorist Of villager to talk. On MR GREENE s question about ways of isolating the Mau Mau from the population (fOr example, by putting fences and wire fortifications around villages) , COL. KITSON described the methods and the success of what became known in Kenya as "villagisation: The Kikuyu, a family-based tribe where normally mem- bers of one clan live in a group ofhuts that may be miles away from the next grOup, did not take readily to resettlement in villages,and many districtcommissioners and other administrators opposed the scheme as certain to drive people into the Mau Mau camp. But it was the only way of preventing food from getting to the terrorists, and, undertaken on a large scale, it proved very efficient BRIG. POWELL-JONES noted that in Malaya, too,the Chinese initially hated having to live in the reserves, but were quick to realize theif advantages, including schools for their chil- dren, and in most cases chose not to leave the reserve after were free to do sO In Algeria, according to COL. GALULA, the main support for resettlement had come from the women, who enjoyed the more varied social life of these villages Apart from putting moats around the villages, no serious attempt was made to ""fence in areas in which the Mau Mau were operating: COL. KITSON recalled the abortive effort to contain the rebels by clearing, at great expense, a half-mile strip around the jungle where were hiding, with the idea that any terrorist within that strip could be readily spotted and shot Within & yeaf, instead of the former primal forest; which is not totally impassable,the area had become dense secondary jungle, and the rebels benefited. Before the discussion turned to other aspects of the Kenya campaign, GEN. LANSDALE mentioned that COL. VALERIANO used something resembling COL KITSONs pseudogang technique in the Philippines. He Was, in fact, So successful that his methods passed over to the Asian mainland and were now being used law, they good they they only BRITISH KENYA CAMPAIGN AND PERSONNEL FOR COUNTERINSURGENCY 131 against communist guerrillas by local forces The participants agreed, however; that cross-fertilization of this kind was at best a slow process Even in Cyprus, COL: KITSON said, with counterguerrilla warfare going on simultaneously in Malaya and in those in charge were at first reluctant to adopt the lessons learned in the other two theaters, partly for fear of theif political repercussions BRIG. POWELL-JONES pointed out that the British in Malaya similarly derived little in the way of applicable lessons directly from the earlier experience of the French in Indochina, and instead built up their methods empicically and locally; not until units and commanding officers were brought in who had had experience in earlier counterinsurgency campaigns was there some degree of cross-fertilization. Asked by MR. HOSMER about the usefulness of aircraft in Keaya, COL. KITSON thought this varied greatly with the purpose of their mission Of the three main uses (bombing, reconnaissance, and supply), bomb though popular with headquarters, had been wasteful and ineffectual over the jungle The reaction of people being bombarded from the air was to leave the danger area if possible, but to stay if all adjacent areas were patrolled Bombing was very frightening to the terrorists, however, and was effective therefore in areas where there were no ground troops available to fight them: Even then, it had its drawbacks, including the fact that the jungle animals often went berserk with fear. Planes were very useful for aerial feconnaissance, on the other hand, and air photos were a great help in many instances Finally, air supply used in Kenya to a certain extent and sometimes effec- tively _ is a device that COL. KITSON nevertheless believes should be used very sparingly and only where there is no other way ofkeeping troops alive,for air will give positions away: Fitted into a tactical plan, can be an asset: Moreover (as suggested by BRIG. POWELL-JONES) , the availability of planes can do much for troop morale by assuring the men of quick evacuation from the jungle say, a medical emergency: Food control proved an effective weapon in Kenya and was widely used. The guarding of meat stock, in particular, was very rewarding, as the natives' religious conventions prevented them from killing and eating wild animals except in des- peration Grain, the second most important item, was more difficult to keep from the terrorists, as it was not stockpiled or brought in by train but was grown by the farmers for their own consumption On the other hand, knowing that the terrorists were likely to come to the farms to it helped the troops in planning ambushes MR. HOSMER suggested that COL KITSON elaborate on methods of ambushing and their success; he wondered whether the Mau Mau's heightened senses after a Kenya, drops, put drops they in, get 132 COUNTERINSURGENCY: A SYMPOSIUM period spent in the bush had noticeably complicated the problem for the troops COL. KITSON'$ comments: The only way to approach the tremendously difficult job of the ambush is to do it as well as possible, which necessitates unusual training and the ability to remain absolutely still in the face of any disturbance (be it from the enemy or from wild animals) It was not easy in Kenya to select the right people and give them the needed training, as compared,for example, with Malaya, where the British had the advantage of having many regular troops and well-organized special schools But even given these limitations of the defending forces and the keen sense of the natives, a Mau Mau would walk into & well-laid ambush On the other hand, when the ambushers failed to take the necessary precautions, including at times such obvious ones as not using SOap Or hair tonic; the Mau Mau would be immediately alerted Tracker as well as patrol were used in connection with the patrols and, surprisingly enough, were occasionally successful Contrary to the experience of earlier speakers, who in theif theaters had found to have a demoralizing effect on the enemy, the Mau Mau were quite indifferent to them, the more sO as the remained on the handler's leash: Cavalry (in answer to a question from COL. GALULA) did not as such exist in in the north, the police had some mounted patrols, but even there the horses were not used in battle BRIG. POWELL-JONES then questioned COL. KITSON on his experience with some of the minor tactical devices that the British had found useful in Malaya He mentioned technical aids, such as emitter valves planted on the enemy' s radios, which helped in spotting his locations and intercepting his contacts, and the use of laxatives, which; if added to the rebels' rice supplies, could incapacitate them quite effectively: COL. KITSON recalled an abortive attempt to plant an emitter in a walking stick for a terrorist leader (Kemafi) whom the British were eager to capture. He was skeptical of the idea of adulterating the enemy's food; even SO relatively harmless a as a laxative would quickly be construed as poison, which not Only would raise the issue of possible violation of the Geneva Conven- tion but would also be an invitation to the enemy to retaliate in kind ( very undesirable development in Africa, where the natives are unsurpassed in the art of poisoning). deal of research appears to have been done on the practicability of certain other methods and 'gimmicks MR RUTKOWSKI mentioned the possibility of introducing substances into the enemys body or environment that would permit his detection without incapacitating him GEN. LANSDALE spoke of tear gas, with dogs dogs dogs dogs Kenya; thing good BRITISH KENYA CAMPAIGN AND PERSONNEL FOR COUNTERINSURGENCY 133 its very brief life, which requires immediate follow-up action by troops wearing gas masks if it is to be at all useful. The consensus of the participants was that many of the 'gimmicks" that had been tried by counterinsurgents in various theaters did not have the hoped-for effect Going back to the specific case of COL. KITSON described the virtual impossibility of doctoring the terrorists' ammunition; a trick that had been used 4( quite successfully in several other theaters. The aforementioned committee system" by which ammunition was procured resulted in its coming in in very small quantities and being passed from hand to hand, instead of stored in quantity in locations to which the counterinsurgents might have hoped to access: Ammunition, incidentally,also took the place of currency, with one round equaling about $1, and thus rarely fell into the defenders' hands, except where it might accidentally have dropped out of a terrorist' s pack Truth serum a device that COL. GALULA mentioned as one he would like to have had at his disposal in Algeria COL KITSON had found quite ineffectual when used on African natives, whose moral code; being very different from the Judeo-Christian, does not include the Western concept that truth is good and untruth is bad. Asked whether this generalization would apply equally to Africans who are Catholics or Protestants, he pointed out that only one in a hundred of those baptized is & genuine believer, whose moral base is much the same aS ourS; the ninety-nine nominal Christians, who gO to the mission mainly for medical care or schooling, remain quite untouched by the gospel. In answer t0 a question from MR RUTKOWSKI about differences in techniques between and night operations in Kenya: Generally speaking, jungle operations were undertaken by and those inside the reserves and European areas by night In the jungle the Mau Mau, like regular troops, depended on guides; who could find their way only by daylight Inside the perimeter the Mau Mau attacked at night, and that was also the time, therefore, for antiterrorist ambushes: The only exceptions occurred in the early period of large Mau Mau concentrations, when occasionally groups of up to five hundred rebels would come out of the bush and spend two or three and nights in continuous raiding: The Mau Mau were, on the whole, poorly equipped with weapons, and about two-thirds of the men in a typical platoon had only the most primitive, homemade guns (sometimes a piece of wood and a length of pipe tied together with a bit of wire, a contraption that might O might not work, but which could kill a man if he were hit at close range and in a vulnerable spot). The real weapons varied greatly, because were whatever the Mau Mau had managed to steal. And, though the Kenya, being gain day day, big days they 134 COUNTERINSURGENCY: A SYMPOSIUM rebels might have been deadlier had stuck to their bows and arrows, some of them were good shots with Western guns What weapons had COL. KITSON found most effective against the Mau Mau? Best of all was the new (Belgian-made) NATO rifle, the "FN repeater;' a high- caliber, high-velocity superweapon. The Sten gun he regarded as less good, for it lacks the velocity that will fell the African who is swathed in blankets and, in any case, can absorb an unbelievable amount of lead without taking notice of it: The Bren gun is too heavy tO carry around in the circumstances of jungle warfare And the submachine gun is insufficient from the of view of velocity. In Malaya, by contrast; the light machine gun (in answer to BRIG. POWELL-JONES' question) was quite an effective ambush weapon, for the Chinese wore very few clothes, and their reactions to injufy and pain, in general, were much more like ours than like those of the African natives Even in Malaya, howevet, COL. KITSON's first choice would have been a rifle and, best of all, the five-round shotgun (the American Winchester); in Kenya he himself occasionally used his heavy English double- barreled shotgun: MR. HOSMER wanted to know when, precisely, the tide turned against the Mau Mau in Kenya, and hOw the British knew at a given point that were winning COL. KITSON: Politically, the tide turned shortly after the beginning of the emergency, in October 1952, with the arrest of all the intelligent, purposeful leaders, including Jomo Kenyatta (This carried out by the Special Branch with tWo Of three top agents, was the most efficient operation in the campaign ) Under the second-string leaders who took their place; the movement had neither a formulated aim nor real direction, and was doomed to eventual political failure Militarily, the tide turned in April 1954, when, in a single and unique opera- tion, the government forces broke the back of the elaborate committee system that ammunition, recruits, and money for the military organization: Concen- trating 0n the largest district in the south of the Kikuyu reserve (Kimbu, with a population of 350,000) and on the large Kikuyu element in Nairobi, the British began by rounding up the 70,000 Kikuyu in Nairobi and sending them to seashore camps 500 miles away; then isolated Nairobi from the Kimbu district by surrounding the with checkpoints at which intercepted supplies from Kimbu and tried to discover the identities of the committee members who had sent them. This was SO successful that for several months no supplies came through at all. When the organization seemed to be building up again, it took only another large pickup like the first to sever the connection permanently: And from June 1954 onward the gangs dwindled in size. They could no longer get the needed they point they feat, supplied they city they BRITISH KENYA CAMPAIGN AND PERSONNEL FOR COUNTERINSURGENCY 135 recruits, and thus could not afford the tremendous losses that accompanied their previous large-scale operations; nor did they have the means with which to feed and equip such large numbers The government retained the offensive until the end of the emergency. BRIG. POWELL-JONES saw in this account of the successful attack on the supply system in Kenya a perfect of the prime importance of food control in break- a guerrilla movement Turning the discussion away from the specific case of Kenya, MR HOSMER invited the participants" views on the general role of the "advisor' in counter- insurgency- The problem of the organization and training of advisory personnel being one of the most pressing today, he asked: "What criteria would you use; with personnel management people, to be certain of getting just the right type of people for staff or feld in counterguerrilla warfare?" COL FERTIG: When the problem arose at Fort in the effort tO develop a special forces capability, it became apparent that the American service organiza- tion provided no method whereby a person'$ suitability could be ascertained through data on an IBM card. General Collins, as Chief of Staff, directed that all officers with experience in guerrilla or counterguerrilla operations be designated by a letter following their serial number; which cut down greatly on the screening process. This procedure, followed at least through 1954 and possibly thereafter, runs counter to the Army's idea of the use of manpower; which is t0 eliminate the specialist; to make everyone capable in a wide variety of functions and situations, and to select personnel for their general usefulness rather than any special skill and experience: The British may have had a superior measuring system,to judge by the quality of their selection BRIG. POWELL-JONES doubted that the British had a system from which the Americans could profit They are quick to note a man' $ special experience and performance and to use him accordingly. But they have no machinery for testing a man's potential in advance of performance-an aim that BRIG. POWELL-JONES regards as the personnel man'$ civilian-life approach, and one impractical for any army, even a citizen'$ army. There is always in the British army a voluntary element ~a tradition that has produced Lawrence of Arabia and other geniuses But the run- of-the-mill man is spotted and selected for this kind of work because, at some time in his career, he has found himself; often by chance, in circumstances that afforded him an opportunity tO excel and show this special ability. COL. KITSON mentioned his own case: a Londoner; with no knowledge of the language or the area, and without any previous experience in intelligence opera- proof ing duty Bragg 136 COUNTERINSURGENCY : A SYMPOSIUM tions, in whom any special aptitude for the task in Kenya would have been impos sible to determine from the written record: COL GALULA s view: Only field performance, not any written record or advance test, permits you to gauge the value of a man in revolutionary warfare The qualities needed above all others are imagination and a capacity for organiza- tion; discipline is somewhat less important, because higher echelons can impose the necessary limits Once you find the right man it is essential, though contrary to all military tradition, that he be given responsibility at once: Therefore, the theater commander; whatever his rank, must have a free hand in pfomoting the men under him: (COL. GALULA himself had frequently, and successfully, placed an able sergeant from among the draftees in charge of a unit, instead of a less suitable officer:) This is the principle followed also by the revolutionaries, and it makes for a very quick and effcient natural selection among them GEN LANSDALE, referring to the particularly difficult task of the American army in having to select from vast numbers of men (first through IBM-machine and other mechanical methods, and thereafter by a personal, close-up screening process) , stressed the final and virtually insoluble problem of choosing from a roster of men seemingly equal in experience and aptitude the one possessing what he called the X-factor' L such intangible qualities as imagination and empathy Sa= which makes him stand out above the others The British, BRIG. POWELL-JONES granted, never had a comparable problem, as worked only on a relatively small scale and in places far apart in time and space. With them; volunteers have always been a major selection factor: In addi- tion, he repeated, there has been the element of chance by which men like Wingate and Bernhard Fergusson revealed their unique qualifications for the command tions were subsequently given: The man who shows himself as peculiarly suited to leadership in fevolutionary warfare, however, frequently presents a problem to the army that chooses him; for he is likely to operate in unorthodox ways, spending money and effort recklessly, ignoring discipline, ill-treating prisoners, and the like COL. BOHANNAN quoted an earlier remark of CAPT. JBAPES t0 the effect that the most suitable person is often 'the who is slightly mad" a view he regarded as characteristic of the British and French, and indubitably sound: Unfor- tunately, however; it was not likely to be shared by Americans, especially the 'personnel management' person, because America lacks those nations' traditional respect for the eccentric. As for still other ways of selecting the right man for counterguerrilla warfare, they posi- they chap typical BRITISH KENYA CAMPAIGN AND PERSONNEL FOR COUNTERINSURGENCY 137 COL. KITSON said that he would seek the recommendations of those with experi- 6( ence and judgment; though he admitted that the method was 'unscientific " COL GALULA described his own preferred procedure in picking leaders He would get a group of men together; explain his plans to them, invite a discussion, in the course of which he would soon spot his strongest supporters From these; he would then choose the man with the most imagination and leadership qualities and put him in command, on the assumption that he, in turn, would pick the right man to work under him_ This principle, COL. GALULA believes, is valid and workable at every stage, from theater command down to the task-force Ievel, provided always that you are prepared to remove the man at the top if he does not prove himself: Given the general agreement on the importance of the unorthodox military approach, BRIG. POWELL-JONES saw here a possible argument to support the con- tention that the civil and military top command should be centered in one man (as it had been in Malaya under Templer;, who was both High Commissioner and head of the m ilitary effort) Where this is organizationally not feasible, one will have to make sure that the civilian leadership is as unorthodox as the military: If it is not, the situation affords many opportunities for dangerous friction and disagreement: Turning from military problems to the discussion of nonmilitary techniques, MR HOSMER raised the question of what specific advice and indoctrination to give, for example, to Americans now going to South Vietnam. Aside from the aims already mentioned-understanding the needs and wishes of the populace, working with the civilians, and building up trust- S_ what should be the approach, especially in areas where the Western power is not in charge of operations and policy? What is the right kind of advisor, and what training must he be given? BRIG. POWELL-JONES pointed out that, as soon a5 you address yourself to the problem in a specific theater, many of the principles and conclusions you may have formulated in general discussions on the art of guerrilla and counterguerrilla warfare will have to be modified, and some abandoned. Fof example, the unor- thodoxy just mentioned as efficient and desirable from a military standpoint is apt to alienate the people by some of the highhanded and sometimes crude methods it involves; and thus may run counter to youf other major aim, which is to win the populace: Rather than try to reconcile the two objectives from the very first, it might be wise to admit the fact that they conflict and to realize them one at a time, by first establishing your military presence and then going o to win the hearts and minds of the people: In other words, granting that you simply cannot everybody happy at all times and still win a war, you may have to begin by impres- keep 138 COUNTERINSURGENCY: A SYMPOSIUM on the people, quickly and perhaps rather brutally, the fact that you are the strong side; once you have convinced them that you are going to succeed, YOU can then start making allowances for local needs, wishes, and prejudices On this principle, for example, General Templer devoted his first six months in Malaya to becoming a man feared; thereafter, he could afford to be kind Much the same approach, said COL. GALULA, was used successfully by General De Lattre, who arrived in Indochina at the height of chaos, and started out by restoring dis- cipline through some very harsh methods before he revealed himself as kind and generous This was not; however; strictly applicable to the case of South Vietnam, MR PHILLIPS pointed out The Vietnamese will have t0 conduct their war themselves, and the twofold task of the Americans, in their advisory role; is, first; to determine what the Vietnamese can do to solve their problem, and, next; to find ways ofhelp- them COL VALERIANO considered himself singularly well qualified to on the role of the advisof; as his country had the benefit of American advice and assist- ance for s0 many years His conclusions: Before the foreign advisor can become effective in the field, he has to be accepted by the natives,not because he represents an allied country or wears its uniform, but as a friend. Then he must inject his ideas in the form of suggestions and allow them to circulate where will exert influence on more and more people, so that; gradually, will penetrate to the higher levels Also, he must have a faculty for making people work together: (In the Philippines American advisors often mediated between jealous rivals) In the course of these efforts, he will become increasingly familiar with local conditions and personalities; he will for example, what the various battalion com- manders are of so thathe can direct more of his help to the less able, and encourage the more efficient to help themselves This led COL. SHIRLEY to return once more to the question of just how to recognize in advance a man' s aptitude for the function just outlined by COL: VALERIANO. He himself favored relying on the knowledge and recommendations of people with experience in the area, whose judgment he trusted ~ a method preferable to card-index screening for small-scale operations, but one admittedly useless for mass selections 0r for choosing a few men from & vast reservoir: COL. GALULA stressed his earlier point that a single good man found in such a way can be expected to recognize, train, and influence others like himself: COL FERTIG, on the other hand, had found in his own experience that the problem would always remain complicated by the imponderable factor that sing ing speak they they learn, doing, capable again proof BRITISH KENYA CAMPAIGN AND PERSONNEL FOR COUNTERINSURGENCY 139 makes the seemingly unlikely person emerge as the ablest: When he was left behind in the Philippines with 180 Americans five officers and the rest enlisted men from the four services-all of whom had refused to surrender, 109 volun- teered to stay on as guerrillas The very mildest among them was captured and mis- treated by the Japanese, managed to escape On the night before his hanging, and thereafter became COL FERTIG s finest small-unit commander ~ a development quite unforeseeable in terms of his background and basic disposition: COL. FERTIG granted, however, that men who refused to surrender; Or who took to the hills after escaping, were already a select group likely to include the potential leaders The participants concluded their discussion of the topic with an attempt to list the criteria that each would use were he to select personnel for work in areas such as Vietnam: COL VALERIANO thought that the first requirement was a man'$ willingness to do the job. (There was general agreement that it was well to begin with volunteers ) Next; he would inquire whether the candidate had had experience in guerrilla warfare and, failing that; whether he had been a keen student of the subject If he had none of those qualifications, COL. VALERIANO would tend to give preference to the man with a good liberal education In his opinion, the service academies, because of their excellent liberal-arts curriculum, afe likely to produce guerrilla leaders provided they become oriented to that kind of warfare COL, FERTIG did not entirely agree with COL. VALERIANO. In the Philippines, he pointed out; the percentage of academy graduates in command positions had been surprisingly small: If he were forced to select a group hurriedly, he:would choose men from the mountains of Kentucky, West Virginia, Tennessee, and the far West;or from the back country of Australia The mountaineer, in his experience, is the natural guerrilla fighter, able to use his wits and never afraid of being lost in the hills,as compared, for example, with from the Fast Coast of the United States, many of whom were terrified of the terrain in the Philippines To COL. KITSON, the theory about the value of special aptitudes and previous conditioning sounded convincing, but everything in his own: experience tended to disprove it: He and most of the men in his regiment had come from London, yet "On reviewing his own and COL. FERTIG'$ remarks on the background and skills likely t0 produce thebest officers (regular or reserve) for unconvenrional warfare; COL VALERIANO had a few additional comments His own observations during the Huk campaign had convinced him that the capable offcer typically had a liberal education combined with interests and aptitudes that were peculiarly suitable to guerrilla warfare: (Hunting as a peacetime hobby, for example; often proved a valuable assec ) A general education, therefore, seemed as sound basic requirement for an officer'$ commission for unconventional as it Was for conventional warfare, provided it was accompanied by the appropriate interests, skills, and, of course, motivation The initial advantage of the rural over the ucban individual was nOr a decisive one; On the contrary, once acclimated t0 guerrilla terrain, the man from the tended 10 be berter material for positions of command and responsibilicy because of superior intelligence and sense of organization: good boys good good city 140 COUNTERINSURGENCY : A SY MPOSIUM many took jungle life in their stride; while some of those raised on farms and in the mountains did not By and large, he would choose a healthy younger person, with the necessary energy and imagination, over an equally good older man; but he would prefer the older person to a young one that was less able BRIG. POWELL-JONES summed up the impossibility of making an omniscient; foolproof choice of personnel by pointing to the accidental factors,not susceptible t0 scientific categorizing Or pSychological measurement; on which so much in a man' $ subsequent career depended. A smooth first patrol, the good luck of havinga successful initial contact with the enemy, o the experience of particularly able leadership at the start may be enough to turn him into a good guerrilla fighter: COL. SHIRLEY agreed emphatically, calling this a point of central importance in the entire argument APRIL 20, 1962 , RM.* WINNING THE COUNTERGUERRILLA WAR Wben and How Do You Know That You Are Winning a Counterguerrilla War?

What are the precise factors to be included in a yardstick? What weight would you give, for example, to numbers of casualties Or to the incident fate of terrorism and guerrilla attacks? What are the most significant measurements?" Distinguishing between two kinds of signs, the military and the nonmilitary, COL. GALULA listed as foremost among the military indicators (1) whether the guerrillas are developing to a higher stage of warfare Or are going back to a lower one (in Algeria, the legitimate forces knew were winging when the rebels were forced to go from large guerrilla battles to smaller engagements, and from there back to terrorism); (2) how much strength the guerrillas can muster for a single operation; (3) the chart that shows the number of weapons in the enemys hands; (4) the number of ambushes directed at convoys the rebels' prime targets once have organized the population and go after the defenders' weapons and #Present: Col.

GALULA thought; were to be sought essentially in the actions and attitudes of the civilian population The most significant of these were (a) the number of volunteers for the counterinsurgent forces, (b) the amount of information 'spontaneously offered, and (c) people's readiness to violate the guerrillas' orders (to abstain from smoking, to avoid contact with the counter- insurgents, and similar rules) COL. VALERIANO' s experience in the Philippines confirmed COL. GALULA'$ observations In that theater all field units were required t0 maintain statistics, which were useful for measuring, not only whether or not the government forces were winning, but also whether their individual tactics were effective or in need of modification (for example, they helped in comparing the virtues of small- as against large-unit operations). The most dramatic indicator of over-all success, in COL. VALERIANO' s experience, was the spontaneous response of the populace in offering information, and people's active participation in the capture or the dis- abling of guerrilla contact men who came to the villages for liaison between the inhabitants and the armed insurgents Both COL. KITSON and cOL. BOHANNAN agreed immediately that the people' S voluntary co-operation and their disregard for the guerrillas' orders were important signs of victory, and indeed perhaps the only reliable ones They had found that such other phenomena as the number of weapons in the enemys hands and the size of individual engagements often could be explained in other ways; if were, in indications of weakening enemy strength, their significance might not be immediately apparent: For example, the date COL. KITSON had mentioned as the moment when the tide turned in Kenya, and the military reasons for it, were knowledge gained only by hindsight: On the basis of the week' s discussions as well as of personal experience, several of the participants, at MR HOSMER'$ suggestion, set forth their views on the essential (military and political) elements, and the order of their importance, in any attempt to defeat a guerrilla movement: COL GALULA listed three: determination at the top level, selection of able leaders, and knowledge of how to conduct a counterguerrilla war: The primacy of {6 resolution he regarded as a matter of historical fact; one could not, fof example, imagine a guerrilla movement in Russia in the of Stalin they fact; days WINNING THE COUNTERGUERRILLA WAR 143 COL VALERIANO agreed in essence, adding that the factors mentioned by COL. GALULA must be present at every level, from government circles down to the lowest operating groups As the case of the Philippines shows, motivation and determination on the part of the population are not enough without theoutstanding leader: Until the emergence of Magsaysay, the people had a difficult time despite their unquestionable resolution The appearance of such a leader may be a matter of accident, and one of the problems, therefore, is to recognize a man'$ value and then to place him in the position in which he can do the country the most To COL KITSON, the single most important thing for the counterguerrilla side is t0 have a political (or "civilian") policy clearly superior to that of the insurgents, so that the people will support the government, not as a result of intimidation and terrorism, but because they are convinced that its victory would be in their interest Moreover, the military plan must fully accord with the political: policy. COL SHIRLEY' $ comment that much of the Communists' success could. be ascribed precisely to their consistency in promising the political millennium while pursuing its attainment by military means prompted BRIG. POWELL-JONES to emphasize the importance of a to counter and surpass the communist promise of the future In most cases, he said, it will not do merely to aim fof a return to the status quo. (Had that been satisfactory, there probably would not have been_ a guerrilla movement,) The postwar must be a recognizable improvement; in which the cancer in the prewar situation the cause of the insurgency_has been removed. ([ As for the element of 'resolution;' the situation today is a peculiarly compli- cated one for the Americans, with their problem of how to inject military advice and assistance into the areas they themselves are resolved must be defended. Unless the governments and people of those countries, who will have to do the actual defending, are similarly determined, may regard some of the measures advo- cated by the United States as politically unpalatable, and the American purpose may be defeated as a result Another important requirement; mentioned by COL. GALULA, is the abilicy of the counterinsurgent side to sustain a protracted war if necessary, since the guer- rillas' interest lies in maintaining a chronic state of warfare; avoiding an acute struggle until such time as they can be certain of winning it: COL FERTIG pointed to an organizational and conceptual weakness in the American military organization, in which guerrilla and counterguerrilla warfare two facets of a single problem, in his opinion are treated as distinct problems and operated by two separate sections (one under the Chief of Staff, the other top such good. goa] goal they staff 144 COUNTERINSURGENCY : A SY MPOSIUM under Military Government), instead of having the problem in its entirety brought into focus in & single department of counterinsurgency. A more realistic and effec- tive organization would provide, in the area of operations, for a task group, in which would be concentrated all the assets necessary for the military mission at hand, and which would not be encumbered with policing and similar respon- sibilities COL. FERTIG looked on the establishment of the Country Team; with the Ambassador in charge, as & development in the direction he advocated The above remarks provoked some disagreement and discussion fegarding the desirable degree of specialization; the inseparability of the military from the administrative leadership in the theater of operations; the potential dangers of having the military element the chief authority in a joint controlling body; and the doubtful advantage of separating; in a counterinsurgent campaign, the strictly military tasks from such closely related missions as police work o the feeding, indoctrination, and relocation of the population Though there was no consensus on the points raised by COL. FERTIG, it was generally agreed that the misunder- standing was semantic rather than substantive MR PHILLIPS elaborated on the special difficulties one faced when operating in an advisory, not a controlling, capacity the present position of the United States in South Vietnam. His advice: Begin, as you might on a pilot project, by working with a few military commanders and local leaders, evolve ideas and methods with them, allow these to work their way through those men to the top echelons, and thus gradually infuence and eventually transform the whole country: Bear in mind always the importance of introducing YOur recommendations indirectly, and of allowing the direct impetus for changes in techaiques, or in the selection of personnel and leaders, to come from the local people, lest youc help be construed as interference and your presence resented. Above all,make friends_ who will then be predisposed to listen to your advice and to emulate your methods if prove successful. By initiating operations and building up a system of tech- niques you will create an opportunity for the emergence of able local leaders, who in turn will eventually build the political base (the national objective) that may have been lacking at the start; and who are capable of coping with dissension and corruption within theif country- MR PHILLIPS had seen this approach work in South Vietnam; where a few Americans, collaborating with the Vietnamese army in operations and advising a few Vietnamese who were successful and, as a result; became more and more infuential, contributed greatly to the change that took place within two years Whereas in 1954 President Diem was almost entirely surrounded by a disloyal special they WINNING THE COUNTERGUERRILLA WAR 145 army and police force, and the country was controlled in part by the Vietminh and in part by various religious sects with armies of their own,by 1956 the govern- ment was relatively stable and efficient,and the majority of the people supported it In MR. PHILLIPS' opinion, the same approach would yield the desired results in other areas today; he had some reservations about the present U.S. policy of sending thousands of Americans to South Vietnam, for he believed that saturating the country with advisors was not necessarily the best answer: BRIG. POWELL-JONES approved of such an empirical approach, the success of which was apparent in every theater where the British had been involved in helping an indigenous movement to success. Greece alone, he recalled, afforded two such examples: in the of Byron, and in the late 1940's and early 1950'$, when the Americans, in particular, contributed much to the communist defeat COL GALULA, who served as UN. observer in Greece from 1949 to the end of the war, that the problem of outside suppOrt there had been a somewhat simpler one than any faced today: The Greeks needed only technical advice, equipment; and training, having themselves from the very beginning the determination, the leadership, and the issue with which to defeat the Communists The latter; by con- trast; had no issue,and their cause was moribund also because of their alliance with the Albanians and Bulgarians, the natural enemies of the Greeks COL. BOHANNAN had no doubt that theDiem government,too, was determined to fight communism. He contrasted this with the situation in the Philippines, where during much of the eight-year rebellion the government; though anticommunist, was unwilling to take more than police action against the Huk forces, because many Filipinos did not want to disturb the business-as-usual atmosphere: The scene changed only as a result of the combined initiative of the Seventh Battalion Combat Team (under COL VALERIANO), which recognized the war as a serious conflict to be fought with every means available,and a new and aggressive Secretary of Defense, who saw the need to defeat the enemy not only militarily but in his struggle for the loyalty and support of the population The success of the resolute, unorthodox pacification policy under Magsaysay,as carried out by the army' s most effective outfit; though widely doubted at the start, was persuasive enough to change attitudes and tactics throughout the armed forces As for the government; Magsaysay and his advisors managed to commit the less aggressive top politicians to the new policy by seizing on purely rhetorical pronouncements out of Manila and treating them as policy statements to be acted on for a more vigorous pursuit of the war: The development in the Philippines proved to COL. BOHANNAN the equal days again argued 146 COUNTERINSURGENCY : A SYMPOSIUM importance, in any war of this kind, of intelligence, a resolute national leadership, and a sound policy toward the civilians combined with effective military action Comparing the task to a tripod, which must stand on all three or fall, he emphasized that this 'trinity' concept must at every level, from the top of the government down to the individual soldier whose threefold job it is to kill enemy soldiers, obtain information, and win the support of local inhabitants A question from MR RUTKOWSKI led into a lengthy examination of the lems associated with ultimate disengagement: As there will rarely be a formal surrender of the rebel forces (it was agreed that you must avoid giving the other side the stage as a formal enemy), how does a government know that a guerrilla war is over? If the national power is committed t0 "holding the line" against the insurgents, when and how can it justify disengagement? Where you have set out with a stated national objective, how do you know that you have attained it? (To use the analogy of the toothache, how can you tell whether the fact that the tooth has stopped hurting is proof that ithas healed or a sign that it is dead from a general infection that might fare up in the next tooth?) Assuming that no counter- guerrilla war is ever over until you have dried up the wellsprings of the guerrillas' ideological power, how can this factor be measured? In sum, how can you work out in advance an acceptable condition for disengagement that will prevent a premature withdrawal and at the same time protect you against staying too and becoming a resident occupying power? In Greece, COL. GALULA pointed out; the problem was rendered relatively simple by the Communists withdrawal into Albania, which was tantamount tO surrender: In Indochina (BRIG. POWELL-JONES) the French might have stopped the war much sooner had fastened in time on the simple political objective of handing the country over to the Vietnamese in a reasonably orderly condition Indeed_ MR RUTKOWSKI thought, the main answer to the problem may lie in the truism that you cannot separate military from political action; it is up to the government t0 state at the outset the political aim toward which the military leader can then orient himself instead of being forced to improvise Yet such an objective, said BRIG. POWELL-JONES, can be regarded as adequate only if it foresees a situa- tion in which law and order have been re-established to a degree that precludes a relapse upon the troops" withdrawal. The British achieved this in Cyprus And did also in Malaya, where, early in the emergency, they announced a program for their departure on the assumption that order would have been restored at a certain stage (a means of mobilizing public opinion and offering the locals an incentive for supporting the government) legs apply prob- again long they they WINNING THE COUNTERGUERRILLA WAR 147 The necessary political stability, MR PHILLIPS pointed out, will not be attained until the people of the country have a strong government of their own that they are willing to support: There is little danger, in his view; of the defenders' staying beyond the period that they are needed; the local government will probably be quick to suggest their withdrawal According to COL. BOHANNAN,the reverse is more likely to be the case American forces are almost invariably withdrawn pre- maturely in fesponse to political and economic pressures at home (an age-old problem, COL GALULA commented, which faced the sixth-century Roman com- mander Belisarius in his North African campaign as it did the French military leaders in Indochina) As the meeting went into its final houf, MR HOSMER asked the participants to list some of their suggestions for equipment, additional research, and ther desiderata that they had found lacking in their Own experience COL KITSON singled out the need for money as the one least recognized and most important in counterinsurgent campaigns; that is to say,fof enough ready cash in the pockets of those whose job it is to obtain information He himself had been compelled to use his private funds until he learned to 'steal from the terrorists His point received strong support from several of the participants. COL. GALULA ( had had to 'steal" from the government in Algiers; COL. FERTIG had "printed his own money. MR. PHILLIPS had observed the for ample small cash in Vietnam and Laos, not only to buy information, but also to solve local problems involved in carrying out a campaign to win the support f the people: For example, in an area of hostile Of unco-operative inhabitants, it might be necessary to hire men Or horses fof transport; Of, in a newly pacified area formerly held by the Vietminh, it would be a psychological factor of great value to be able to buy some of the produce of farmers who had difficulty selling their crops in the market: COL. FERTIG then described how he met these financial problems in the Philippines In the early of the anti-Japanese struggle, when he did not yet have the support of the civilian population, he had indeed printed his own emer- gency currency. In addition, each battalion received an allowance of 2000 pesos quarterly out of operational funds, for which there was no accounting (COL FERTIG had obtained in advance a written statement from the Army Finance Office to the effect that he owed nothing to the U.S. government) The troops were under strict orders never to steal from the population, and it was impressed on them that a peso in return for a chicken would make a friend of the farmer: Abuses and viola- tions were severely punished. And eventually, upon repeated request, the U.S government supplemented the emergency currency, somewhat excessively, with need days 148 COUNTERINSURGENCY : A SYMPOSIUM 8500,000 in Philippine peso bills (the greater part of which COL. FERTIG was able to turn back at the end of the war) With regard to technical equipment, the group felt though some refine- ments and gadgets heretofore unavailable to them might be helpful in the future, were not essential needs Guerrilla warfare, Said COL. GALULA, does not; in general, call for elaborate equipment beyond that at hand. Though climate, terrain, and other special factors may create certain special requirements, the unique demands of this kind of warfare are not so much for a new technology as for a novel philosophical approach to its over-all conduct MR PHILLIPS would have welcomed a means to broadcast out ofan airplane to people on the ground, such as enemy units who had to be persuaded to give up But the requested standard public address system never: arrived, nor would it or any other existing standard US Army equipment; in his opinion, have been entirely adequate. What was needed was a simple loudspeaker and amplifer that could be installed in 4 small aircraft with a minimum of difficulty and could be used to broadcast clearly, free of the engine's noise. COL. KITSON, recounting his own successful experience of playing records or making direct voice broadcasts from airplanes, denied that present equipment posed an insurmountable technical problem: But; as MR PHILLIPS pointed out, it required a person with considerable skill and many pieces of army equipment to devise & workable gadget: BRIG. POWELL-JONES' idea of a transmitter that could be placed in the enemys hands and thus give his whereabouts away seemed to MR PHILLIPS well worth exploring Also, he recalled the fruitless search of people on the psychological- warfare side for a self-contained tape recorder or amplifer-and-loudspeaker system, battery-run and portable, that could be placed in & camouflaged spot and, running at night, would whisper O imitate spirits and ghosts to frighten local guerrillas and villagers. COL. SHIRLEY saw a possible answer to some of these problems in the develop- (( ment of a large number of different modules" that could be assembled to meet varying requirements. He recalled the profound disappointment that followed the arrival of the first (American) voice aircraft in when this did not turn out to work immediately, though it was known to have been effective in the Philippines COL FERTIG, who had himself supervised the introduction and adaptation of this plane in Malaya, qualified COL SHIRLEY'$ statement The voice aircraft was not fully developed until the Korean war, where it was used in a program aimed at the surrender of the remaining communist guerrillas in South Vietnam. The voice messages were accompanied by drops of surrender leaflets and four-ounce packages that, they Malaya; WINNING THE COUNTERGUERRILLA WAR 149 of rice tO the hungry guerrillas, and the effectiveness of the program was shown by the fact that the majority of those who surrendered came in bearing leaflets COL BOHANNAN summed up the preceding discussion with the remark that the most critical need in counterinsurgent warfare is a support organization that is authorized and willing to get the commander in the field whatever he thinks he needs, within reason: COL. KITSON'$ point about the importance of ready money, in particulaf, could not be stated too strongly. Yet the Pentagon, though it might accept a field commander s losses in men as inevitable and not to be questioned, would undoubtedly balk at & request for a large sum of money to be spent at the commander' s discretion and within a short time on the pacification of a small area COL FERTIG agreed emphatically. The truth of these statements, he added, became doubly apparent as one looked at a single exception to the above generali- zations and at the striking results it yielded. At the time that a supply system for the anti-Japanese guerrillas in the Philippines was to be organized in Australia, General MacArthur left behind a signed statement to the effect that anything able in the theater was to be given to Commander Parsons (a Navy officer charged with the procurement and delivery of supplies by submarine to the Philippine guerrillas) if he requested it: As a fesult, the guerrilla forces received the excellent and ample equipment that accounted in large measure for their success * MR.
